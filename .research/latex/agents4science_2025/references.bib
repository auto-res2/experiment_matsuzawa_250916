@article{abboud-2020-impossibility,
 abstract = {To handle vast amounts of data, it is natural and popular to compress vectors
and matrices. When we compress a vector from size $N$ down to size $n \ll N$,
it certainly makes it easier to store and transmit efficiently, but does it
also make it easier to process?
  In this paper we consider lossless compression schemes, and ask if we can run
our computations on the compressed data as efficiently as if the original data
was that small. That is, if an operation has time complexity
$T(\rm{inputsize})$, can we perform it on the compressed representation in time
$T(n)$ rather than $T(N)$? We consider the most basic linear algebra
operations: inner product, matrix-vector multiplication, and matrix
multiplication. In particular, given two compressed vectors, can we compute
their inner product in time $O(n)$? Or perhaps we must decompress first and
then multiply, spending $\Omega(N)$ time?
  The answer depends on the compression scheme. While for simple ones such as
Run-Length-Encoding (RLE) the inner product can be done in $O(n)$ time, we
prove that this is impossible for compressions from a richer class: essentially
$n^2$ or even larger runtimes are needed in the worst case (under complexity
assumptions). This is the class of grammar-compressions containing most popular
methods such as the Lempel-Ziv family. These schemes are more compressing than
the simple RLE, but alas, we prove that performing computations on them is much
harder.},

attempts to simultaneously learn to compress and store a representative dataset
from a non i.i.d data stream, while only observing each sample once. A naive
application of auto-encoders in this setting encounters a major challenge:
representations derived from earlier encoder states must be usable by later
decoder states. We show how to use discrete auto-encoders to effectively
address this challenge and introduce Adaptive Quantization Modules (AQM) to
control variation in the compression ability of the module at any given stage
of learning. This enables selecting an appropriate compression for incoming
samples, while taking into account overall memory constraints and current
progress of the learned compression. Unlike previous methods, our approach does
not require any pretraining, even on challenging datasets. We show that using
AQM to replace standard episodic memory in continual learning settings leads to
significant gains on continual learning benchmarks. Furthermore we demonstrate
this approach with larger images, LiDAR, and reinforcement learning
environments.},

 abstract = {In continual learning (CL), a learner is faced with a sequence of tasks,
arriving one after the other, and the goal is to remember all the tasks once
the continual learning experience is finished. The prior art in CL uses
episodic memory, parameter regularization or extensible network structures to
reduce interference among tasks, but in the end, all the approaches learn
different tasks in a joint vector space. We believe this invariably leads to
interference among different tasks. We propose to learn tasks in different
(low-rank) vector subspaces that are kept orthogonal to each other in order to
minimize interference. Further, to keep the gradients of different tasks coming
from these subspaces orthogonal to each other, we learn isometric mappings by
posing network training as an optimization problem over the Stiefel manifold.
To the best of our understanding, we report, for the first time, strong results
over experience-replay baseline with and without memory on standard
classification benchmarks in continual learning. The code is made publicly

learned ones. This is especially challenging when one cannot access data from
previous tasks and when the model has a fixed capacity. Current
regularization-based continual learning algorithms need an external
representation and extra computation to measure the parameters'

Bayesian Neural Networks (UCB), where the learning rate adapts according to the
uncertainty defined in the probability distribution of the weights in networks.
Uncertainty is a natural way to identify \textit{what to remember} and
\textit{what to change} as we continually learn, and thus mitigate catastrophic
forgetting. We also show a variant of our model, which uses uncertainty for
weight pruning and retains task performance after pruning by saving binary
masks per tasks. We evaluate our UCB approach extensively on diverse object
classification datasets with short and long sequences of tasks and report
superior or on-par performance compared to existing approaches. Additionally,
we show that our model does not necessarily need task information at test time,
i.e. it does not presume knowledge of which task a sample belongs to.},

promising avenues for improving the effectiveness of sparse training methods,

@article{guo-2019-memory,
 abstract = {Reinforcement learning with sparse rewards is challenging because an agent
can rarely obtain non-zero rewards and hence, gradient-based optimization of
parameterized policies can be incremental and slow. Recent work demonstrated
that using a memory buffer of previous successful trajectories can result in
more effective policies. However, existing methods may overly exploit past
successful experiences, which can encourage the agent to adopt sub-optimal and
myopic behaviors. In this work, instead of focusing on good experiences with
limited diversity, we propose to learn a trajectory-conditioned policy to
follow and expand diverse past trajectories from a memory buffer. Our method
allows the agent to reach diverse regions in the state space and improve upon
the past trajectories to reach new states. We empirically show that our
approach significantly outperforms count-based exploration methods (parametric
approach) and self-imitation learning (parametric approach with non-parametric
memory) on various complex tasks with local optima. In particular, without
using expert demonstrations or resetting to arbitrary states, we achieve the

@article{jiao-2024-vector,
 abstract = {Continual learning requires to overcome catastrophic forgetting when training
a single model on a sequence of tasks. Recent top-performing approaches are
prompt-based methods that utilize a set of learnable parameters (i.e., prompts)
to encode task knowledge, from which appropriate ones are selected to guide the
fixed pre-trained model in generating features tailored to a certain task.
However, existing methods rely on predicting prompt identities for prompt
selection, where the identity prediction process cannot be optimized with task
loss. This limitation leads to sub-optimal prompt selection and inadequate
adaptation of pre-trained features for a specific task. Previous efforts have
tried to address this by directly generating prompts from input queries instead
of selecting from a set of candidates. However, these prompts are continuous,
which lack sufficient abstraction for task knowledge representation, making
them less effective for continual learning. To address these challenges, we
propose VQ-Prompt, a prompt-based continual learning method that incorporates
Vector Quantization (VQ) into end-to-end training of a set of discrete prompts.
In this way, VQ-Prompt can optimize the prompt selection process with task loss

@article{pan-2019-fuzzy,
 abstract = {Recent work has shown that sparse representations -- where only a small
percentage of units are active -- can significantly reduce interference. Those
works, however, relied on relatively complex regularization or meta-learning
approaches, that have only been used offline in a pre-training phase. In this
work, we pursue a direction that achieves sparsity by design, rather than by
learning. Specifically, we design an activation function that produces sparse
representations deterministically by construction, and so is more amenable to
online training. The idea relies on the simple approach of binning, but
overcomes the two key limitations of binning: zero gradients for the flat
regions almost everywhere, and lost precision -- reduced discrimination -- due
to coarse aggregation. We introduce a Fuzzy Tiling Activation (FTA) that
provides non-negligible gradients and produces overlap between bins that
improves discrimination. We first show that FTA is robust under covariate shift
in a synthetic online supervised learning problem, where we can vary the level
of correlation and drift. Then we move to the deep reinforcement learning
setting and investigate both value-based and policy gradient algorithms that
use neural networks with FTAs, in classic discrete control and Mujoco
continuous control environments. We show that algorithms equipped with FTAs are
able to learn a stable policy faster without needing target networks on most

@article{wang-2022-improving,
 abstract = {Task-free continual learning (CL) aims to learn a non-stationary data stream
without explicit task definitions and not forget previous knowledge. The widely
adopted memory replay approach could gradually become less effective for long
data streams, as the model may memorize the stored examples and overfit the
memory buffer. Second, existing methods overlook the high uncertainty in the
memory data distribution since there is a big gap between the memory data
distribution and the distribution of all the previous data examples. To address
these problems, for the first time, we propose a principled memory evolution
framework to dynamically evolve the memory data distribution by making the
memory buffer gradually harder to be memorized with distributionally robust
optimization (DRO). We then derive a family of methods to evolve the memory
buffer data in the continuous probability measure space with Wasserstein
gradient flow (WGF). The proposed DRO is w.r.t the worst-case evolved memory
data distribution, thus guarantees the model performance and learns
significantly more robust features than existing memory-replay-based methods.

the proposed methods for alleviating forgetting. As a by-product of the

Sparse Continual Learning(SparCL), which is the first study that leverages
sparsity to enable cost-effective continual learning on edge devices. SparCL
achieves both training acceleration and accuracy preservation through the
synergy of three aspects: weight sparsity, data efficiency, and gradient
sparsity. Specifically, we propose task-aware dynamic masking (TDM) to learn a
sparse network throughout the entire CL process, dynamic data removal (DDR) to
remove less informative training data, and dynamic gradient masking (DGM) to
sparsify the gradient updates. Each of them not only improves efficiency, but
also further mitigates catastrophic forgetting. SparCL consistently improves
the training efficiency of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) CL methods by at
most 23X less training FLOPs, and, surprisingly, further improves the SOTA

Therefore we investigate how to transform continual learning to an online

when to update the importance weights, ii) which data to use to update them,
and iii) how to accumulate the importance weights at each update step.

episodic memory, that stores few examples from previous tasks and then to
replay these examples when training for future tasks. In this work, we
empirically analyze the effectiveness of a very small episodic memory in a CL

rather different supervised learning benchmarks adapted to CL, a very simple
baseline, that jointly trains on both examples from the current task as well as
examples stored in the episodic memory, significantly outperforms specifically
designed CL approaches with and without episodic memory. Interestingly, we find
that repetitive training on even tiny memories of past tasks does not harm

In this work, we depart from this view and move the focus towards faster
remembering -- i.e measuring how quickly the network recovers performance
rather than measuring the network's performance without any adaptation. We
argue that in many settings this can be more effective and that it opens the
door to combining meta-learning and continual learning techniques, leveraging
their complementary advantages. We propose a framework specific for the
scenario where no information about task boundaries or task identity is given.
It relies on a separation of concerns into what task is being solved and how
the task should be solved. This framework is implemented by differentiating
task specific parameters from task agnostic parameters, where the latter are

are memory-based that store and replay a subset of training examples. However,
the utility of stored seen examples may diminish over time since CL models are
continually updated. Here, we propose Gradient based Memory EDiting (GMED), a
framework for editing stored examples in continuous input space via gradient
updates, in order to create more "challenging" examples for replay. GMED-edited
examples remain similar to their unedited forms, but can yield increased loss
in the upcoming model updates, thereby making the future replays more effective
in overcoming catastrophic forgetting. By construction, GMED can be seamlessly
applied in conjunction with other memory-based CL algorithms to bring further
improvement. Experiments validate the effectiveness of GMED, and our best
method significantly outperforms baselines and previous state-of-the-art on
five out of six datasets. Code can be found at https://github.com/INK-USC/GMED.},

@article{kirkpatrick-2016-overcoming,
 abstract = {The ability to learn tasks in a sequential fashion is crucial to the
development of artificial intelligence. Neural networks are not, in general,
capable of this and it has been widely thought that catastrophic forgetting is
an inevitable feature of connectionist models. We show that it is possible to
overcome this limitation and train networks that can maintain expertise on
tasks which they have not experienced for a long time. Our approach remembers
old tasks by selectively slowing down learning on the weights important for
those tasks. We demonstrate our approach is scalable and effective by solving a
set of classification tasks based on the MNIST hand written digit dataset and
by learning several Atari 2600 games sequentially.},

@article{lee-2020-neural,
 abstract = {Despite the growing interest in continual learning, most of its contemporary
works have been studied in a rather restricted setting where tasks are clearly
distinguishable, and task boundaries are known during training. However, if our
goal is to develop an algorithm that learns as humans do, this setting is far
from realistic, and it is essential to develop a methodology that works in a
task-free manner. Meanwhile, among several branches of continual learning,
expansion-based methods have the advantage of eliminating catastrophic
forgetting by allocating new resources to learn new data. In this work, we
propose an expansion-based approach for task-free continual learning. Our
model, named Continual Neural Dirichlet Process Mixture (CN-DPM), consists of a
set of neural network experts that are in charge of a subset of the data.
CN-DPM expands the number of experts in a principled way under the Bayesian
nonparametric framework. With extensive experiments, we show that our model
successfully performs task-free continual learning for both discriminative and
generative tasks such as image classification and image generation.},

@article{liu-2019-understanding,
 abstract = {It is known that the Langevin dynamics used in MCMC is the gradient flow of
the KL divergence on the Wasserstein space, which helps convergence analysis
and inspires recent particle-based variational inference methods (ParVIs). But
no more MCMC dynamics is understood in this way. In this work, by developing
novel concepts, we propose a theoretical framework that recognizes a general
MCMC dynamics as the fiber-gradient Hamiltonian flow on the Wasserstein space
of a fiber-Riemannian Poisson manifold. The "conservation + convergence"
structure of the flow gives a clear picture on the behavior of general MCMC
dynamics. The framework also enables ParVI simulation of MCMC dynamics, which
enriches the ParVI family with more efficient dynamics, and also adapts ParVI
advantages to MCMCs. We develop two ParVI methods for a particular MCMC
dynamics and demonstrate the benefits in experiments.},
