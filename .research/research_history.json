This has driven research focused on constructing and assessing specific architectural designs [59] tailored to various tasks. On the theoretical front, mostly the expressive power [51, 26] and computational capabilities [45] of GNNs have been studied. However, there is limited understanding of the underlying learning mechanics. We undertake a classical variant of GNNs, the Graph Attention Network (GAT) [48, 9]. It overcomes the limitation of standard neighborhood representation averaging in GCNs [29, 22] by employing a self-attention mechanism [47] on nodes. Attention performs a weighted aggregation over a node’s neighbors to learn their relative importance. This increases the expressiveness of the neural network. GAT is a popular model that continues to serve as strong baseline. However, a major limitation of message-passing GNNs in general, and therefore GATs as well, is severe performance degradation when the depth of the network is even slightly increased. SOTA results are reportedly achieved by models of 2 or 3 layers. This problem has largely been attributed to over-smoothing [35], a phenomenon in which node representations become indistinguishable when multiple layers are stacked. To relieve GNNs of over-smoothing, practical techniques inspired by classical deep neural networks tweak the training process, e.g. by normalization [11, 64, 65, 66] or regularization [38, 42, 55, 67], and impose architectural changes such as skip connections (dense 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023). arXiv:2310.07235v2  [cs.LG]  25 Oct 2023and residual) [34, 53] or offer other engineering solutions [ 33] or their combinations [ 12]. Other approaches to overcome over-smoothing include learning CNN-like spatial operators from random paths in the graph instead of the point-wise graph Laplacian operator [ 17] and learning adaptive receptive fields (different ‘effective’ neighborhoods for different nodes) [63, 36, 52]. Another problem associated with loss of performance in deeper networks is over-squashing [1], but we do not discuss it since non-attentive models are more susceptible to it, which is not our focus. Alternative causes for the challenged trainability of deeper GNNs beyond over-smoothing is hampered signal propagation during training (i.e. backpropagation) [25, 62, 13]. To alleviate this problem for GCNs, a dynamic addition of skip connections to vanilla-GCNs, which is guided by gradient flow, and a topology-aware isometric initialization are proposed in [ 25]. A combination of orthogonal initialization and regularization facilitates gradient flow in [21]. To the best of our knowledge, these are the only works that discuss the trainability issue of deep GNNs from the perspective of signal propagation, which studies a randomly initialized network at initialization. Here, we offer an insight into a mechanism that allows these approaches to improve the trainability of deeper networks that is related to the entire gradient flow dynamics. We focus in particular on GAT architectures and the specific challenges that are introduced by attention. Our work translates the concept of neuronwise balancedness from traditional deep neural networks to GNNs, where a deeper understanding of gradient dynamics has been developed and norm balanced- ness is a critical assumption that induces successful training conditions. One reason is that the degree of initial balancedness is conserved throughout the training dynamics as described by gradient flow (i.e. a model of gradient descent with infinitesimally small learning rate or step size). Concretely, for fully connected feed-forward networks and deep convolutional neural networks with continuous homogenous activation functions such as ReLUs, the difference between the squared l2-norms of incoming and outgoing parameters to a neuron stays approximately constant during training [ 15, 32]. Realistic optimization elements such as finite learning rates, batch stochasticity, momentum, and weight decay break the symmetries induced by these laws. Yet, gradient flow equations can be extended to take these practicalities into account [31]. Inspired by these advances, we derive a conservation law for GATs with positive homogeneous activation functions such as ReLUs. As GATs are a generalization of GCNs, most aspects of our insights can also be transferred to other architectures. Our consideration of the attention mechanism would also be novel in the context of classic feed-forward architectures and could have intriguing implications for transformers that are of independent interest. In this work, however, we focus on GATs and derive a relationship between model parameters and their gradients, which induces a conservation law under gradient flow. Based on this insight, we identify a reason for the lack of trainability in deeper GATs and GCNs, which can be alleviated with a balanced parameter initialization. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposal is effective in mitigating the highlighted trainability issues, as it leads to considerable training speed-ups and enables significant parameter changes across all layers. This establishes a causal relationship between trainability and parameter balancedness also empirically, as our theory predicts. The main theorem presented in this work serves as a stepping stone to studying the learning dynamics of positive homogeneous models with attention mechanisms such as transformers [47] and in particular, vision transformers which require depth more than NLP transformers[49]. Our contributions are as follows. • We derive a conservation law of gradient flow dynamics for GATs, including its variations such as shared feature weights and multiple attention heads. • This law offers an explanation for the lack of trainability of deeper GATs with standard initialization. • To demonstrate empirically that our theory has established a causal link between balancedness and trainability, we propose a balanced initialization scheme that improves the trainability of deeper networks and attains considerable speedup in training and convergence time, as our theory predicts. 2 Theory: Conservation laws in GATs Preliminaries For a graph G = (V, E) with node set V and edge set E ⊆ V × V , where the neighborhood of a node v is given as N(v) = {u|(u, v) ∈ E}, a GNN layer computes each node’s representation by aggregating over its neighbors’ representation. In GATs, this aggregation is weighted by parameterized attention coefficients αuv, which indicate the importance of node u for v. 2Table 1: Attributes of init. schemes Init. Feat. Attn. Bal.? Xav Xavier Xavier No XavZ Xavier Zero No BalX Xavier Zero Yes BalO LLortho Zero Yes Figure 1: Params. to balance for neuron i ∈ [nl] Given input representations hl−1 v for all nodes v ∈ V , a GAT 1 layer l transforms those to: hl v = ϕ( X u∈N(v) αl uv · Wl shl−1 u ), where (1) αl uv = exp((al)⊤ · LeakyReLU(Wl shl−1 u + Wl t hl−1 v ))P u′∈N(v) exp((al)⊤ · LeakyReLU(Wlshl−1 u′ + Wl t hl−1v ))) . (2) We consider ϕ to be a positively homogeneous activation functions (i.e ϕ(x) =xϕ′(x) and conse- quently, ϕ(ax) =aϕ(x) for positive scalars a), such as a ReLU ϕ(x) = max{x, 0} or LeakyReLU ϕ(x) = max{x, 0} + −α max{−x, 0}. The feature transformation weights Ws and Wt for source and target nodes, respectively, may also be shared such that W = Ws = Wt. Definition 2.1. Given training data {(xm, ym)}M m=1 ⊂ Rd × Rp for M ≤ V , let f : Rd → Rp be the function represented by a network constructed by stacking L GAT layers as defined in Eq. (1) and (2) with W = Ws = Wt and h0 m = g(xm). Each layer l ∈ [L] of size nl has associated parameters: a feature weight matrix Wl ∈ Rnl×nl−1 and an attention vector al ∈ Rnl, where n0 = d and nL = p. Given a differentiable loss function ℓ : Rd × Rp → R, the loss L = 1/M PM i=1 ℓ(f(xm), ym) is used to update model parameters w ∈ {Wl, al}L l=1 with learning rate γ by gradient descent, i.e., wt+1 = wt − γ∇wL, where ∇wL = [∂L/∂w1, . . . ,∂L/∂w|w|] and w0 is set by the initialization scheme. For an infinitesimal γ → 0, the dynamics of gradient descent behave similarly to gradient flow defined by dw/dt = −∇wL, where t is the continuous time index. We useW[i, :], W[:, i], and a[i] to denote the ith row of W, column of W, and entry ofa, respectively. Note that Wl[i, :] is the vector of weights incoming to neuron i ∈ [nl] and Wl+1[:, i] is the vector of weights outgoing from the same neuron. For the purpose of discussion, let i ∈ [dl], j∈ [dl−1], and k ∈ [dl+1], as depicted in Fig. 1. ⟨·, ·⟩ denotes the scalar product. Conservation Laws We focus the following exposition on weight-sharing GATs, as this variant has the practical benefit that it requires fewer parameters. Yet, similar laws also hold for the non-weight- sharing case, as we state and discuss in the supplement. For brevity, we also defer the discussion of laws for the multi-headed attention mechanism to the supplement. Theorem 2.2 (Structure of gradients). Given the feature weight and attention parameters Wl and al of a layer l in a GAT network as described in Def. 2.1, the structure of the gradients for layer l ∈ [L − 1] in the network is conserved according to the following law: ⟨Wl[i, :], ∇Wl[i,:]L⟩ − ⟨al[i], ∇al[i]L⟩ = ⟨Wl+1[:, i], ∇Wl+1[:,i]L⟩. (3) Corollary 2.3 (Norm conservation of weights incoming and outgoing at every neuron). Given the gradient structure of Theorem 2.2 and positive homogeneity of the activation ϕ in Eq. (1), gradient flow in the network adheres to the following invariance for l ∈ [L − 1]: d dt \u0010\r\rWl[i, :] \r\r2 − \r\ral[i] \r\r2\u0011 = d dt \u0010\r\rWl+1[: i] \r\r2\u0011 , (4) 1This definition of GAT is termed GATv2 in [9]. Hereafter, we refer to GATv2 as GAT. 3(a) δ with GD  (b) δ with Adam  (c) c with Xavier  (d) c with BalO Figure 2: Visualizing conservation laws: (a),(b) show δ ≈ 0 (can not empirically be exactly zero due to finite γ = 0.1) from Eq. (7) for hidden layers when L = 3. (c),(d) show the value of c from Eq. (5), which is determined by the initialization and should be 0 when the network is balanced, for L = 10 trained with GD. With Xav., the network is unbalanced and hence c ̸= 0for all neurons. With BalO, c = 0exactly at initialization for all neurons by design but during training, it varies slightly andc ≈ 0 as the network becomes slightly unbalanced due to the finite γ = 0.1. As both δ and c approximately meet their required value, we conclude that the derived law holds for practical purposes as well. It then directly follows by integration over time that the l2-norms of feature and attention weights incoming to and outgoing from a neuron are preserved such that \r\rWl[i, :] \r\r2 − \r\ral[i] \r\r2 − \r\rWl+1[: i] \r\r2 = c, (5) where c = d dt \u0010\r\rWl[i, :] \r\r2 − \r\ral[i] \r\r2\u0011 at initialization (i.e. t = 0). We denote the ‘degree of balancedness’ by c and call an initialization balanced if c = 0. Corollary 2.4 (Norm conservation across layers). Given Eq. (4), the invariance of gradient flow at the layer level for l ∈ [L − 1] by summing over i ∈ [nl] is: d dt \u0010\r\rWl\r\r2 F − \r\ral\r\r2\u0011 = d dt \u0010\r\rWl+1\r\r2 F \u0011 . (6) Remark 2.5. Similar conservation laws also hold for the original less expressive GAT version [48] as well as for the vanilla GCN [29] yielded by fixing al = 0. Insights We first verify our theory and then discuss its implications in the context of four different initializations for GATs, which are summarized in Table 1. Xavier (Xav.) initialization [19] is the standard default for GATs. We describe the Looks-Linear-Orthogonal (LLortho) initialization later. In order to empirically validate Theorem 2.2, we rewrite Equation 3 to define δ as: δ = ⟨Wl[i, :], ∇Wl[i,:]L⟩ − ⟨al, ∇alL⟩ − ⟨Wl+1[:, i], ∇Wl+1[:,i]L⟩ = 0. (7) We observe how the value of δ varies during training in Fig. 2 for both GD and Adam optimizers with γ = 0.1. Although the theory assumes infinitesimal learning rates due to gradient flow, it still holds sufficiently (δ ≈ 0) in practice for normally used learning rates as we validate in Fig. 2. Furthermore, although the theory assumes vanilla gradient descent optimization, it still holds for the Adam optimizer (Fig. 2b). This is so because the derived law on the level of scalar products between gradients and parameters (see Theorem 2.2) still holds, as it states a relationship between gradients and parameters that is independent of the learning rate or precise gradient updates. Having verified Theorem 2.2, we use it to deduce an explanation for a major trainability issue of GATs with Xavier initialization that is amplified with increased network depth. The main reason is that the last layer has a comparatively small average weight norm, as E \r\rWL[:, i] \r\r2 = 2nL/(nL + nL−1) << 1, where the number of outputs is smaller than the layer width nL << nL−1. In contrast, E \r\rWL−1[i, :] \r\r2 = 2nL−1/(nL−1 + nL−2) = 1 and EaL−1[i]2 = 2/(1 +nL−1). In consequence, the right-hand side of our derived conservation law nL−2X j=1 (WL−1 ij )2 ∇WL−1 ij L WL−1 ij − (aL−1 i )2 ∇aL−1 i L aL−1 i = nLX k=1 (WL ki)2 ∇WL ki L WL ki (8) 4(a) Frac. of sig. params with relative change > 0.05  (b) Rel. grad. norms of feat. wghts. & training curve Figure 3: For L = 5, a high fraction of parameters change, and gradients propagate to earlier layers for both the unbalanced and balanced initialization Xav. and BalO initialization achieve 75.5% and 79.9% test accuracy, respectively.

However, the balanced initialization is able to propagate gradients, change parameters, and thus attain training loss → 0. Xav. and Bal O achieve 39.3% and 80.2% test accuracy, respectively. Note that the balanced initialization in (b) is also able to train faster than the 5 layer network with Xavier initialization in Fig. 3b. is relatively small, as PnL k=1(WL ki)2 << 1, on average, while the weights on the left-hand side are orders of magnitude larger. This implies that the relative gradients on the left-hand side are likely relatively small to meet the equality unless all the signs of change are set in such a way that they satisfy the equality, which is highly unlikely during training. Therefore, relative gradients in layer L −1 and accordingly also the previous layers of the same dimension can only change in minor ways. The amplification of this trainability issue with depth can also be explained by the recursive substitu- tion of Theorem 2.2 in Eq. (8) that results in a telescoping series yielding: n1X j=1 n0X m=1 W(1) jm 2 ∇W(1) jm L W(1) jm − L−1X l=1 nlX o=1 a(l) o 2 ∇a(l) o L a(l) o = nL−1X i=1 nLX k=1 W(L) ki 2 ∇W(L) ki L W(L) ki (9) Generally, 2n1 < n0 and thus E \r\rW1[j :] \r\r2 = 2n1/(n1 + n0) < 1. Since the weights in the first layer and the gradients propagated to the first layer are both small, gradients of attention parameters of the intermediate hidden layers must also be very small in order to satisfy Eq. (9). Evidently, the problem aggravates with depth where the same value must now be distributed over the parameters and gradients of more layers. Note that the norms of the first and last layers are usually not arbitrary but rather determined by the input and output scale of the network. Analogously, we can see see how a balanced initialization would mitigate the problem. Equal weight norms \r\rWL−1[i, :] \r\r2 and \r\rWL[:, i] \r\r2 in Eq. (8) (as the attention parameters are set to 0 during balancing, see Procedure 2.6) would allow larger relative gradients in layerL − 1, as compared to the imbalanced case, that can enhance gradient flow in the network to earlier layers. In other words, gradients on both sides of the equation have equal room to drive parameter change. 5Figure 5: Relative gradient norms of feature (left axis, solid) and of attention (right axis, stylized) parameters for l ∈ [1, 5, 10] and L = 10, sampled every 25 epochs. Test accuracy is at the top. Both attention and feature gradients at the first, middle, and last layer of the network with both balanced initializations are much larger than with unbalanced initialization (note axis scales). To visualize the trainability issue, we study the relative change |(w∗−w0)/w∗|. of trained network parameters (w∗) w.r.t. their initial value. In order to observe meaningful relative change, we only con- sider parameters with a significant contribution to the model output (w∗ ≥ 10−4). We also plot the rel- ative gradient norms of the feature weights across all layers to visualize their propagation. We display these values forL = 5and L = 10in Fig. 3 and 4, respectively, and observe a stark contrast, similar to the trends in relative gradient norms of selected layers of a 10 layer GAT in Fig. 5. In all experiments, GAT was trained with the specified initialization on Cora using GD with γ = 0.1 for 5000 epochs. Interestingly, the attention parameters change most in the first layer and increasingly more towards the last layer, as seen in Fig. 3a and 4a. This is consistently observed in both the 5 and 10 layer networks if the initialization is balanced, but with unbalanced initialization, the 10 layer network is unable to produce the same effect. As our theory defines a coarse-level conservation law, such fine-grained training dynamics cannot be completely explained by it. Since the attention parameters are set to 0 in the balanced initializations (see Procedure 2.6), as ablation, we also observe the effect of initializing attention and feature parameters with zero and Xavier, respectively. From Eq.(2), al = 0leads to αuv = 1/|N(v)|, implying that all neighbors u of the node v are equally important at initialization. Intuitively, this allows the network to learn the importance of neighbors without any initially introduced bias and thus avoids the ‘chicken and egg’ problem that arises in the initialization of attention over nodes[30]. Although this helps generalization in some cases (see Fig. 6), it alone does not help the trainability issue as seen in Fig. 4a. It may in fact worsen it (see Fig. 5), which is explained by Eq. 8. These observations underline the further need for parameter balancing. Procedure 2.6 (Balancing). Based on Eq. (5) from the norm preservation law 2.3, we note that in order to achieve balancedness, (i.e. set c = 0in Eq.(5)), the randomly initialized parameters Wl and al must satisfy the following equality for l ∈ [L]: \r\rWl[i, :] \r\r2 − \r\ral[i] \r\r2 = \r\rWl+1[: i] \r\r2 This can be achieved by scaling the randomly initialized weights as follows: 1. Set al = 0 for l ∈ [L]. 2. Set W1[i, :] = W1[i,:] ∥W1[i,:]∥ √βi, for i ∈ [n1] where βi is a hyperparameter 3. Set Wl+1[:, i] = Wl+1[:,i] ∥Wl+1[:,i]∥ \r\rWl[i, :] \r\r for i ∈ [nl] and l ∈ [L − 1] In step 2, βi determines the initial squared norm of the incoming weights to neuron i in the first layer. It can be any constant thus also randomly sampled from a normal or uniform distribution. We explain why we set βi = 2for i ∈ [n1] in the context of an orthogonal initialization. Remark 2.7. This procedure balances the network starting from l = 1towards l = L. Yet, it could also be carried out in reverse order by first defining \r\rWL[:, i] \r\r2 = βi for i ∈ [nL−1]. Balanced Orthogonal Initialization The feature weights Wl for l ∈ [L] need to be initialized randomly before balancing, which can simply be done by using Xavier initialization. However, existing works have pointed out benefits of orthogonal initialization to achieve initial dynamical 6(a) Test accuracy (higher is better).  (b) Epochs to best model (lower is better). Figure 6: GAT trained on Cora using SGD isometry for DNNs and CNNs [37, 44, 23], as it enables training very deep architectures. In line with these findings, we initialize Wl, before balancing, to be an orthogonal matrix with a looks-linear (LL) mirrored block structure [46, 6], that achieves perfect dynamical isometry in perceptrons with ReLU activation functions. Due to the peculiarity of neighborhood aggregation, the same technique does not induce perfect dynamical isometry in GATs (or GNNs). Exploring how dynamical isometry can be achieved or approximated in general GNNs could be an interesting direction for future work. Nevertheless, using a (balanced) LL-orthogonal initialization enhances trainaibility, particularly of deeper models. We defer further discussion on the effects of orthogonal initialization, such as with identity matrices, to the appendix. We outline the initialization procedure as follows: Let ∥ and |= denote row-wise and column- wise matrix concatenation, respectively. Let us draw a random orthonormal submatrix Ul and define W1 = [U1 ∥ −U1] where U1 ∈ R n1 2 ×n0 , Wl = [[Ul ∥ −Ul] |= [−Ul ∥ Ul]] where Ul ∈ R nl 2 × nl−1 2 for l = {2, . . . , L− 1}, and WL = [UL |= −UL] where UL ∈ RnL× nl−1 2 . Since UL is an orthonormal matrix, \r\rWL[:, i] \r\r2 = 2by definition, and by recursive application of Eq. (2.3 (with al = 0), balancedness requires that \r\rW1[i :, ] \r\r2 = 2. Therefore, we set βi = 2for i ∈ n1. 3 Experiments The main purpose of our experiments is to verify the validity of our theoretical insights and deduce an explanation for a major trainability issue of GATs that is amplified with increased network depth. Based on our theory, we understand the striking observation in Figure 4a that the parameters of default Xavier initialized GATs struggle to change during training. We demonstrate the validity of our theory with the nature of our solution. As we balance the parameter initialization (see Procedure 2.6), we allow the gradient signal to pass through the network layers, which enables parameter changes during training in all GAT layers. In consequence, balanced initialization schemes achieve higher generalization performance and significant training speed ups in comparison with the default Xavier initialization. It also facilitates training deeper GAT models. To analyze this effect systematically, we study the different GAT initializations listed in Table 1 on generalization (in % accuracy) and training speedup (in epochs) using nine common benchmark datasets for semi-supervised node classification tasks. We defer dataset details to the supplement. We use the standard provided train/validation/test splits and have removed the isolated nodes from Citeseer. We use the Pytorch Geometric framework and run our experiments on either Nvidia T4 Tensor Core GPU with 15 GB RAM or Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU with 6 GB RAM. We allow each network to train, both with SGD and Adam, for 5000 epochs (unless it converges earlier, i.e. achieves training loss ≤ 10−4) and select the model state with the highest validation accuracy. For each experiment, the mean ±95% confidence interval over five runs is reported for accuracy and epochs to the best model. All reported results use ReLU activation, weight sharing and no biases, unless stated otherwise. No weight sharing leads to similar trends, which we therefore omit. SGD We first evaluate the performance of the different initialization schemes of GAT models using vanilla gradient descent. Since no results have been previously reported using SGD on these datasets, to the best of our knowledge, we find that setting a learning rate of 0.1, 0.05 and 0.005 for L = [2, 5], L = [10, 20], and L = 40, respectively, allows for reasonably stable training on Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed. For the remaining datasets, we set the learning rate to 0.05, 0.01, 0.005 and 0.0005 for 7Table 2: Mean accuracy(%) ± 95% CI over five runs of GAT with width= 64trained using SGD. Init.

Note that we do not perform fine-tuning of the learning rate or other hyperparameters with respect to performance and use the same settings for all initializations to allow fair comparison. Figure 6 highlights that models initialized with balanced parameters, Bal O, consistently achieve the best accuracy and significantly speed up training, even on shallow models of 2 layers. In line with our theory, the default Xavier (Xav) initialization hampers model training (see also Figure 4a). Interestingly, the default Xavier (Xav) initialized deeper models tend to improve in performance with width but cannot compete with balanced initialization schemes. For example, the accuracy achieved by Xav for L = 10increases from 24.7% to 68.7% when the width is increased from 64 to 512. We hypothesize that the reason why width aids generalization performance is that a higher number of (almost random) features supports better models. This would also be in line with studies of overparameterization in vanilla feed-forward architectures, where higher width also aids random feature models [2, 4, 57, 43]. The observation that width overparameterized models enable training deeper models may be of independent interest in the context of how overparameterization in GNNs may be helpful. However, training wider and deeper (hence overall larger) models is computationally inefficient, even for datasets with the magnitude of Cora. In contrast, the BalO initialized model for L = 10is already able to attain 79.7% even with width= 64and improves to 80.9% with width= 512. Primarily the 8(a) Test accuracy.  (b) Epochs to convergence. Figure 7: GAT with 64 hidden dimensions trained using Adam. parameter balancing must be responsible for the improved performance, as it is not sufficient to simply initialize the attention weights to zero, as shown in Figure 4a and 5. For the remaining datasets, we report only the performance of networks with 64 hidden dimension in Table 2 for brevity. Since we have considered the XavZ initialization only as an ablation study and find it to be ineffective (see Figure 6a), we do not discuss it any further. Note that for some datasets (e.g.Pubmed, Wisconsin), deeper models (e.g. L = 40) are unable to train at all with Xavier initialization, which explains the high variation in test accuracy across multiple runs as, in each run, the model essentially remains a random network. The reduced performance even with balanced initialization at higher depth may be due to a lack of convergence within5000 epochs. Nevertheless, the fact that the drop in performance is not drastic, but rather gradual as depth increases, indicates that the network is being trained, i.e. trainability is not an issue. As a stress test, we validate that GAT networks with balanced initialization maintain their trainability at even larger depths of 64 and 80 layers (see Fig. 9 in appendix). In fact, the improved performance and training speed-up of models with balanced initialization as opposed to models with standard initialization is upheld even more so for very deep networks. Apart from Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed, the other datasets are considered heterophilic in nature and standard GNN models do not perform very well on them. State-of-the-art performance on these datasets is achieved by specialized models. We do not compare with them for two reasons: i) they do not employ an attention mechanism, which is the focus of our investigations, but comprise various special architectural elements and ii) our aim is not to outperform the SOTA, but rather highlight a mechanism that underlies the learning dynamics and can be exploited to improve trainability. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of a balanced initialization in training deep GATs in comparison to LipschitzNorm [14], a normalization technique proposed specifically for training deep GNNs with self-attention layers such as GAT (see Table 6 in appendix). Adam Adam, the most commonly used optimizer for GNNs, stabilizes the training dynamics and can compensate partially for problematic initializations. However, the drop in performance with depth, though smaller, is inevitable with unbalanced initialization. As evident from Figure 7, BalO initialized models achieve higher accuracy than or at par with Xavier initialization and converge in fewer epochs. As we observe with SGD, this difference becomes more prominent with depth, despite the fact that Adam itself significantly improves the trainability of deeper networks over SGD. Our argument of small relative gradients (see Eq.(8)) also applies to Adam. We have used the initial learning rates reported in the literature [9]: 0.005 for Cora and Citeseer, and 0.01 for Pubmed for the 2 and 5 layer networks. To allow stable training of deeper networks, we reduce the initial learning rate by a factor 0.1 for the 10 and 20 layer networks on all three datasets. Architectural variations We also consider other architectural variations such as employing ELUs instead of ReLUs, using multiple attention heads, turning off weight sharing, and addition of standard elements such as weight decay and dropout. In all cases, the results follow a similar tendency as already reported. Due to a lack of space, we defer the exact results to the appendix. These variations further increase the performance of networks with our initialization proposals, which can therefore be regarded as complementary. Note that residual skip connections between layers are also supported 9in a balanced initialization provided their parameters are initialized with zero. However, to isolate the contribution of the initialization scheme and validate our theoretical insights, we have focused our exposition on the vanilla GAT version. Limitations The derived conservation law only applies to the self-attention defined in the original GAT and GATv2 models, and their architectural variations such as ωGAT[18] (see Fig. 10 in appendix). Note that the law also holds for the non-attentive GCNs (see Table 7 in appendix) which are a special case of GATs (where the attention parameters are simply zero). Modeling different kinds of self-attention such as the dot-product self-attention in [28] entails modification of the conservation law, which has been left for future work. 4 Discussion GATs [9] are powerful graph neural network models that form a cornerstone of learning from graph- based data. The dynamic attention mechanism provides them with high functional expressiveness, as they can flexibly assign different importance to neighbors based on their features. However, as we slightly increase the network depth, the attention and feature weights face difficulty changing during training, which prevents us from learning deeper and more complex models. We have derived an explanation of this issue in the form of a structural relationship between the gradients and parameters that are associated with a feature. This relationship implies a conservation law that preserves a sum of the respective squared weight and attention norms during gradient flow. Accordingly, if weight and attention norms are highly unbalanced as is the case in standard GAT initialization schemes, relative gradients for larger parameters do not have sufficient room to increase. This phenomenon is similar in nature to the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime [ 24, 54], where only the last linear layer of a classic feed-forward neural network architecture can adapt to a task. Conservation laws for basic feed-forward architectures [15, 3, 32] do not require an infinite width assumption like NTK-related theory and highlight more nuanced issues for trainability. Furthermore, they are intrinsically linked to implicit regularization effects during gradient descent [41]. Our results are of independent interest also in this context, as we incorporate the attention mechanism into the analysis, which has implications for sequence models and transformers as well. One of these implications is that an unbalanced initialization hampers the trainability of the involved parameters. Yet, the identification of the cause already contains an outline for its solution. Balancing the initial norms of feature and attention weights leads to more effective parameter changes and significantly faster convergence during training, even in shallow architectures. To further increase the trainability of feature weights, we endow them with a balanced orthogonal looks-linear structure, which induces perfect dynamical isometry in perceptrons [10] and thus enables signal to pass even through very deep architectures. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets have verified the validity of our theoretical insights and isolated the effect of different modifications of the initial parameters on the trainability of GATs. 5 Acknowledgements We gratefully acknowledge funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the Horizon Europe Framework Programme (HORIZON) for proposal number 101116395 SPARSE-ML. 10References [1] Uri Alon and Eran Yahav.

Scalar and element-wise products are denoted ⟨, ⟩ and ⊙, respectively. Boldface lowercase and uppercase symbols represent vectors and matrices, respectively. Our proof of Theorem 2.2 utilizes a rescale invariance that follows from Noether’s theorem, as stated by [31]. Note that we could also derive the gradient structure directly from the derivatives, but the rescale invariance is easier to follow. Definition 6.1 (Rescale invariance). The loss L(θ) is rescale invariant with respect to disjoint subsets of the parameters θ1 and θ2 if for every λ >0 we have L(θ) =L((λθ1, λ−1θ2, θd)), where θ = (θ1, θ2, θd). We frequently utilize the following relationship. Lemma 6.2 (Gradient structure due to rescale invariance [31]). The rescale invariance of L enforces the following geometric constraint on the gradients of the loss with respect to its parameters: ⟨θ1, ∇θ1 L⟩ − ⟨θ2, ∇θ2 L⟩ = 0. (10) We first use this rescale invariance to prove our main theorem for a GAT with shared feature transformation weights and a single attention head, as described in Def. 2.1. The underlying principle generalizes to other GAT versions as well, as we exemplify with two other variants. Firstly, we study the case of unshared weights for feature transformation of source and target nodes. Secondly, we discuss multiple attention heads. Proof of Theorem 2.2 Our main proof strategy relies on identifying a multiplicative rescale invariance in GATs that allows us to apply Lemma 6.2. We identify rescale invariances for every neuron i at layer l that induce the stated gradient structure. Specifically, we define the components of in-coming weights to the neuron as θ1 = {w | w ∈ Wl[i, : ]} and the union of all out-going edges (regarding features and attention) as θ2 = {w | w ∈ Wl+1[: , i]} ∪ {al[i]}. It is left to show that these parameters are invariant under rescaling. Let us, therefore, evaluate the GAT loss at λθ1 and λ−1θ2 and show that it remains invariant for any choice of λ >0. Note that the only components of the network that potentially change under rescaling are hl u[i], hl+1 v [j], and αl uv. We denote the scaled network components with a tilde resulting in ˜hl u[i], ˜hl+1 v [k], and ˜αl uv As we show, parameters of upper layers remain unaffected, as ˜hl+1 v [k] coincides with its original non-scaled variant ˜hl+1 v [k] =hl+1 v [k]. Let us start with the attention coefficients. Note that ˜al[i] =λ−1al[i] and ˜Wl[i, j] =λWl[i, j]. This implies that ˜αl uv = exp(el uv)P u′∈N(v) exp(eluv) = αl uv , because (11) ˜el uv = (al)⊤ · ϕ2(Wl(hl−1 u + hl−1 v )) =el uv, (12) which follows from the positive homogeneity of ϕ2 that allows ˜el uv = λ−1al[i]ϕ2( nl−1X j λWl[i, j](hl−1 u [j] +hl−1 v [j]) + nlX i′̸=i al[i]ϕ2( nl−1X j Wl[i, j](hl−1 u [j] +hl−1 v [j]) (13) = λ−1λal[i]ϕ2( nl−1X j Wl[i, j](hl−1 u [j] +hl−1 v [j]) + nlX i′̸=i al[i]ϕ2( nl−1X j Wl[i, j](hl−1 u [j] +hl−1 v [j]) (14) = el uv. (15) 15Since ˜αl uv = αl uv, it follows that ˜hu l [i] =ϕ1   X z∈N(u) αl zu nl−1X j λWl[i, j]hl−1 z [j]   = λϕ1   X z∈N(u) αl zu nl−1X j Wl[i, j]hl−1 z [j]   = λhl u[i] In the next layer, we therefore have ˜hl+1 v [k] =ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i λ−1Wl+1[k, i]˜hl u[i]   = ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i λ−1Wl+1[k, i]λhl u[i]   = ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i Wl+1[k, i]hl u[i]   = hl+1 v [k] Thus, the output node representations of the network remain unchanged, and according to Def. 6.1, the loss L is rescale-invariant. Consequently, as per Lemma 6.2, the constraint in Eq.(10) can be written as: ⟨Wl[i, :], ∇Wl[i,:]L⟩ − ⟨al[i], ∇al[i]L⟩ − ⟨Wl+1[:, i], ∇Wl+1[:,i]L⟩ = 0. which can be rearranged to Eq.((2.2): ⟨Wl[i, :], ∇Wl[i,:]L⟩ − ⟨al[i], ∇al[i]L⟩ = ⟨Wl+1[:, i], ∇Wl+1[:,i]L⟩. thus proving Theorem 2.2. Proof of Corollary 2.3 Given that gradient flow applied on loss L is captured by the differential equation dw dt = −∇wL (16) which implies: d dt \r\rWl[i, :] \r\r2 = 2⟨Wl[i, :], d dtWl[i, :]⟩ = −2⟨Wl[i, :], ∇Wl[i,:]L⟩ (17) substituting in Eq.(4) similarly for gradient flow of Wl+1[:, i] and al[i], as done in Eq.(17) yields Theorem 2.2: d dt \u0010\r\rWl[i, :] \r\r2 − \r\ral[i] \r\r2\u0011 = d dt \u0010\r\rWl+1[: i] \r\r2\u0011 . −2⟨Wl[i, :], ∇Wl[i,:]L⟩ −(−2)⟨al[i], ∇al[i]L⟩ = −2⟨Wl+1[:, i], ∇Wl+1[:,i]L⟩. Therefore, Eq.(4) and consequently Eq.(5) in Corollary 2.3 hold. Summing over i ∈ [nl] on both sides of Eq.(4) yields Corollary 2.4. 16Theorem 6.3 (Structure of gradients for GAT without weight-sharing). Let a GAT network as defined by Def. 2.1 consisting of L layers be given. The feature transformation parameters Wl s and Wl t of the source and target nodes of an edge and attention parametersal of a GAT layer l are defined according to Eq.(1) and (2). Then the gradients for layer l ∈ [L − 1] in the network are governed by the following law: ⟨Wl s[i, :], ∇Wls[i,:]L⟩ + ⟨Wl t [i, :], ∇Wl t [i,:]L⟩ − ⟨al[i], ∇al[i]L⟩ = ⟨Wl+1 s [:, i], ∇Wl+1 s [:,i]L⟩ (18) Proof. The proof is analogous to the derivation of Theorem 2.2. We follow the same principles and define the disjoint subsets θ1 and θ2 of the parameter set θ, associated with a neuron i in layer l accordingly, as follows: θ1 = {w|w ∈ Wl s[i, :]} ∪ {w|w ∈ Wl t [i, :]} θ2 = {w|w ∈ Wl+1 s [:, i]} ∪ {al[i]} Then, the invariance of node representations follows similarly to the proof of Theorem 2.2. The only components of the network that potentially change under rescaling are hl u[i], hl+1 v [j], and αl uv. We denote the scaled network components with a tilde resulting in ˜hl u[i], ˜hl+1 v [k], and ˜αl uv As we show, parameters of upper layers remain unaffected, as ˜hl+1 v [k] coincides with its original non-scaled variant ˜hl+1 v [k] =hl+1 v [k]. Let us start with the attention coefficients. Note that ˜al[i] =λ−1al[i], ˜Ws l [i, j] = λWl s[i, j] and ˜Wl t [i, j] =λWl t [i, j]. This implies that ˜αl uv = exp(el uv)P u′∈N(v) exp(eluv) = αl uv , because (19) ˜el uv = (al)⊤ · ϕ2(Wl shl−1 u + Wl t hl−1 v ) =el uv, (20) which follows from the positive homogeneity of ϕ2 that allows ˜el uv = λ−1al[i]ϕ2( nl−1X j λWl s[i, j]hl−1 u [j] +λWl t [i, j]hl−1 v [j] (21) + nlX i′̸=i al[i]ϕ2( nl−1X j Wl s[i, j]hl−1 u [j] +Wl t [i, j]hl−1 v [j]) (22) = λ−1λal[i]ϕ2( nl−1X j Wl s[i, j]hl−1 u [j] +Wl t [i, j]hl−1 v [j] (23) + nlX i′̸=i al[i]ϕ2( nl−1X j Wl s[i, j]hl−1 u [j] +Wl t [i, j]hl−1 v [j]) (24) = el uv. (25) Since ˜αl uv = αl uv, it follows that ˜hu l [i] =ϕ1   X z∈N(u) αl zu nl−1X j λWl s[i, j]hl−1 z [j]   = λϕ1   X z∈N(u) αl zu nl−1X j Wl s[i, j]hl−1 z [j]   = λhl u[i] 17In the next layer, we therefore have ˜hv l+1 [k] =ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i λ−1Wl+1 s [k, i]˜hl u[i]   = ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i λ−1Wl+1 s [k, i]λhl u[i]   = ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i Wl+1 s [k, i]hl u[i]   = hl+1 v [k] Thus, the application of Lemma 6.2 derives Theorem 6.3. Theorem 6.4 (Structure of gradients for GAT with multi-headed attention) . Given the feature transformation parameters Wl k and attention parameters al k of an attention head k ∈ [K] in a GAT layer of a L layer network. Then the gradients of layer l ∈ [L − 1] respect the law: KX k ⟨Wl k[i, :], ∇Wl k[i,:]L⟩ − KX k ⟨al k[i], ∇al k[i]L⟩ = KX k ⟨Wl+1 k [:, i], ∇Wl+1 k [:,i]L⟩. (26) Proof. Each attention head is independently defined by Eq.1 and Eq.2, and thus Theorem 2.2 holds for each head, separately. The aggregation of multiple heads in a layer is done over node representations of each head in either one of two ways: Concatenation: hl v =∥K k ϕ(P u∈N(v) αkuv l · Wl khl−1 u ) , or Average: hl v = 1 K PK k ϕ(P u∈N(v) αkuv l · Wl khl−1 u ) Thus, the rescale invariance and consequent structure of gradients of the parameters in each head are not altered and Eq.(6.2) holds by summation of the conservation law over all heads. For the most general case of a GAT layer without weight-sharing and with multi-headed attention, each term in Theorem 6.3 is summed over all heads. Further implications analogous to Corollary 2.3, and 2.4 can be derived for these variants by similar principles. 7 Training Dynamics In the main paper, we have shared observations regarding the learning dynamics of GAT networks of varying depths with standard initialization and or balanced initialization schemes. Here, we report additional figures for more varied depths to complete the picture. All figures in this section correspond to a L layer GAT network trained on Cora. For SGD, the learning rate is set to γ = 0.1, γ = 0.05 and γ = 0.01 for L = 5, L = 10and L = 20, respectively. For Adam, γ = 0.005 and γ = 0.0001 for L = 5and L = 10, respectively. Relative change of a feature transformation parameter w is defined as |(w∗−w0)/w∗| where w0 is the initialized value and w∗ is the value for the model with maximum validation accuracy during training. Absolute change |a∗ − a0| is used for attention parameters a since attention parameters are initialized with 0 in the balanced initialization. We view the fraction of parameters that remain unchanged during training separately in Figure 8, and examine the layer-wise distribution of change in parameters in Figure 11 without considering the unchanged parameters. To analyze how gradients vary in the network during training, we define the relative gradient norm of feature transformation and attention parameters for a layer l as ∥∇WlWl∥F/∥Wl∥F and ∥∇alal∥/∥al∥, respectively. Figures 3b and 4b, and Figure 12 depict relative gradient norms for training under SGD and Adam respectively. 18(a) L = 5  (b) L = 10  (c) L = 20 Figure 8: Layer-wise fraction of feature transformation parameters Wl and attention parameters al with zero relative and absolute change, respectively, trained with SGD. For L = 2, no parameters with zero change existed. A small number of feature weights do not change in a 5 layer unbalanced network initialized with Xavier, but this fraction becomes significantly large when depth is increased to L = 10. Note that W1 contains a much larger number of parameters compared to the intermediate layers (specifically in this case, though it is generally common). At L = 20, nearly all w ∈ Wl with an unbalanced initialization (Xav. and Xav+ZeroAtt) struggle to change during training, whereas the balanced Xavier and LL-orthogonal initialization are able to drive change in most w ∈ Wl and all a ∈ al parameters, allowing the network to train. 8 Additional Results The results of the main paper have focused on the vanilla GAT having ReLU activation between consecutive layers, a single attention head, and shared weights for feature transformation of the source and target nodes, optimized with vanilla gradient descent (or Adam) without any regularization. Here, we present additional results for training with architectural variations, comparing a balanced initialization with a normalization scheme focused on GATs, and discussing the impact of an orthogonal initialization and the applicability of the derived conservation law to other message- passing GNNs (MPGNNs). Training variations To understand the impact of different architectural variations, common regular- ization strategies such as dropout and weight decay, and different activation functions, we conducted additional experiments. For a 10-layer network with width 64, Table 3 and 4 report our results for SGD and Adam, respectively. The values of hyperparameters were taken from [48].

Dropout generally does not seem to be helpful to the deeper network ( L = 10), regardless of the initialization. From Table 3 and 4, it is evident that although techniques like dropout and weight decay may aid optimization, they are 19Table 4: Mean test accuracy(%) ± 95% CI over five runs of GAT trained on Cora using Adam Variation L Xav Bal X BalO None (Vanilla GAT) 5 76 .18 ± 1.61 79 .38 ± 2.24 80.20 ± 0.57 10 70 .86 ± 3.99 75 .72 ± 2.35 79.62 ± 1.27 attention heads = 8 5 75 .62 ± 1.74 78 .54 ± 1.06 79.56 ± 0.85 10 70 .94 ± 2.76 75 .48 ± 2.48 79.74 ± 1.10 activation = ELU 5 76 .56 ± 1.72 78 .72 ± 1.02 79.56 ± 0.64 10 75 .30 ± 1.42 78.48 ± 1.79 76.52 ± 0.97 dropout = 0.6 5 76 .74 ± 1.44 78 .42 ± 1.28 79.92 ± 0.48 10 32 .48 ± 6.99 31 .76 ± 1.33 76.34 ± 0.95 weight decay = 0.0005 5 75 .10 ± 2.05 78 .52 ± 1.41 79.80 ± 0.63 10 28 .74 ± 12.04 74 .68 ± 3.06 79.70 ± 1.14 weight sharing = False 5 76 .56 ± 1.72 78 .72 ± 1.02 79.56 ± 0.64 10 71 .12 ± 2.23 73 .32 ± 1.23 79.46 ± 1.16 alone not enough to enable the trainability of deeper network GATs and thus are complementary to balancedness. Note that ELU is not a positively homogeneous activation function, which is an assumption in out theory. In practice, however, it does not impact the Xavier-balanced initialization (Bal X). However, the Looks-Linear orthogonal structure is specific to ReLUs. Therefore, the orthogonality and balancedness of the Bal O initialization are negatively impacted by ELU, although the Adam optimizer seems to compensate for it to some extent. In addition to increasing the trainability of deeper networks, the balanced initialization matches the state-of-the-art performance of Xavier initialized 2 layer GAT, given the architecture and optimization hyperparameters as reported in [48]. We used an existing GAT implementation and training script2 of Cora that follows the original GAT(v1)[48] paper and added our balanced initialization to the code. As evident from Table 5, the balanced initialization matches SOTA performance of GAT(v1) on Cora (83-84%) (on a version of the dataset with duplicate edges). GAT(v2) achieved 78.5% accuracy on Pubmed but the corresponding hyperparameter values were not reported. Hence, we transferred them from [48]. This way, we are able to match the state-of-the-art performance of GAT(v2) on Pubmed, as shown in Table 5.

We use their provided code to reproduce their experiments on Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed for 2,5,10,20 and 40-layer GATs with Lipschitz normalization and compare them with LLortho+Bal initialization in Table 6. Note that Lipschitz normalization has been shown to outperform other previous normalization techniques for GNNs such as pair-norm [64] and layer-norm [5]. Impact of orthogonal initialization In the main paper, we have advocated and presented results for using a balanced LL-orthogonal initialization. Here, we discuss two special cases of orthogonal initialization (and their balanced versions): identity matrices that have also been used for GNNs in 2https://github.com/Diego999/pyGAT 20Table 6: Comparing a balanced LL-orthogonal initialization to Lipschitz normalization applied with a standard (imbalanced) Xavier initialization: the balanced initialization results in a much higher accuracy as the depth of the network increases.

In line with [18], identity and LLidentity are used to initialize the hidden layers while Xavier is used to initialize the first and last layers. A network initialized with identity is balanced by adjusting the weights of the first and last layer to have norm1 (as identity matrices have row-wise and column-wise norm). A network with LLidentity initialization is balanced to have norm 2 in the first and last layer, similar to LLortho initialization. We compare the performance using these four base initializations (one standard Xavier, and three orthogonal cases) and their balanced counterparts in Fig. 9. We observe that balancing an (LL-)orthogonal initialization results in an improvement in the general- ization ability of the network in most cases and speeds up training, particularly for deeper networks. However, note that an (LL-)orthogonal initialization itself also has a positive effect on trainability in particular of deep networks. Contributing to this fact is the mostly-balanced nature of an (LL- )orthogonal initialization i.e. given hidden layers of equal dimensions the network is balanced in all layers except the first and last layers (assuming zero attention parameters), which allows the model to train, as opposed to the more severely imbalanced standard Xavier initialization. This further enforces the key takeaway of our work that norm imbalance at initialization hampers the trainability of GATs. In addition, the LLortho+Bal initialization also speeds up training over the LLortho initialization even in cases in which the generalization performance of the model is at par for both initializations. Figure 9: GAT network with varying initialization trained using SGD. Note that identity initializations have also been explored in the context of standard feed-forward neural networks. While they tend to work in practice, the lack of induced feature diversity can be problematic from a theoretical point of view (see e.g. for a counter-example [7]). However, potentially due to the reasons regarding feature diversity and ReLU activation discussed above, the balanced looks-linear random orthogonal initialization (LLortho+Bal.) outperforms initialization with identity matrices (see Fig. 9). In most cases, the balanced versions outperform the imbalanced version of the base initialization and the performance gap becomes exceedingly large as network depth increases. 21Applicability to other MPGNNs As GAT is a generalization of the GCN, all theorems are also applicable to GCNs (where the attention parameters are simply0). We provide additional experiments in Table 7, comparing the performance of GCN models of varying depths with imbalanced and balanced initializations trained on Cora using the SGD optimizer. We use the same hyperparameters as reported for GAT. As expected, the trainability benefits of a balanced initialization are also evident in deeper GCN networks.

However, adapting the balanced initialization to different methods entails modification of the conservation law derived for GATs to correspond to the specific architecture of the other method. For example, the proposed balanced initialization can be applied directly to a more recent variant of GAT, ωGAT [18], for which the same conservation law holds and also benefits from a balanced initialization. We conduct additional experiments to verify this. The results in Fig. 10 follow a similar pattern as for GATs: a balanced orthogonal initialization with looks linear structure (LLortho+Bal) of ωGAT performs the best, particularly by a wide margin at much higher depths (64 and 80 layers). Figure 10: ωGAT network with varying trained on Cora. In this work, we focus our exposition on GATs and take the first step in modeling the training dynamics of attention-based models for graph learning. An intriguing direction for future work is to derive modifications in the conservation law for other attention-based models utilizing the dot-product self-attention mechanism such as SuperGAT [28] and other architectures based on Transformers[47], 22that are widely used in Large Language Models (LLMs) and have recently also been adapted for graph learning [58, 60]. 9 Datasets Summary We used nine benchmark datasets for the transductive node classification task in our experiments, as summarized in Table 8. For the Platenoid datasets (Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed) [56], we use the graphs provided by Pytorch Geometric (PyG), in which each link is saved as an undirected edge in both directions. However, the number of edges is not exactly double (for example, 5429 edges are reported in the raw Cora dataset, but the PyG dataset has 10556 < (2 × 5429)) edges as duplicate edges have been removed in preprocessing. We also remove isolated nodes in the Citeseer dataset. The WebKB (Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin), Wikipedia (Squirrel and Chameleon) and Actor datasets [39], are used from the replication package provided by [40], where duplicate edges are removed. All results in this paper are according to the dataset statistics reported in Table 8. Table 8: Summary of datasets used in experiments. Dataset Cora Cite. Pubmed Cham. Squi. Actor Corn.

The change distribution for the parameters in al is missing for l = 5and l ∈ [7, 10] because these parameters remain unchanged (see Fig.8). (b) L = 20: The same pattern as in L = 10is seen. However, the difference between the trainability of models with unbalanced and balanced initialization becomes even more prominent. No attention parameters change at all with standard Xavier initialization (and hence their change distribution is not visible in the plot). Figure 11: Distributions of the relative and absolute change in the values of feature transformation parameters Wl and attention parameters al, respectively, when trained using SGD with unbalanced (Xav. and Xav+ZeroAtt) and balanced (Xav+Bal and LLortho+Bal) initialization. The black markers in each standard box-whisker plot denote the mean. In general, larger changes occur in attention parameters at later layers closer to the output of the network, whereas feature parameters change more in the earlier layers at the input of the network. We observe this also from the perspective of relative gradients, as higher gradients cause higher parameter changes. 24(a) L = 5: test accuracy (left to right) is 71.6%, 76.2%, 77.3%, and 80.5%. (b) L = 10: test accuracy (left to right) is 63.2%, 68.8%, 71.8%, and 78.0%. Figure 12: Layer-wise relative gradient norms of GAT parameters trained with Adam, which in itself improves trainability over SGD, especially for L = 10(see Fig.4b) even with standard initialization. However, with a balanced initialization, the training is faster and the model also generalizes better, as evident from the significant margin in test accuracy. A general noticeable trend, particularly with balanced initialization, is that the attention parameters have higher gradients at the end of the network (and thus change more in the later layers (see Fig. 11)) whereas the feature parameters have high gradients at the start of the network. Also, it can be seen that the feature parameters begin to change a few epochs before the attention parameters change noticeably, while the attention parameters continue to change for a few more epochs after the gradients of feature parameters have dropped. We speculate a representational benefit could drive this behaviour, i.e. with depth, the learned representation of neighbors becomes increasingly informative for a node and thus leads to a higher activity of the attention mechanism. 25",

        "main_contributions": "The paper investigates the largely unexplored optimization and learning dynamics of Graph Attention Networks (GATs), a popular GNN architecture. It derives a conservation law of GAT gradient flow dynamics, explaining why a high portion of parameters in GATs with standard initialization struggle to change, a problem amplified in deeper networks. To address this, the authors devise a balanced initialization scheme that allows more effective gradient propagation, enabling trainability of deeper GATs and achieving considerable speedup in training and convergence time. The main theorem also serves as a stepping stone for studying the learning dynamics of positive homogeneous models with attention mechanisms.",
        "methodology": "The study focuses on GATs (specifically GATv2) with positive homogeneous activation functions. The core methodology involves: 1) **Theoretical Derivation**: Deriving a conservation law for GAT gradient flow dynamics based on rescale invariance and positive homogeneity of activation functions, which relates incoming and outgoing parameter gradients for each neuron. 2) **Balanced Initialization Scheme**: A procedure that sets attention parameters to zero and scales feature weights to satisfy the derived balancedness condition (i.e., `c=0` in the conservation law). This includes a **Balanced Orthogonal Initialization (BalO)** that combines the balancing procedure with a 'looks-linear mirrored block structure' orthogonal initialization for feature weights, known to aid dynamical isometry in other neural networks. The research also compares performance against standard Xavier initialization and an ablation with Xavier and zero attention.",
        "experimental_setup": "The experimental evaluation focuses on semi-supervised node classification tasks across nine common benchmark datasets: Planetoid (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed), WebKB (Cornell, Texas, Wisconsin), Wikipedia (Squirrel, Chameleon), and Actor. Experiments were conducted using the Pytorch Geometric framework on Nvidia T4 or RTX 3060 GPUs. Models were trained for up to 5000 epochs with SGD and Adam optimizers, selecting the best model based on validation accuracy over five runs. Key architectural settings included ReLU activation, weight sharing, and no biases (unless specified). Performance was measured by test accuracy (%) and epochs to convergence (training speedup). Additional experiments explored architectural variations (ELU, multiple attention heads, no weight sharing, dropout, weight decay), compared against Lipschitz Normalization, and extended to GCNs and ωGAT models.",
        "limitations": "The derived conservation law is specific to the self-attention mechanisms in the original GAT and GATv2 models, and variations like ωGAT; it requires modification for other types of self-attention (e.g., dot-product in SuperGAT). The theoretical assumption of positive homogeneity for activation functions is not met by ELU, which can negatively impact the BalO initialization. The study notes that dropout is generally not helpful for deeper networks. While wider models can improve performance for unbalanced initializations, this approach is computationally inefficient. The theory, being coarse-grained, cannot fully explain fine-grained training dynamics, such as layer-specific changes in attention parameters. Additionally, orthogonal initializations (e.g., LLidentity) may lack induced feature diversity from a theoretical standpoint.",
        "future_research_directions": "Future research could explore how to achieve or approximate dynamical isometry in general GNNs. Another promising direction is to derive modifications in the conservation law for other attention-based models, particularly those utilizing dot-product self-attention mechanisms like SuperGAT, and extending the analysis to Transformer-based architectures used in Large Language Models and graph learning. The work also paves the way for further study into the learning dynamics of positive homogeneous models with attention mechanisms, such as vision transformers. Finally, the paper suggests further investigation into how overparameterization might be helpful in GNNs, given observations that increased width can aid generalization for deeper, Xavier-initialized models.",

Introduction Graph neural networks (GNNs) (Gori et al., 2005) are a standard class of models for machine learning on graph- structured data that utilize node feature and graph struc- ture information jointly to achieve strong empirical per- formance, particularly on node classification tasks. In- put graphs to GNNs stem from various domains of real- world systems such as social (Bian et al., 2020), com- mercial (Zhang & Chen, 2020), academic (Hamaguchi et al., 2017), economic (Monken et al., 2021), biochem- ical(Kearnes et al., 2016), physical (Shlomi et al., 2021), and transport (Wu et al., 2019) networks that are diverse in their node feature and graph structure properties. 1CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, 66123 Saarbr¨ucken, Germany. Correspondence to: Nimrah Mustafa <nimrah.mustafa@cispa.de>. Proceedings of the 41 st International Conference on Machine Learning, Vienna, Austria. PMLR 235, 2024. Copyright 2024 by the author(s). The message-passing mechanism of GNNs (Kipf & Welling, 2017; Xu et al., 2019) involves two key steps: a transformation of the node features, and the aggregation of these transformed features from a node’s neighborhood to update the node’s representation during training. While this has proven to be largely successful in certain cases, it gen- erally introduces some problems for learning with GNNs, the most notorious of which is over-smoothing (Li et al., 2018). The enforced use of structural information in ad- dition to node features may be detrimental to learning the node classification task, as shown by recent results where state-of-the-art GNNs perform the same as or worse than multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) (Gomes et al., 2022; Yan et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2022). One such task is where node labels can be easily determined by informative node fea- tures and require no contribution from the neighborhood. Here, standard neighborhood aggregation, as in most GNN architectures, would impair model performance, particu- larly with an increase in model depth. A popular standard GNN architecture that, in principle, tries to resolve this problem is the Graph Attention Net- work (GAT) (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2018; Brody et al., 2022). By design, neighborhood aggregation in GATs is charac- terized by learnable coefficients intended to assign larger weights to more important neighboring nodes (including the node itself) in order to learn better node representations. Therefore, in the above example, GATs should ideally re- sort to assigning near-zero importance to neighbor nodes, effectively switching off neighborhood aggregation. How- ever, we find that, counter-intuitively, GATs are unable to do this in practice and continue to aggregate the uninforma- tive features in the neighborhood which impedes learning. One may ask why one would employ a GAT (or any GNN architecture) if an MLP suffices. In practice, we do not know whether neighborhood aggregation (of raw features or features transformed by a perceptron or MLP), would be beneficial or not beforehand. This raises a pertinent ques- tion for the GNN research community: How much neigh- borhood aggregation is needed for a given task? . Ideally, it is what we would want a model to learn. Otherwise, the right task-specific architecture would need to be identified by time and resource-intensive manual tuning. We address the challenge faced by GAT to effectively de- 1 arXiv:2406.00418v2  [cs.LG]  29 Jul 2024GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors termine how well a node is represented by its own features compared to the features of neighboring nodes, i.e., dis- tinguish between the relative importance of available node features and graph structure information for a given task. Firstly, we provide an intuitive explanation for the problem based on a conservation law of GAT gradient flow dynam- ics derived by Mustafa & Burkholz (2023). Building on this insight, we present GATE, an extension of the GAT architecture that can switch neighborhood aggregation on and off as necessary. This allows our proposed architecture to gain the following advantages over GAT: 1. It alleviates the notorious over-smoothing problem by addressing the root cause of unnecessarily repeated neighborhood aggregation. 2. It allows the model to benefit from more meaningful representations obtained solely by deeper non-linear transformations, similarly to perceptrons, in layers with little to no neighborhood aggregation. 3. It often outperforms GATs on real-world heterophilic datasets by weighing down unrelated neighbors. 4. It offers interpretable learned self-attention coeffi- cients, at the node level, that are indicative of the rel- ative importance of feature and structure information in the locality of the node. In order to validate these claims, we construct a syn- thetic test bed of two opposite types of learning problems for node classification where label-relevant information is completely present only in a node’s i) own features and ii) neighboring nodes’ features (see Fig. 2). GATE is able to adapt to both cases as necessary. On real-world datasets, GATE performs competitively on homophilic datasets and is substantially better than GAT on heterophilic datasets. Furthermore, up to our knowledge, it achieves a new state of the art on the relatively large OGB-arxiv dataset (Hu et al., 2021) (i.e., 79.57 ± 0.84% test accuracy). In sum- mary, our contributions are as follows: • We identify and experimentally demonstrate a struc- tural limitation of GAT, i.e., its inability to switch off neighborhood aggregation. • We propose GATE, an extension of GAT, that over- comes this limitation and, in doing so, unlocks several benefits of the architecture. • We update an existing conservation law relating the structure of gradients in GAT to GATE. • We construct a synthetic test bed to validate our claims, which could be of independent interest to mea- sure progress in developing adaptive neighborhood aggregation schemes. Figure 1: MLP only performs node feature transforma- tions, whereas GAT also always aggregates over the neigh- borhood. With the ability to switch off neighborhood ag- gregation, GATE can learn to emulate MLP behavior and potentially interleave effective perceptron and standard lay- ers in a flexible manner. This allows for more expressive power that we find to benefit real-world tasks (see Table 3). 2. Related Work To relieve GNNs from the drawbacks of unnecessarily re- peated neighborhood aggregation in deeper models, ini- tial techniques were inspired by classical deep learning of MLPs such as normalization (Cai et al., 2021; Zhao & Akoglu, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; 2021) and regularization (Papp et al., 2021; Rong et al., 2020; Yang et al., 202; Zou et al., 2019). More recently, the need for deeper models and architectural changes to limit neighborhood aggregation as necessary has been recognized. Some approaches use linear combi- nations of initial features and current layer representation (Gasteiger et al., 2019), add skip connections and identity mapping (Chen et al., 2020; Cong et al., 2021), combine representations of all previous layers at the last layer (Xu et al., 2018), aggregate information from a node-wise de- fined range of k-hop neighbors(Liu et al., 2020), and limit the number of aggregation iterations based on node influ- ence scores (Zhang et al., 2021). However, these architec- tures are not flexible enough to utilize additional network layers to simulate perceptron behavior, which, as we find, benefits heterophilic tasks. (Ma et al., 2023) discuss ‘good’ and ‘bad’ heterophily, which are also task-dependent. Other contemporary works for general GNNs propose the use of bilevel optimization to determine a node’s strategic discrete action to a received message (Finkelshtein et al., 2023) and a variational inference framework for adaptive message passing (Errica et al., 2023). While these non- attentive architectures improve message passing in GNNs, we focus on identifying and explaining a structural limita- tion of self-attention in GAT, that continues to be used as a strong baseline architecture. An orthogonal line of research uses graph structural learn- ing (Yang et al., 2019; Stretcu et al., 2019; Franceschi et al., 2020) to amend the input graph structure such that neighborhood aggregation benefits the given task. Such 2GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors approaches are difficult to scale, more susceptible to over- smoothing, and potentially destroy any inherent informa- tion in the original graph structure. On the contrary, a standard GNN architecture equipped to selectively per- form neighborhood aggregation avoids these pitfalls. Self- supervision of the attention mechanism has also been pro- posed (Wang et al., 2019; Kim & Oh, 2021). Methods such as graph rewiring (Deac et al., 2022) to overcome problems such as over-squashing (Alon & Yahav, 2021) are comple- mentary and may also be combined with GATE. While we focus our insights on GAT, architectures based on GAT such as ωGAT (Eliasof et al., 2023) also suffer from the same problem (see Fig. 14 in Appendix C). This further confirms that the universal problem with GAT has been correctly identified. In general, recent works direct ef- fort to understand the current limitations of graph attention (Lee et al., 2023; Fountoulakis et al., 2023). 3. Architecture Notation Consider a graph G = ( V, E) with node set V and edge set E ⊆ V × V, where for a node v ∈ V the neighborhood is N(v) = {u|(u, v) ∈ E} and input features are h0 v. A GNN layer updates each node’s repre- sentation by aggregating over its neighbors’ representation and combining it with its own features. The aggregation and combination steps can be performed together by in- troducing self-loops in G such that, ∀v ∈ V, (v, v) ∈ E. We assume the presence of self-loops in G unless spec- ified otherwise. In GATs, this aggregation is weighted by parameterized attention coefficients αuv, which indi- cate the importance of node u for v. A network is con- structed by stacking L layers, defined as follows, using a non-linear activation function ϕ that is homogeneous (i.e ϕ(x) = xϕ′(x)) and consequently, ϕ(ax) = aϕ(x) for positive scalars a) such as ReLU ϕ(x) = max {x, 0} or LeakyReLU ϕ(x) = max{x, 0} + −α max{−x, 0}. GAT Given input representations hl−1 v for v ∈ V, a GAT 1 layer l ∈ [L] transforms those to: hl v = ϕ   X u∈N(v) αl uv · Wl shl−1 u  , where (1) αl uv = exp \u0000 el uv \u0001 P u′∈N(v) exp \u0000 el u′v \u0001, and (2) el uv = \u0000 al\u0001⊤ · ϕ \u0000 Wl shl−1 u + Wl thl−1 v \u0001 (3) The feature transformation weights Ws and Wt for source and target nodes, respectively, may also be shared such that Ws = Wt. We denote this variant of GAT by GATS. 1Throughout, we refer to GATv2 (Brody et al., 2022) as GAT. GATE In addition, we propose GATE, a GAT variant that flexibly weights the importance of node features and neigh- borhood features. A GATE layer is also defined by Eq. (1) and (2) but modifies euv in Eq. (3) to Eq. (4). el uv = \u0000 1u̸=val s + 1u=val t \u0001⊤ ·ϕ \u0000 Ulhl−1 u + Vlhl−1 v \u0001 . (4) We denote euv in Eq. (3) and (4) as el vv if u = v. For GATE, Wl s in Eq. (1) is denoted as Wl. A weight- sharing variant of GATE, GATE S, is characterized by all feature transformation parameters being shared in a layer (i.e. Wl = Ul = Vl). Note that, then, for a d-dimensional layer, GATE adds onlyd more parameters to GAT. We next present theoretical insights into the reasoning be- hind the inability of GATs to switch off neighborhood ag- gregation, which is rooted in norm constraints imposed by the inherent conservation law for GATs. The gradients of GATE fulfill an updated conservation law (Thoerem 4.3) that enables switching off neighborhood aggregation in a parameter regime with well-trainable attention. 4. Theoretical Insights For simplicity, we limit our discussion here to GATs with weight sharing. We derive similar arguments for GATs without weight sharing in Appendix A.1. The following conservation law was recently derived for GATs to explain trainability issues of standard initialization schemes. Even with improved initializations, we argue that this law lim- its the effective expressiveness of GATs and their ability to switch off neighborhood aggregation when necessary. Theorem 4.1 (Thm. 2.2 by Mustafa & Burkholz (2023)) . The parameters θ of a layer l ∈ [L − 1] in a GAT network and their gradients ∇θL w.r.t. loss L fulfill: ⟨Wl [i,:], ∇Wl [i,:] ⟩ = ⟨Wl+1 [:,i] , ∇Wl+1 [:,i] ⟩ + ⟨al [i], ∇al [i] ⟩. (5) Intuitively, this equality limits the budget for the relative change of parameters and imposes indirectly a norm con- straint on the parameters. Under gradient flow that assumes infinitesimally small learning rates, this law implies that the relationship \r\rWl[i, :] \r\r2 − \r\ral[i] \r\r2 − \r\rWl+1[: i] \r\r2 = c stays constant during training, where c is defined by the initial norms. Other gradient-based optimizers fulfill this norm balance also approximately. Note that the norms\r\rWl[i, :] \r\r generally do not assume arbitrary values but are determined by the required scale of the output. Deeper models are especially less flexible in varying these norms as deviations could lead to exploding or diminishing out- puts and/or gradients. In consequence, the norms of the attention parameters are also bounded. Furthermore, a pa- rameter becomes harder to change during training when its 3GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors magnitude increases. This can be seen by transforming the law with respect to the relative change of a parameter de- fined as ∆θ = ∇θL/θ for θ ̸= 0 or ∆θ = 0 for θ = 0. nl+1X j=1 Wl ij 2 ∆Wl ij = nl+2X k=1 Wl+1 ki 2 ∆Wl+1 ki + al i 2 ∆al i. (6) The higher the magnitude of an attention parameter (al i)2, the smaller will be the relative change ∆al i and vice versa. This restricts the attention mechanism in the network to a less-trainable regime without converging to a meaningful model. We next explain why large \r\ral\r\r are required to switch off neighborhood aggregation in a layer. Insight 4.2 (Effective expressiveness of GATs). GATs are challenged to switch off neighborhood aggregation during training, as this requires the model to enter a less trainable regime with large attention parameters ∥a∥2 >> 1. An intuitive derivation of this insight is presented in the appendix. Here, we outline the main argument based on the observation that to make the contribution of neighbor j insignificant relative to node i, we require αij/αii << 1. We use relativeαij/αii instead of αij and αii to cancel out normalization constants and simplify the analysis. Our key observation is that, given an insignificant link (i, j), its relative contribution to its two neighborhoods αij/αii << 1 and αji/αjj << 1 are affected in oppo- site ways by a feature f of the attention parameters a, i.e. if a[f] contributes to reducing αij/αii, it automatically in- creases αji/αjj . However, we require multiple features that contribute to reducing only αij without strengthen- ing αji that may only be possible in a high dimensional space requiring large norms of a. Yet, the norms ∥a∥2 are constrained by the parameter initialization and cannot in- crease arbitrarily due to the derived conservation law. Note that to switch off all neighborhood aggregation, we require αij/αii << 1, ∀ j ∈ N(i), further complicating the task. To address this challenge, we modify the GAT architecture by GATE that learns separate attention parameters for the node and the neighborhood contribution. As its conserva- tion law indicates, it can switch off neighborhood aggrega- tion in the well-trainable parameter regime. Theorem 4.3 (Structure of GATE gradients). The param- eters and gradients of a GATE network w.r.t. to loss L for layer l ∈ [L − 1] are conserved according to the following laws. Given Θ(θ) = ⟨θ, ∇θL⟩, it holds that: Θ(Wl [i,:]) − Θ(al+1 s [i]) − Θ(al+1 t [i]) = Θ(Wl+1 [:,i] ). (7) and, if additional independent matrices Ul and Vl are trainable, it also holds that: Θ(al s[i]) + Θ(al t[i]) = Θ(Ul [i,:]) + Θ(Vl [i,:]). (8) The proof is provided in the appendix. We utilize this the- orem for two purposes. Firstly, it induces an initialization that enables at least the initial trainability of the network. Similarly to GAT (Mustafa & Burkholz, 2023), we initial- ize all a parameters with zero and matrices W with ran- dom orthogonal looks-linear structure in GATE. This also ensures that we have no initial inductive bias or preference for specific neighbor or node features. As an ablation, we also verify that the initialization of the attention parameters in GAT with zero alone can not switch off neighborhood aggregation in GAT (see Fig. 7 in Appendix C). Secondly, the conservation law leads to the insight that a GATE network is more easily capable of switching off neighborhood aggregation or node feature contributions in comparison with GAT. Insight 4.4 (GATE is able to switch off neighborhood ag- gregation.). GATE can flexibly switch off neighborhood aggregation or node features in the well-trainable regime of the attention parameters. This insight follows immediately from the related conser- vation law for GATE that shows that at and as can inter- change the available budget for relative change among each other. Furthermore, the contribution of neighbors and the nodes are controlled separately. We show how the respec- tive switch-off can be achieved with relatively small atten- tion parameter norms that correspond to the well-trainable regime in Appendix A.3. To verify these insights in exper- iments, we next design synthetic data generators that can test the ability of GNNs to take structural infromation into account in a task-appropriate manner. 5. Experiments We validate the ability of GATE to perform the appropri- ate amount of neighborhood aggregation, as relevant for the given task and input graph, on both synthetic and real- world graphs. In order to gauge the amount of neighbor- hood aggregation, we study the distribution of αvv values (over the nodes) at various epochs during training and lay- ers in the network. This serves as a fair proxy since ∀ v ∈ V, αvv = 1 − P u∈N(v),u̸=v αuv. Thus, αvv = 1 implies no neighborhood aggregation (i.e. only hv is used) whereas αvv = 0 implies only neighborhood aggregation (i.e. hv is not used). Figure 2 shows an exemplary con- struction of both these cases. We defer a discussion of the experimental setup to Appendix B. 5.1. Synthetic Test Bed We construct the synthetic test bed as a node classification task for two types of problems: self-sufficient learning and neighbor-dependent learning. In the self-sufficient learning problem, complete label-relevant information is present in 4GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors (a) No neighborhood contribution required. (b) Only neighborhood contribution required. Figure 2: Examples of synthetic input graphs constructed for learning tasks that are (a) self-sufficient and can be bet- ter solved by switching off neighborhood aggregation, i.e. αvv = 1 and (b) neighbor-dependent that benefit from ig- noring the node’s own features, i.e.αvv = 0. In both cases, ∀ v ∈ V, P u∈N(v),u̸=v αuv + αvv = 1. These represent opposite ends of the spectrum whereas real-world tasks of- ten lie in between and require αii ∈ [0, 1]. GATE’s atten- tion mechanism is more flexible than GAT’s in learning the level of neighborhood aggregation required for a task. a node’s own features. On the contrary, in the neighbor- dependent learning problem, label-relevant information is present in the node features of the k-hop neighbors. We discuss both cases in detail, beginning with the simpler one. Learning self-sufficient node labels In order to model this task exactly, we generate an Erd ˝os–R´enyi (ER) graph structure G with N = 1000 nodes and edge probabil- ity p = 0 .01. Node labels yv are assigned uniformly at random from C = [2 , 8] classes. Input node features h0 v are generated as one-hot encoded node labels in both cases, i.e., h0 v = 1yv . Nodes are divided randomly into train/validation/test split with a 2 : 1 : 1 ratio. We also use a real-world graph structure of the Cora dataset. Two cases using this graph structure are tested: i) using the original node labels consisting of7 classes, and ii) randomized labels of 7 classes. Input node features are generated as one-hot encoding of node labels in both cases. The standard splits of Cora are used. Table 1: Self-sufficient learning: S, Cand L denote graph structure, number of label classes, and number of net- work layers, respectively. Original (Orig.) and randomized (Rand.) labels are used for the Cora structure. In all cases, 100% train accuracy is achieved except in ones marked with ∗ and GATE eventually achieves 100% test accuracy a few epochs later except in one marked with ‡. GAT S and GAT models marked with † also eventually achieve 100% test accuracy. GATE S behaves similarly to GATE and achieves 100% train and test accuracy. . S C L Test Acc.@Epoch of Min.

In line with the homophilic nature of Cora, GAT achieves reasonably good accuracy when the original labels of the Cora graph structure are used as neighborhood aggregation is relatively less detrimental, particularly in a single-layer model. Nevertheless, in the same case, GATE generalizes better than GAT with an increase in model depth. This in- dicates that over-smoothing, a major cause of performance degradation with model depth in GNNs, is also alleviated due to reduced neighborhood aggregations (see Fig. 3). On the contrary, random labels pose a real challenge to GAT. Since the neighborhood features are fully uninforma- tive about a node’s label in the randomized case, aggrega- tion over such a neighborhood distorts the fully informa- tive features of the node itself. This impedes the GAT net- work from learning the task, as it is unable to effectively switch off aggregation (see Fig. 3), whereas GATE is able to adapt to the required level of neighborhood aggregation (i.e. none, in this case). Interestingly, note that a single 5GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors (a) GAT with original labels  (b) GAT with random labels (c) GATE with original labels  (d) GATE with random labels Figure 3: Distribution of αvv against training epoch for self-sufficient learning problem using Cora structure and input node features as the one-hot encoding of labels for 1 and 2 layer models. Due to space limitation, we defer the plots of 5 layer networks to Fig. 8 in Appendix C. layer GAT in the case of random labels can almost, though not completely, switch off neighborhood aggregation (see Fig. 3) and achieve (near) perfect accuracy in the simpler cases. This is in line with our theoretical analysis (see In- sight 4.2), as the norms of a single-layer model are not con- strained and thus the attention parameters have more free- dom to change. Overall, the accuracy of GAT worsens drastically along two dimensions simultaneously: i) an increase in the depth of the model (due to increased unnecessary aggregation), and ii) an increase in the complexity of the task (due to an in- crease in the number of classes in an ER graph and conse- quently in node neighborhoods). In the interest of space, we defer results for GATE S to Fig. 9 in Appendix C as aggregation patterns similar to GATE are observed. Having established that GATE excels GAT in avoiding task-irrelevant neighborhood aggregation, it is also impor- tant to verify whether GATE can perform task-relevant neighborhood aggregation when required, and as much as required. We answer this question next by studying the be- havior of GATE, in comparison to GAT, on a synthetically constructed neighbor-dependent learning problem. Learning neighbor-dependent node labels To model this task, we generate an ER graph structure with N = 1000 nodes and edge probability p = 0 .01. Input node features h0 v ∈ Rd are sampled from a multivariate normal distribution N(0d, Id). For simplicity, d = 2. This input graph G is fed to a random GAT network Mk with k layers of width d. Note that this input graph G has no self-loops on nodes (i.e. v /∈ N(v)).The parameters of Mk are initialized with the standard Xavier (Glorot & Ben- gio, 2010) initialization. Thus, for each node v, the node embedding output by Mk, hMk v is effectively a function f Table 2: Neighbor-dependent learning: k and L denote the number of aggregation steps of the random GAT used for label generation and the number of layers of the evaluated network, respectively. Mean test accuracy ±95% confi- dence interval over 5 runs is reported. In all cases, a GATE variant outperforms the GAT variants. We further analyze one experimental run in detail in Table 8 in Appendix C. k L GATS GAT GATE S GATE 1 1 93 .6±1.3 92 .3±1.3 96.4 ± 0.7 93.5±1.3 2 93 .5±0.7 92 .7±2.7 97.9 ± 0.8 94.6±2.1 3 88 .2±4.9 91 .8±3.4 92 .1±4.6 94.0 ± 1.5 2 2 90 .4±1.3 87 .7±1.6 93.8 ± 0.5 88.7±2.5 3 82 .2±4.5 88 .9±2.1 85 .8±2.5 93.4 ± 3.3 4 84 .0±5.0 83 .0±4.8 89.2 ± 2.3 87.8±2.4 3 3 84 .3±3.2 83 .8±2.7 87 .5±1.8 88.6 ± 2.0 4 71 .4±3.9 75 .9±7.6 89.2 ± 1.0 89.0±0.5 5 80 .2±4.8 83 .9±2.2 86 .1±0.8 87.8 ± 1.6 of the k-hop neighboring nodes of node v represented by a random GAT network. Let Nk(v) denote the set of k-hop neighbors of v and v /∈ Nk(v). Finally, we run K-means clustering on the neighborhood aggregated representation of nodes hMk v to divide nodes into C clusters. For simplicity, we set C = 2. This cluster- ing serves as the node labels (i.e. yv = argc∈[C](v ∈ c) for our node classification task. Thus, the label yv of a node v to be learned is highly dependent on the input features of the neighboring nodes h0 u ∈ Nk(v) rather than the node’s own input features h0 v. The generated input data and the real decision boundary for varying k are shown in Fig. 4. Corresponding results in Table 2 and Fig. 5 exhibit that GATE can better detect the amount of necessary neighborhood aggregation than GAT. However, this task is more challenging than the previous one, and GATE too can not achieve perfect100% test accu- racy. This could be attributed to data points close to the real decision boundary which is not crisply defined (see Fig. 4). 5.2. Real-World Data To demonstrate that the ability of GATE to switch-off neighborhood aggregation has real application relevance, we evaluate GATE on relatively large-scale real-world node classification tasks, namely on five heterophilic benchmark datasets (Platonov et al., 2023) (see Table 3) and three OGB datasets (Hu et al., 2021) (see Table 5). We defer results and discussion on five small-scale datasets with varying homophily levels to Table 7 in Appendix C.

Columns (left to right): 3, 4, and 5 layer models. While GAT is unable to switch off neighborhood aggregation in any layer, only 3 layers of the 4 and 5 layer models perform neighborhood aggregation. the potential benefits of combining MLP and GAT layers in GATE, we compare its behavior with GAT and MLP. We argue that the better performance of GATE, by a large margin in most cases, can be attributed to down-weighting unrelated neighbors, leveraging deeper non-linear feature transformations, and reducing over-smoothing. While we focus our exposition on the neighborhood aggre- gation perspective of GATs, we also consider the FAGCN architecture (Bo et al., 2021), which relies on a similar at- tention mechanism and, in theory, could switch off neigh- borhood aggregation when positive and negative contribu- tions of neighbors cancel out. In contrast to GATE, it re- quires tuning a hyperparameter ϵ, which controls the con- tribution of raw node features to each layer. Furthermore, on our synthetic tasks, we find that, like GAT, FAGCN is also unable to limit neighborhood contribution. We also provide a detailed qualitative and quantitative discussion comparing GATE and FAGCN using the synthetic testbed in Appendix C. Next, we analyze GATE’s ability to mix MLP and GAT layers. To this end, we evaluate a GNN architecture con- structed by alternately placing GAT and MLP layers in the network that we denote by MLP +GAT on various het- erophilic tasks. The purpose of this experiment is twofold. Firstly, we observe in Table 3 that MLP+GAT outperforms both GAT and MLP in most cases. This highlights the benefit of only performing non-linear transformations on raw or aggregated neighborhood features without immedi- ate further neighborhood aggregation to learn potentially more complex features. Secondly, we find GATE to outper- form MLP+GAT (see Table 3). This illustrates that rigidly embedding MLP layers in a GNN with arbitrary predefined roles is not ideal as the appropriate degree and placement of neighborhood aggregation is unknown a-priori. In con- trast, GATE offers more flexibility to learn intricate com- binations of GNN layers and nonlinear feature transforma- tions that define more adequate models for a given task, as exemplified in Fig. 6. The distributions ofαvv in Fig. 6 across layers in GATE re- veal information about the relative importance of node fea- ture and graph structure at the node level, which allows us to analyze the question to which degree graph information is helpful for a task. For example, in Fig. 6, we observe that the αvv values are mostly lower in the minesweeper dataset than the roman-empire dataset. This indicates that aggregation, particularly over the input node features and the final layer’s learned representations, is more beneficial compared to the node’s own features for the minesweeper dataset. On the other hand, for roman-empire, the model has a higher preference to utilize features of the node it- self (as most values of αvv approach 1) over features of the neighbors. This aligns with the homophily levels, 0.05 and 0.68, of the roman-empire and minesweeper datasets, re- spectively. A similar analysis for datasets Texas and Actor can be found in Fig. 13 in Appendix C. We also observe in Fig. 6 that when neighborhood aggrega- 7GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors Table 3: We report mean test accuracy ±95% confidence interval for roman-empire and amazon-ratings and AUC-ROC for the other three datasets over the standard 10 splits, following (Platonov et al., 2023). All architectures were run with networks of depth 5 and 10 layers. The better performance for each architecture is shown with the number of network layers used in parentheses.

Figure 6: Distribution of αvv against training epoch for a run of 5 layer networks on real-world heterophilic tasks. As ex- pected, GAT is unable to significantly vary neighborhood aggregation whereas GATE exhibits varying aggregation patterns across layers and tasks. These could be interpreted to indicate the inherent importance of raw node features relative to their neighborhoods for a given task. We defer the plots of the 10-layer models for tolokers dataset to Fig. 11 in Appendix C. tion takes place, the level of aggregation across all nodes, as indicated by the shape of αvv distribution, varies over network layers. This is expected as different nodes need different levels of aggregation depending on where they are situated in the graph topology. For example, peripheral nodes would require more aggregation than central nodes to obtain a similar amount of information. Therefore, as already observed with purposefully constructed synthetic data, GATE offers a more interpretable model than GAT in a real-world setting. While we focus our evaluation in Table 3 on comparison with the most relevant baselines such as attention-based ar- chitectures, we next present a more extensive comparison with 14 other baseline architectures in Table 4. For the re- sults reported in Table 3, we conduct experiments in a sim- ple setting without additional elements that may impact the performance such as skip connections, normalization, etc., to isolate the effect of the architecture and evaluate solely the impact of GATE’s ability to switch off neighborhood aggregation on real-world data. However, for the results in Table 4, we adopt the original codebase of (Platonov et al., 2023), which utilizes such elements to evaluate the performance of baseline GNNs and architectures specifi- cally designed for heterophilic datasets. We evaluate GATE in the same settings optimized for their experiments. For easy comparison, we replicate their results from Table 4 in (Platonov et al., 2023). We observe in Table 4 that while GATE outperforms GAT (and other baselines) significantly, GATE has comparable performance to GAT-sep, a variant of GAT, despite GATE being more parameter efficient by an order of magnitude. More specifically, GAT-sep and GATE introduce d2 and d additional parameters, respectively, in a layer. By corre- spondingly adapting GATE, we find GATE-sep to achieve the best performance in most cases. Therefore, additional techniques generally employed to boost performance are compatible and complementary to GATE. GATE’s ability to benefit from depth in terms of generaliza- tion is demonstrated on OGB datasets (see Table 5).

While the better performance of deeper models with limited neighborhood aggregation in certain layers indi- cates reduced over-smoothing, we also verify this insight quantitatively (see Table 9 in Appendix C). Our experimental code is available at https:// github.com/RelationalML/GATE.git. 6. Conclusion We experimentally illustrate a structural limitation of GAT that disables the architecture, in practice, to switch off task- irrelevant neighborhood aggregation. This obstructs GAT from achieving its intended potential. Based on insights from an existing conservation law of gradient flow dynam- ics in GAT, we have explained the source of this problem. To verify that we have identified the correct issue, we re- solve it with a modification of GAT, which we call GATE, and derive the corresponding modified conservation law. GATE holds multiple advantages over GAT, as it can lever- age the benefits of depth as in MLPs, offer interpretable, learned self-attention coefficients, and adapt the model to the necessary degree of neighborhood aggregation for a given task. We verify this on multiple synthetic and real- world tasks, where GATE significantly outperforms GAT and also achieves a new SOTA test accuracy on the OGB- arxiv dataset. Therefore, we argue that GATE is a suitable candidate to answer highly debated questions related to the importance of a given graph structure for standard tasks. 9GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors Acknowledgements We gratefully acknowledge funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the Horizon Europe Framework Programme (HORIZON) for proposal number 101116395 SPARSE-ML.

GATs are challenged to switch off neighborhood aggregation during training, as this would require the model to enter a less trainable regime with large attention parameters ∥a∥2 >> 1. We have to distinguish GATs with and without weight sharing in our analysis. GATs with weight sharing: To investigate the ability of a GAT to switch off neighborhood aggregation, let us focus on a link(i, j) that should neither contribute to the feature transformation of i nor j. This implies that we need to find attention parameters a (and potentially feature transformations W) so that αij/αii << 1 with αij/αii = exp ( eij − eii). This implies that we require eij − eii << 0 and thus aT ϕ (W (hi + hj)) − 2aT ϕ (W (hi)) << 0. Since we also require αij/αjj << 1, it follows from adding both inequalities that aT [ϕ (W (hi + hj)) − (ϕ (Whi) + ϕ (Whj))] << 0. This inequality can only be fulfilled if there exists at least one feature f for which ∆fij ; = a[f] [ϕ (W[f, :] (hi + hj)) − (ϕ (W[f, :]hi) + ϕ (W[f, :]hi))] fulfills ∆fij << 0. Yet, note that if both ϕ (W[f, :]hi) and ϕ (W[f, :]hj) are positive or both are negative, we just get ∆fij = 0 because of the definition of a LeakyReLU. Thus, there must exist at least one feature f so that without loss of generality ϕ (W[f, :]hi) < 0 and ϕ (W[f, :]hj) > 0. It follows that if a[f] > 0 that 0 > a[f]ϕ (W[f, :]hi) >> a[f] (ϕ (W[f, :] (hi + hj)) − ϕ (W[f, :]hj)) > a[f] (ϕ (W[f, :] (hi + hj)) − 2ϕ (W[f, :]hj)) also receives a negative contribution that makes αij/αjj smaller. Yet, what happens to αij/αii? By distinguishing two cases, namely W[f, :] (hi + hj) > 0 or W[f, :] (hi + hj) < 0 and computing a[f] [ϕ (W (hi + hj)) − 2ϕ (W[f, :]hj)] > 0 we find the feature contribution to be positive. If a[f] < 0, then 0 > a[f]ϕ (W[f, :]hj) >> a[f] (ϕ (W[f, :] (hi + hj)) − ϕ (W[f, :]hi)) > a[f] (ϕ (W[f, :] (hi + hj)) − 2ϕ (W[f, :]hi)) and αij/αjj is reduced. Similarly, we can derive that at the same time αij/αii is increased, however. This implies that any feature that contributes to reducing ∆fij automatically increases one feature while it increases another. We therefore need multiple featuresf to contribute to reducing either αij/αii or αij/αjj to compensate for other increases. This implies, in order to switch off neighborhood aggregation, we would need a high dimensional space of features that cater to switching off specific links without strengthening others. Furthermore, they would need large absolute values of a[f] and norms of W[f, :] or exploding feature vectors h to achieve this. Yet, all these norms are constrained by the derived conservation law and therefore prevent learning a representation that switches off full neighborhoods. GATs without weight sharing: The flow of argumentation without weight sharing is very similar to the one above with weight sharing. Yet, we have to distinguish more cases. 13GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors Similarly to before, we require αij/αjj << 1 and αji/αii << 1. It follows from adding both related inequalities that aT [ϕ (Wshi + Wthj) + ϕ (Wshj + Wthi) − ϕ ((Ws + Wt) hi) − ϕ ((Ws + Wt) hj)] << 0. This implies that for at least one feature f, we require a[f][ϕ \u0000 Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj \u0001 + ϕ \u0000 Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi \u0001 − ϕ ((Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hi) − ϕ ((Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj)] << 0. (9) Again, our goal is to show that this feature automatically decreases the contribution of one feature while it increases another. As argued above, switching off neighborhood aggregation would therefore need a high dimensional space of features that cater to switching off specific links without strengthening others. Furthermore, they would need large absolute values of a[f] and norms of W[f, :] or exploding feature vectors h to achieve this. Our derived norm constraints, however, prevent learning such a model representation. Concretely, without loss of generality, we therefore have to show that if a[f][ϕ \u0000 Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj \u0001 − ϕ \u0000\u0000 Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :] \u0001 hj \u0001 < 0, (10) at the same time, we receive a[f][ϕ \u0000 Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi \u0001 − ϕ \u0000\u0000 Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :] \u0001 hi \u0001 > 0, (11) (or vice versa). In principle, we have to show this for 16 different cases of pre-activation sign configurations for the four terms in Eq. (9). Yet, since the argument is symmetric with respect to exchanging i and j, only 8 different cases remain. Two trivial cases are identical signs for all four terms. These are excluded, as the left hand side (LHS) of Eq. (9) would become zero and thus not contribute to our goal to switch off neighborhood aggregation. In the following, we will discuss the remaining six cases. Please note that for the remainder of this derivation α >0 denotes the slope of the leakyReLU and not the attention weights αij. 1. Case (+ − ++): Let us assume that Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj > 0, Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi < 0, (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hi > 0, and (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj > 0. From this assumption and the fact that ϕ is a leakyReLU it follows that the LHS of Eq. (9) be- comes: a[f][ϕ \u0000 Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj \u0001 + ϕ \u0000 Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi \u0001 − ϕ \u0000\u0000 Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :] \u0001 hi \u0001 − ϕ \u0000\u0000 Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :] \u0001 hj \u0001 ] = a[f](α −1)[Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi]. Since α −1 < 0 and [Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, : ]hi] < 0 according to our assumption, Eq. (9) demands a[f] < 0. To switch off neighborhood aggregation, we would need to be able to make the LHS of Eq. (10) and Eq. (11) Eq. (11) negative. Yet, a negative a[f] leads to a positive LHS of Eq. (11). Thus, the assumed sign configuration cannot support switching off neighborhood aggregation. 2. Case (+ − −−): Let us assume that Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj > 0, Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi < 0, (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hi < 0, and (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj < 0. The LHS of Eq. (9) becomes a[f](1 −α)[Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj], which demands a[f] < 0. Accordingly, the LHS of Eq. (10) is clearly negative, while the LHS of Eq. (11) is a[f]αWs[f, :](hj − hi) > 0. The last inequality follows from our assumptions that implyWs[f, :]hj < Ws[f, :]hi by combining the assumptions (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj < 0 and Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj > 0. Again, this result implies that the considered sign configuration does not support switching off neighborhood aggregation. 3. Case (+ + + −): Let us assume that Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj > 0, Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi > 0, (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hi > 0, and (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj < 0. The LHS of Eq. (9) becomes a[f](1 −α)[Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hj], which demands a[f] > 0. Accordingly, the LHS of Eq. (10) becomes positive, which hampers switching-off neighborhood aggregation as discussed. 14GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors 4. Case (− − −+): Let us assume that Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj < 0, Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi < 0, (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hi < 0, and (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj > 0. The LHS of Eq. (9) becomes a[f](α −1)[Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hj], which demands a[f] > 0. Accordingly, the LHS of Eq. (10) becomes clearly negative. However, the LHS of Eq. (11) is positive, asa[f]αWs[f, :](hj − hi) > 0. The last inequality follows from our assumptions that imply Ws[f, :]hj > Ws[f, :]hi by combining the assumptions (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj > 0 and Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj < 0. Again, this analysis implies that the considered sign configuration does not support switching off neighborhood aggregation. 5. Case (+ − +−): Let us assume that Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj > 0, Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi < 0, (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hi > 0, and (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj < 0. According to our assumptions the LHS of Eq. (10) can only be negative if a[f] < 0. Yet, the LHS of Eq. (11) can only be negative if a[f] > 0. Thus, this case clearly cannot contribute to switching off neighborhood aggregation. 6. Case (+ − −+): Let us assume that Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj > 0, Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi < 0, (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hi < 0, and (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj > 0. Eq. (9) becomes a[f](1 − α)Ws[f, :] (hi − hj) < 0. At the same time, the LHS of Eq. (10) simplifies to a[f]Ws[f, : ](hi − hj) and the LHS of Eq. (11) is a[f]αWs[f, :](hj − hi) > 0. Hence, a negative Eq. (9) leads to a positive Eq. (11). Accordingly, the last possible sign configuration also does not support switching off neighborhood aggregation, which concludes our derivation. A.2. Proof of Theorem 4.3 Statement (Restated Theorem 4.3). The gradients and parameters of GATE for layer l ∈ [L − 1] are conserved according to the following laws: ⟨Wl[i, :], ∇Wl[i,:]L⟩ = ⟨Wl+1[:, i], ∇Wl+1[:,i]L⟩ + ⟨al+1 s [i], ∇al+1 s [i]L⟩ + ⟨al+1 t [i], ∇al+1 t [i]L⟩. (12) and, if additional independent matrices Ul and Vl are trainable, it also holds ⟨al s[i], ∇als[i]L⟩ + ⟨al t[i], ∇al t[i]L⟩ = ⟨Ul[i, :], ∇Ul[i,:]L⟩ + ⟨V l[i, :], ∇V l[i,:]L⟩. (13) The proof is analogous to the derivation of Theorem 2.2 by (Mustafa & Burkholz, 2023) that is restated in this work as Theorem 4.1. For ease, we replicate their notation and definitions here. Statement (Rescale invariance: Def 5.1 by Mustafa & Burkholz (2023)). The loss L(θ) is rescale-invariant with respect to disjoint subsets of the parametersθ1 and θ2 if for everyλ >0 we haveL(θ) = L((λθ1, λ−1θ2, θd)), where θ = (θ1, θ2, θd). Statement (Gradient structure due to rescale invariance Lemma 5.2 in (Mustafa & Burkholz, 2023)). The rescale invariance of L enforces the following geometric constraint on the gradients of the loss with respect to its parameters: ⟨θ1, ∇θ1L⟩ − ⟨θ2, ∇θ2L⟩ = 0. (14) We first consider the simpler case of GATES, i.e. W = U = V Theorem A.1 (Structure of GATES gradients). The gradients and parameters of GATES for layer l ∈ [L−1] are conserved according to the following laws: ⟨Wl[i, :], ∇Wl[i,:]L⟩ = ⟨Wl+1[:, i], ∇Wl+1[:,i]L⟩ + ⟨al s[i], ∇als[i]L⟩ + ⟨al t[i], ∇al t[i]L⟩. (15) Following a similar strategy to (Mustafa & Burkholz, 2023), we identify rescale invariances for every neuron i at layer l that induce the stated gradient structure. Given the following definition of disjoint subsets θ1 and θ2 of the parameter set θ, associated with neuron i in layer l, 15GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors θ1 = {x|x ∈ Wl[i, :]} θ2 = {w|w ∈ Wl+1[:, i]} ∪ {al s[i]} ∪ {al t[i]} We show that the loss of GATES remains invariant for any λ >0. The only components of the network that potentially change under rescaling are hl u[i], hl+1 v [j], and αl uv. The scaled network parameters are denoted with a tilde as ˜as l[i] = λ−1al s[i], ˜at l[i] = λ−1al t[i], and ˜Wl[i, j] = λWl[i, j], and the corresponding networks components scaled as a result are denoted by ˜hl u[i], ˜hl+1 v [k], and ˜αl uv. We show that the parameters of upper layers remain unaffected, as ˜hl+1 v [k] coincides with its original non-scaled variant ˜hl+1 v [k] = hl+1 v [k]. Also recall Eq. (4) for W = U = V as: el uv = ((1 − quv)al s + (quv)al t)⊤ · ϕ(Wlhl−1 u + Wlhl−1 v ) where quv = 1 if u = v and quv = 0 if u ̸= v. For simplicity, we rewrite this as: el uv,u̸=v = (al s)⊤ · ϕ(Wlhl−1 u + Wlhl−1 v ) (16) el uv,u=v = (al t)⊤ · ϕ(Wlhl−1 u + Wlhl−1 v ) (17) We show that ˜αl uv = exp(˜el uv)P u′∈N(v) exp(˜eluv) = αl uv , because (18) ˜el uv,u̸=v = el uv,u̸=v , and ˜el uv,u=v = el uv,u=v (19) which follows from the positive homogeneity of ϕ that allows ˜el uv,u=v = λ−1al s[i]ϕ( nl−1X j λWl[i, j](hl−1 u [j] + hl−1 v [j]) + nlX i′̸=i al s[i′]ϕ( nl−1X j Wl[i′, j](hl−1 u [j] + hl−1 v [j]) (20) = λ−1λal s[i]ϕ( nl−1X j Wl[i, j](hl−1 u [j] + hl−1 v [j]) + nlX i′̸=i al s[i′]ϕ( nl−1X j Wl[i′, j](hl−1 u [j] + hl−1 v [j]) (21) = el uv,u̸=v. (22) and similarly, 16GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors ˜el uv,u=v = λ−1al t[i]ϕ( nl−1X j λWl[i, j](hl−1 u [j] + hl−1 v [j]) + nlX i′̸=i al t[i′]ϕ( nl−1X j Wl[i′, j](hl−1 u [j] + hl−1 v [j]) (23) = λ−1λal t[i]ϕ( nl−1X j Wl[i, j](hl−1 u [j] + hl−1 v [j]) + nlX i′̸=i al t[i′]ϕ( nl−1X j Wl[i′, j](hl−1 u [j] + hl−1 v [j]) (24) = el uv,u=v. (25) Since ˜αl uv = αl uv, it follows that ˜hu l [i] = ϕ1   X z∈N(u) αl zu nl−1X j λWl[i, j]hl−1 z [j]   = λϕ1   X z∈N(u) αl zu nl−1X j Wl[i, j]hl−1 z [j]   = λhl u[i]. In the next layer, we therefore have ˜hl+1 v [k] = ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i λ−1Wl+1[k, i]˜hl u[i]   = ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i λ−1Wl+1[k, i]λhl u[i]   = ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i Wl+1[k, i]hl u[i]   = hl+1 v [k]. Thus, the output node representations of the network remain unchanged, and the loss L is rescale-invariant. Next consider the case that Wl, Ul, and V l are independent matrices. Similarly to the previous reasoning, we see that if we scale ˜Wl[i, :] = Wl[i, :]λ, then also scaling ˜Wl+1[:, i] = Wl+1[:, i]λ−1 and ˜al+1 s [i] = al+1 s [i]λ−1 and ˜al+1 t [i] = al+1 t [i]λ−1 will keep the GATE layer unaltered. In this case, we obtain an additional rescaling relationship between al s, al t and Ul, V l. A rescaling of the form ˜as l[i] = λ−1al s[i], ˜at l[i] = λ−1al t[i] could be compensated by ˜Ul[i, :] = Ul[i, :]λ and ˜V l[i, :] = V l[i, :]λ. It follows immediately that ˜euv = euv. A.3. Derivation of Insight 4.4 Following the analysis in A.1, in contrast to GAT, αij/αii << 1 can be easily realized in GATE with as[f] < 0 and at[f] > 0 for all or only a subset of the features. Note that for the non-weight-sharing case, U and V in GATE would simply correspond to Ws and Wt, respectively, in GATE and the same line of reasoning holds. Large norms are usually not required to create a notable difference in size between eii and eij. 17GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors B. Experimental Settings Our complete experimental setup is described as follows. Non-linearity For GATS and GAT networks, we substitute ϕ in Eq. (3) with LeakyReLU as defined in the standard architecture. For GATE, we substitute ϕ in Eq. (4) with ReLU in order to be able to interpret the sign of as and at parameters as contributing positively or negatively to neighborhood aggregation. MLP, MLP +GAT , and FAGCN also all use ReLU after every hidden layer. Network Width We vary the depth of GAT and GATE networks in all our experiments as specified. For synthetic datasets, the network width is fixed to 64 in all cases. For OGB datasets, we use the hidden dimensions used by (Brody et al., 2022). For the remaining datasets, the network width is also fixed to 64. Initialization The feature transformation parameter matrices, i.e.,W, U, and V are initialized randomly with an orthog- onal looks-linear structure (Burkholz & Dubatovka, 2019) for MLP, MLP+GAT , GAT(S) and GATE(S). The parameters a in GAT(S) use Xavier initialization (Glorot & Bengio, 2010), as is the standard. In GATE(S), as and at are initialized to 0 to initially give equal weights to the features of a node itself and its neighboring nodes. Optimization Synthetic, OGB, and remaining real-world tasks are run for a maximum of 10000, 2000, 5000 epochs, respectively, using the Adam optimizer. To isolate the effect of the architecture and study the parameter dynamics during training as best as possible, we do not use any additional elements such as weight decay and dropout regularization. We also do not perform any hyperparameter optimization. However, the learning rate is adjusted for different real-world datasets to enable stable training of models as specified in Table 6. Nevertheless, for a fair comparison, the same learning rate is used for a given problem across all architectures. For all synthetic data, a learning rate of 0.005 is used. Real-world datasets use their standard train/test/validation splits, i.e. those provided by Pytorch Geometric for Planetoid datasets Cora and Citeseer, by OGB framework for OGB datasets, and by (Platonov et al., 2023) for all remaining real-world datasets.

Additional Results Smaller Real-World Datasets We evaluate GAT and GATE on five small-scale real-world datasets with varying ho- mophily levels β as defined in (Pei et al., 2020) and report results in Table 7. Higher values ofβ indicate higher homophily, i.e. similar nodes (with the same label) tend to be connected. We note that a 2-layer network of a baseline method for het- erophilic datasets, Geom-GCN (Pei et al., 2020), attains test accuracy (%) of64.1, 67.6, and 31.6 for Wisconsin, Texas, and Actor datasets, respectively, which is in line with that achieved by GATE. Except for Citeseer, the best overall performance for each dataset is achieved on a shallow model. This is not surprising as these datasets are small-scale and potentially prone to over-fitting in large models, particularly since we do not use any skip connections or regularization to retain model performance. Furthermore, the three heterophilic datasets have been recently shown to be problematic (Platonov et al., 2023). Therefore, a better evaluation of GATE is on relatively large-scale OGB datasets (Hu et al., 2021) and more recent heterophilic datasets (Platonov et al., 2023) that can exploit the flexibility of GATE. Although GATE is more pa- rameterized than GAT, it usually requires fewer training epochs and generalizes better, in addition to other advantages over GAT as discussed in the paper.

However, we also run the GAT model for 15000 epochs for this case, and it achieves 85.9% test accuracy at epoch 47 where the model achieves 100% accuracy and only achieves a maximum test accuracy of 89.3% briefly at epoch 8. 20GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors Figure 10: Distribution of αvv against training epoch for the neighbor-dependent learning problem withk = 1.

This provides an insight into how similar the function represented by the trained model is to the function used to generate node labels, i.e. whether the model is simply overfitting to the train data or really learning the task. Higher training and test accuracy simultaneously indicate better learning. In this regard, the difference in train accuracy at max. test accuracy between GATE and GATS or GAT is only 0.4, 1.0 and 0.6 for the settings (k = 1, L= 3), (k = 2, L= 4) and (k = 3, L= 3), respectively. k L Test Acc. @ Epoch of Max.

Figure 12: Distribution of αvv against training epoch of 2-layer (left) and 5-layer (right) GAT networks for heterophilic datasets Texas (top) and Actor (bottom) 2-layer modes. Despite having connections to unrelated neighbors, GAT is unable to switch off neighborhood aggregation. Figure 13: Distribution of αvv, against training epoch of 2-layer (left) and 5-layer (right) GATE networks for heterophilic datasets Texas (top) and Actor (bottom), across layers could be interpreted to indicate the inherent importance of raw node features relative to their neighborhoods. For instance, in the case of Texas, GATE carries out little to no neighborhood aggregation in the first layer over input node features. Instead, aggregation is mainly done over node features transformed in earlier layers that effectuate non-linear feature learning as in perceptrons. However, in the case of Actor, GATE prefers most of the neighborhood aggregation to occur over the input node features, indicating that they are more informative for the task at hand. 22GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors Over-smoothing analysis In the main paper, we have already established the superior performance of GATE, compared to GAT, on several tasks. Intuitively, this can partially be attributed to reduced over-smoothing as its root cause, unnecessary neighborhood aggregation, is alleviated. Here, we verify this insight quantitatively. A widely accepted measure of over-smoothing is the Dirichlet energy (DE) (Cai & Wang, 2020). However, Eliasof et al. (2023) propose a modification of DE to measure GAT energy EGAT , that we use to evaluate over-smoothing in our experiments (see Table 9). We note that the notion of ‘over-smoothing’ is itself task-dependent. It is difficult to determine the optimal degree of smoothing for a task and the threshold that determines ‘over’-smoothing. This merits an in-depth analysis and curation of task-dependent smoothness measures that are not our focus. To show that GATE reduced over- smoothing relative to GAT, it suffices that a decrease in smoothing and an increase in accuracy occur simultaneously. Table 9: The measures Einput, EGAT and EGATE denote the smoothness of input node features, node features at the last layer L of the trained GAT and GATE models, respectively. Two cases are considered: All node pairs and only adjacent node pairs to measure smoothing at the global graph and local node level. Higher values indicate less smoothing. Node representations learned by GATE achieve higher test accuracy on all these tasks, as reported in the main paper, and are simultaneously less smooth than GAT in most cases, indicating that GATE potentially alleviates over-smoothing in GATs.

However, they are less flexible in assigning different importance to neighbors, suffer from over-smoothing, or come at the cost of an increased parameter count by increasing the size of the hidden dimensions (e.g. via a concatena- tion operation). We evaluate the performance of three such architectures that, in principle, employ different aggregation methods, which are likely to be capable of switching off neighborhood aggregation, on synthetic datasets empirically and discuss their ability or inability to switch off neighborhood aggregation qualitatively as follows. 1. ωGAT (Eliasof et al., 2023) introduces an additional feature-wise layer parameter ω that can, in principle, switch off neighborhood aggregation by setting ω parameters to 0, in addition to the attention mechanism based on GAT. How- ever, in practice, as we verify on our synthetic dataset in Figure 14, it is unable to effectively switch off neighborhood aggregation. Although it outperforms GAT, it is still substantially worse than GATE, especially for the deeper model due to unnecessary neighborhood aggregations. Another architecture based on graph attention, superGAT(Kim & Oh, 2021), falls under the paradigm of structural learning as it uses a self-supervised attention mechanism essentially for link prediction between nodes, and therefore its comparison with GATE is infeasible. 2. GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2018) uses the concatenation operation to combine the node’s own representation with the aggregated neighborhood representation. Therefore, it is usually (but not always) able to switch off the neigh- borhood aggregation for the synthetic datasets designed for the self-sufficient learning task (see Table 10). Mostly, GATE performs better on the neighbor-dependent task, in particular for deeper models, where the performance of GraphSAGE drops likely due to over-smoothing (see Table 11). 3. FAGCN (Bo et al., 2021) requires a slightly more detailed analysis. Authors of FAGCN state in the paper that: ‘When αG ij ≈ 0, the contributions of neighbors will be limited, so the raw features will dominate the node representations.’ where αG ij defined in the paper can be considered analogous to αij in GAT, though they are defined differently. Thus, from an expressivity point of view, FAGCN should be able to assign parameters such that all αG ij = 0. However, we empirically observe on synthetic datasets designed for the self-sufficient learning task, values of αG ij do not, in fact, approach zero. Despite being unable to switch off neighborhood aggregation, FAGCN, in its default implementation, achieves 100% test accuracy on the task. We discover this is so because FAGCN introduces direct skip connections of non-linearly transformed raw node features to every hidden layer. Given the simplicity of the one-hot encoded features in the datasets and the complete dependence of the label on these features, FAGCN is able to represent the desired function. In order to better judge its ability to switch off neighborhood aggregation by setting αG ij = 0, we remove this skip connection. From an expressivity point of view, FAGCN should still be able to achieve 100% test accuracy by using only the (non-)linear transformations of raw features initially and performing no neighborhood aggregation in the hidden layers. However, we find that FAGCN was unable to emulate this behavior in practice. For a fair comparison of the differently designed attention mechanism in FAGCN with GATE, we introduce self-loops in the data so FAGCN may also receive a node’s own features in every hidden layer. Even then, FAGCN fails to achieve perfect test accuracy as shown in Table 10. Therefore, we suspect the attention mechanism in FAGCN may also be susceptible to the trainability issues we have identified for the attention mechanism in GAT. Nevertheless, the capacity of FAGCN to learn negative associations with neighboring nodes is complementary to GATE and both could be combined. It would be interesting to derive conservation laws inherent to other architectures such as FAGCN and GraphSAGE and study how they govern the behaviour of parameters. Furthermore, by design, FAGCN does not perform any non-linear transformations of aggregated neighborhood features which may be necessary in some tasks, such as our synthetic dataset for the neighbor-dependent learning task. As Table 11 shows, GATE outperforms FAGCN on such a task. Lastly, we would like to emphasize that our aim is to provide insights into the attention mechanism of GAT and understand its limitations. While it should be able to flexibly assign importance to neighbors and the node itself without the need for concatenated representation or explicit skip connections of the raw features to every layer, it is currently unable to do so in practice. In order to verify our identification of trainability issues, we modify the GAT architecture to enable the trainability of attention parameters which control the trade-off between node features and structural information. 24GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors Figure 14: Distribution of αvv against training epoch for self-sufficient learning problem using the Cora structure with random labels, where input node features are a one-hot encoding of node labels, for theωGAT architecture for the1, 2 and 5 layer models that achieve test accuracy of 100%, 98.5%, and 49.3%, respectively.

        "main_contributions": "The paper identifies and experimentally demonstrates a structural limitation of Graph Attention Networks (GATs): their inability to switch off task-irrelevant neighborhood aggregation, leading to over-smoothing and hindering the benefits of deeper models. To address this, the authors propose GATE, a GAT extension that alleviates over-smoothing, benefits from increased model depth for non-linear feature transformations, and often outperforms GATs on real-world heterophilic datasets. GATE also offers interpretable learned self-attention coefficients and achieves a new state-of-the-art test accuracy on the OGB-arxiv dataset (79.57 ± 0.84%). Additionally, the work introduces a synthetic test bed for analyzing adaptive neighborhood aggregation and updates an existing conservation law related to GAT gradients to explain GATE's behavior.",
        "methodology": "The core methodology involves modifying the GAT architecture based on theoretical insights from gradient flow dynamics and conservation laws. The paper first provides an intuitive and theoretical explanation for GAT's limitation, rooted in norm constraints imposed by its conservation law, which prevents attention parameters from entering a regime required to switch off aggregation. GATE modifies the GAT attention mechanism (specifically, the `e_uv` calculation from Eq. 3 to Eq. 4) by introducing separate attention parameters for the node's own features (`a_t`) and its neighboring nodes' features (`a_s`). This allows GATE to flexibly and independently weigh the importance of node features versus neighborhood features. A new conservation law for GATE is derived (Theorem 4.3), showing that `a_s` and `a_t` can interchange their budget for relative change, enabling neighborhood aggregation to be switched on or off in a well-trainable parameter regime. ReLU is used as the non-linear activation function in GATE to allow for direct interpretation of the signs of `a_s` and `a_t` as contributing positively or negatively.",
        "experimental_setup": "The validation of GATE's capabilities was conducted on both synthetic and real-world graphs. The synthetic test bed included two node classification problems: 1) 'Self-sufficient learning,' where label-relevant information is entirely within a node's own features, modeled using Erdős–Rényi (ER) graphs (N=1000, p=0.01) with one-hot encoded labels and the Cora dataset with original/randomized labels. 2) 'Neighbor-dependent learning,' where label-relevant information is in k-hop neighbors' features, modeled using ER graphs with node features from a multivariate normal distribution and labels derived from K-means clustering on k-hop aggregated features. Real-world datasets included five heterophilic benchmarks (roman-empire, amazon-ratings, questions, minesweeper, tolokers) and three OGB datasets (OGB-arxiv, OGB-products, OGB-mag). Smaller real-world datasets (Cora, Citeseer, Actor, Texas, Wisconsin) were also used for supplementary results. Models were trained using the Adam optimizer for up to 10,000 (synthetic), 2,000 (OGB), or 5,000 (other real-world) epochs. Initial comparisons (Table 3) were done without weight decay or dropout to isolate architectural effects, while a broader comparison (Table 4) adopted the experimental setup of Platonov et al. (2023), including such elements. Evaluation metrics included test accuracy and AUC-ROC, with over-smoothing assessed using Dirichlet energy and modified GAT energy (EGAT). Initialization involved orthogonal looks-linear structure for feature transformation matrices and Xavier for GAT attention parameters, while GATE's `a_s` and `a_t` were initialized to zero.",
        "limitations": "The paper notes that GATE, while significantly outperforming GAT, could not achieve perfect 100% test accuracy on the neighbor-dependent synthetic task, attributed to data points near a 'not crisply defined' decision boundary. For small-scale datasets, it was observed that shallower models performed better, and deeper models were prone to overfitting, particularly in the absence of additional elements like skip connections or regularization (which were intentionally omitted in some comparative experiments to isolate architectural effects). The authors also acknowledge that the notion of 'over-smoothing' itself is task-dependent and difficult to precisely quantify with an optimal threshold. Furthermore, while GATE is more parameter-efficient than GAT-sep, comparable or sometimes better performance was achieved by GAT-sep and a GATE variant called GATE-sep, indicating that other techniques like separate transformations for source/target nodes are complementary and can boost performance.",
        "future_research_directions": "The paper suggests that GATE is a suitable candidate for future research aiming to answer highly debated questions regarding the importance of a given graph structure for standard tasks. Specific directions include deriving conservation laws inherent to other GNN architectures, such as FAGCN and GraphSAGE, to better understand their parameter behavior. Additionally, the authors propose combining GATE with complementary methods like graph rewiring (e.g., to mitigate over-squashing issues) and further developing and curating task-dependent smoothness measures, given the inherent task-dependency of the 'over-smoothing' concept."

For instance, graph neural networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on learning tasks such as node classiﬁcation, link and graph property prediction, with applications ranging from drug design [ 8], social networks [ 11], transaction networks [16], gene expression networks [9], and knowledge graphs [19]. One major challenge of training GNNs comes from the requirements of heavy ﬂoating point operations and large memory footprints, due to the recursive expansions over the neighborhoods. For a minibatch with a single vertex vi, to compute its embedding h(L) i at the L-th layer, we have to expand its neighborhood from the (L−1)-th layer to the 0-th layer, i.e. L-hops neighbors. That will soon cover ∗Equal Contribution. Preprint. Under review. arXiv:2006.05806v2  [cs.LG]  11 Jun 2020a large portion of the graph if particularly the graph is dense. One basic idea of alleviating such “neighbor explosion” problem was to sample neighbors in a top-down manner, i.e. sample neighbors in the l-th layer given the nodes in the (l+ 1)-th layer recursively. Several layer sampling approaches [11, 6, 14, 25] have been proposed to alleviate above “neighbor explosion” problem and improve the convergence of training GCNs, e.g. with importance sampling. However, the optimal sampler [14], q⋆ ij = αij∥h(l) j ∥2 ∑ k∈Ni αik∥h(l) k ∥2 for vertex vi, to minimize the variance of the estimator ˆh(l+1) i involves all its neighbors’ hidden embeddings, i.e.{ˆh(l) j |vj ∈Ni}, which is infeasible to be computed because we can only observe them partially while doing sampling. Existing approaches [6, 14, 25] typically compromise the optimal sampling distribution via approximations, which may impede the convergence. Moreover, such approaches are not applicable to more general cases where the weights or kernelsαij’s are not known a priori, but are learned weights parameterized by attention functions [22]. That is, both the hidden embeddings and learned weights involved in the optimal sampler constantly vary during the training process, and only part of the unnormalized attention values or hidden embeddings can be observed while do sampling. Present work. We derive novel variance reduced samplers for training of GCNs and attentive GNNs with a fundamentally different perspective. That is, different with existing approaches that need to compute the immediate sampling distribution, we maintain nonparametric estimates of the sampler instead, and update the sampler towards optimal variance after we acquire partial knowledges about neighbors being sampled, as the algorithm iterates. To fulﬁl this purpose, we formulate the optimization of the samplers as a bandit problem, where the regret is the gap between expected loss (negative reward) under current policy (sampler) and expected loss with optimal policy. We deﬁne the reward with respect to each action, i.e. the choice of a set of neighbors with sample size k, as the derivatives of the sampling variance, and show the variance of our samplers asymptotically approaches the optimal variance within a factor of3. Under this problem formulation, we propose two bandit algorithms. The ﬁrst algorithm based on multi-armed bandit (MAB) chooses k < Karms (neighbors) repeatedly. Our second algorithm based on MAB with multiple plays chooses a combinatorial set of neighbors with size konly once. To summarize, ( 1) We recast the sampler for GNNs as a bandit problem from a fundamentally different perspective. It works for GCNs and attentive GNNs while existing approaches apply only to GCNs. ( 2) We theoretically show that the regret with respect to the variance of our estimators asymptotically approximates the optimal sampler within a factor of 3 while no existing approaches optimize the sampler. ( 3) We empirically show that our approachs are way competitive in terms of convergence and sample variance, compared with state-of-the-art approaches on multiple public datasets. 2 Problem Setting Let G= (V,E) denote the graph with N nodes vi ∈V, and edges (vi,vj) ∈E. Let the adjacency matrix denote as A∈RN×N. Assuming the feature matrix H(0) ∈RN×D(0) with h(0) i denoting the D(0)-dimensional feature of node vi. We focus on the following simple but general form of GNNs: h(l+1) i = σ ( N∑ j=1 α(vi,vj) h(l) j W(l) ) , l = 0,...,L −1 (1) where h(l) i is the hidden embedding of node vi at the l-th layer, ααα= (α(vi,vj)) ∈RN×N is a kernel or weight matrix, W(l) ∈RD(l)×D(l+1) is the transform parameter on the l-th layer, and σ(·) is the activation function. The weight α(vi,vj), or αij for simplicity, is non-zero only if vj is in the 1-hop neighborhood Ni of vi. It varies with the aggregation functions [ 3, 23]. For example, (1) GCNs [8, 15] deﬁne ﬁxed weights as ααα= ˜D−1 ˜Aor ααα= ˜D−1 2 ˜A˜D−1 2 respectively, where ˜A= A+I, and ˜Dis the diagonal node degree matrix of ˜A. (2) The attentive GNNs [22, 17] deﬁne a learned weight α(vi,vj) by attention functions: α(vi,vj) = ˜α(vi,vj;θ)∑ vk∈Ni ˜α(vi,vk;θ) , where the unnormalized attentions ˜α(vi,vj; θ) = exp(ReLU(aT[Whi∥Whj])), are parameterized by θ= {a,W}. Different 2from GCNs, the learned weights αij ∝˜αij can be evaluated only given all the unnormalized weights in the neighborhood. The basic idea of layer sampling approaches [11, 6, 14, 25] was to recast the evaluation of Eq. (1) as ˆh(l+1) i = σ ( N(i) Epij [ ˆh(l) j ] W(l) ) , (2) where pij ∝αij, and N(i) =∑ jαij. Hence we can evaluate each node vi at the (l+ 1)-th layer, using a Monte Carlo estimator with sampled neighbors at the l-th layer. Without loss of generality, we assume pij = αij and N(i) = 1that meet the setting of attentive GNNs in the rest of this paper. To further reduce the variance, let us consider the following importance sampling ˆh(l+1) i = σW(l) ( ˆµ(l) i ) = σW(l) ( Eqij [αij qij ˆh(l) j ]) , (3) where we use σW(l) (·) to include transform parameter W(l) into the function σ(·) for conciseness. As such, one can ﬁnd an alternative sampling distribution qi = (qij1 ,...,q ij|Ni|) to reduce the variance of an estimator, e.g. a Monte Carlo estimator ˆµ(l) i = 1 k ∑k s=1 αijs qijs ˆh(l) js , where js ∼qi. Take expectation overqi, we deﬁne the variance of ˆµ(l) i = αijs qijs ˆh(l) js at step tand (l+ 1)-th layer to be: Vt(qi) =E [ˆµ(l) i (t) −µ(l) i (t)  2] = E [αijs(t) qijs h(l) js (t) − ∑ j∈Ni αij(t)h(l) j (t)  2] . (4) Note that αij and h(vj) that are inferred during training may vary over steps t’s. We will explicitly include step tand layer lonly when it is necessary. By expanding Eq. (4) one can write V(qi) as the difference of two terms. The ﬁrst is a function of qi, which we refer to as the effective variance: Ve(qi) = ∑ j∈Ni 1 qij α2 ij∥hj∥2 , (5) while the second does not depend on qi, and we denote it by Vc = ∑ j∈Ni αijhj  2 . The optimal sampling distribution [6, 14] at (l+ 1)-th layer for vertex ithat minimizes the variance is: q⋆ ij = αij∥h(l) j ∥2 ∑ k∈Ni αik∥h(l) k ∥2 . (6) However, evaluating this sampling distribution is infeasible because we cannot have all the knowledges of neighbors’ embeddings in the denominator of Eq.(6). Moreover, the αij’s in attentive GNNs could also vary during the training procedure. Existing layer sampling approaches based on importance sampling just ignore the effects of norm of embeddings and assume theαij’s are ﬁxed during training. As a result, the sampling distribution is suboptimal and only applicable to GCNs where the weights are ﬁxed. Note that our derivation above follows the setting of node-wise sampling approaches [11], but the claim remains to hold for layer-wise sampling approaches [6, 14, 25]. 3 Related Works We summarize three types of works for training graph neural networks. First, several “layer sampling” approaches [11, 6, 14, 25] have been proposed to alleviate the “neigh- bor explosion” problems. Given a minibatch of labeled vertices at each iteration, such approaches sample neighbors layer by layer in a top-down manner. Particularly, node-wise samplers [11] ran- domly sample neighbors in the lower layer given each node in the upper layer, while layer-wise samplers [6, 14, 25] leverage importance sampling to sample neighbors in the lower layer given all the nodes in upper layer with sample sizes of each layer be independent of each other. Empirically, the layer-wise samplers work even worse [5] compared with node-wise samplers, and one can set an appropriate sample size for each layer to alleviate the growth issue of node-wise samplers. In this paper, we focus on optimizing the variance in the vein of layer sampling approaches. Though the 3derivation of our bandit samplers follows the node-wise samplers, it can be extended to layer-wise. We leave this extension as a future work. Second, Chen et al. [5] proposed a variance reduced estimator by maintaining historical embeddings of each vertices, based on the assumption that the embeddings of a single vertex would be close to its history. This estimator uses a simple random sampler and works efﬁcient in practice at the expense of requiring an extra storage that is linear with number of nodes. Third, two “graph sampling” approaches [7, 24] ﬁrst cut the graph into partitions [ 7] or sample into subgraphs [24], then they train models on those partitions or subgraphs in a batch mode [ 15]. They show that the training time of each epoch may be much faster compared with “layer sampling” approaches. We summarize the drawbacks as follows. First, the partition of the original graph could be sensitive to the training problem. Second, these approaches assume that all the vertices in the graph have labels, however, in practice only partial vertices may have labels [12, 16]. GNNs Architecture.For readers who are interested in the works related to the architecture of GNNs, please refer to the comprehensive survey [23]. Existing sampling approaches works only on GCNs, but not on more advanced architectures like GAT [22]. 4 Variance Reduced Samplers as Bandit Problems We formulate the optimization of sampling variance as a bandit problem. Our basic idea is that instead of explicitly calculating the intractable optimal sampling distribution in Eq. (6) at each iteration, we aim to optimize a sampler or policy Qt i for each vertex iover the horizontal steps 1 ≤t≤T, and make the variance of the estimator following this sampler asymptotically approach the optimum Q⋆ i = argmin Qi ∑T t=1 Vt e(Qi), such that ∑T t=1 Vt e(Qt i) ≤c∑T t=1 Vt e(Q⋆ i) for some constant c >1. Each action of policy Qt i is a choice of any subset of neighbors Si ⊂Ni where Si ∼Qt i. We denote Qi,Si(t) as the probability of the action that vi chooses Si at t. The gap to be minimized between effective variance and the oracle is Vt e(Qt i) −Vt e(Q⋆ i) ≤⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩. (7) Note that the function Vt e(Qt i) is convex w.r.t Qt i, hence for Qt i and Q⋆ i we have the upper bound derived on right hand of Eq. (7). We deﬁne this upper bound as regret at t, which means the expected loss (negative reward) with policy Qt i minus the expected loss with optimal policy Q⋆ i. Hence the reward w.r.t choosing Si at tis the negative derivative of the effective varianceri,Si(t) = −∇Qi,Si(t)Vt e(Qt i). In the following, we adapt this bandit problem in the adversary bandit setting [1] because the rewards vary as the training proceeds and do not follow a priori ﬁxed distribution [4]. We leave the studies of other bandits as a future work. We show in section 6 that with this regret the variances of our estimators asymptotically approach the optimal variance within a factor of 3. Our samplers sample 1-element subset of neighbors k times or a k-element subset of neighbors once from the alternative sampling distribution qt i = (qij1 (t),...,q ij|Ni|(t)) for each vertex vi. We instantiate above framework under two bandit settings.(1) In the adversary MAB setting [1], we deﬁne the sampler Qt i as qt i, that samples exact anarm (neighbor) vjs ⊂Nifrom qt i. In this case the set Siis the 1-element subset {vjs}. To have a sample size ofkneighbors, we repeat this action ktimes. After we collected krewards rijs(t) =−∇qi,js(t)Vt e(qt i) we update qt i by EXP3 [1]. (2) In the adversary MAB with multiple plays setting [21], it uses an efﬁcient k-combination sampler (DepRound [10]) Qi to sample any k-element subset Si ⊂Ni that satisﬁes ∑ Si:j∈Si Qi,Si = qij,∀vj ∈Ni, where qij corresponds to the alternative probability of sampling vj. As such, it allows us to select from a set of (|Ni| k ) distinct subsets of armsfrom |Ni|arms at once. The selection can be done in O(|Ni|). After we collected the reward −∇Qi,Si(t)Vt e(Qt i), we update qt i by EXP3.M [21]. Discussions. We have to select a sample size of k neighbors in GNNs. Note that in the rigorous bandit setting, exact one action should be made and followed by updating the policy. In adversary MAB, we do the selection ktimes and update the policy, hence strictly speaking applying MAB to our problem is not rigorous. Applying MAB with multiple plays to our problem is rigorous because it allows us to sample k neighbors at once and update the rewards together. For readers who are interested in EXP3, EXP3.M and DepRound, please ﬁnd them in Appendix A. 4Algorithm 1Bandit Samplers for Training GNNs. Require: step T, sample size k, number of layers L, node features H(0), adjacency matrix A. 1: Initialize: qij(1) = 1/|Ni|if j ∈Ni else 0, wij(1) = 1if j ∈Ni else 0. 2: for t= 1to T do 3: Read a minibatch of labeled vertices at layer L. 4: Use sampler qt i or DepRound(k,qt i) to sample neighbors top-down with sample size k. 5: Forward GNN model via estimators deﬁned in Eq.

We show this framework in Algorithm 1. Note that the variance w.r.tqi in Eq. (4) is deﬁned only at the (l+ 1)-th layer, hence we should maintain multiple qi’s at each layer. In practice, we ﬁnd that maintain a single qi and update it only using rewards from the 1-st layer works well enough. The time complexity of our algorithm is same with any node-wise approaches [11]. In addition, it requires a storage in O(|E|) to maintain nonparametric estimates qi’s. It remains to instantiate the estimators, variances and rewards related to our two bandit settings. We name our ﬁrst algorithm GNN-BS under adversary MAB setting, and the second GNN-BS.M under adversary MAB with multiple plays setting. We ﬁrst assume the weights αij’s are ﬁxed, then extend to attentive GNNs that αij(t)’s change. 5.1 GNN-BS: Graph Neural Networks with Bandit Sampler In this setting, we choose 1 arm and repeat ktimes. We have the following Monte Carlo estimator ˆµi = 1 k k∑ s=1 αijs qijs ˆhjs, js ∼qi. (8) This yields the variance V(qi) = 1 k Eqi [ αijs qijs hjs −∑ j∈Ni αijhj  2] . Following Eq. (5) and Eq. (7), we have the reward of vi picking neighbor vj at step tas rij(t) =−∇qij(t)Vt e(qt i) = α2 ij k·qij(t)2 ∥hj(t)∥2. (9) 5.2 GNN-BS.M: Graph Neural Networks with Multiple Plays Bandit Sampler Given a vertex vi, an important property of DepRound is that it satisﬁes ∑ Si:j∈Si Qi,Si = qij,∀vj ∈ Ni, where Si ⊂Ni is any subset of size k. We have the following unbiased estimator. Proposition 1. ˆµi = ∑ js∈Si αijs qijs hjs is the unbiased estimator of µi = ∑ j∈Ni αijhj given that Si is sampled from qi using the DepRound sampler Qi, where Si is the selected k-subset neighbors of vertex i. The effective variance of this estimator is Ve(Qi) =∑ Si⊂Ni Qi,Si∥∑ js∈Si αijs qijs hjs∥2. Since the derivative of this effective variance w.r.t Qi,Si does not factorize, we instead have the following approximated effective variance using Jensen’s inequality. Proposition 2. The effective variance can be approximated by Ve(Qi) ≤∑ js∈Ni αijs qijs ∥hjs∥2. 5Table 1: Dataset summary. “s” dontes multi-class task, and “m” denotes multi-label task.

Follow EXP3.M we use the reward w.r.t each arm asrij(t) = αij qij(t)2 ∥hj(t)∥2,∀j ∈Si. Our proofs rely on the property of DepRound introduced above. 5.3 Extension to Attentive GNNs In this section, we extend our algorithms to attentive GNNs. The issue remained is that the attention value αij can not be evaluated with only sampled neighborhoods, instead, we can only compute the unnormalized attentions ˜αij. We deﬁne the adjusted feedback attention values as follows: α′ ij = ∑ j∈Si qij · ˜αij∑ j∈Si ˜αij , (10) where ˜αij’s are the unnormalized attention values that can be obviously evaluated when we have sampled (vi,vj). We use ∑ j∈Si qij as a surrogate of ∑ j∈Si ˜αij ∑ j∈Ni ˜αij so that we can approximate the truth attention values αij by our adjusted attention values α′ ij. 6 Regret Analysis As we described in section 4, the regret is deﬁned as ⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩. By choosing the reward as the negative derivative of the effective variance, we have the following theorem that our bandit sampling algorithms asymptotically approximate the optimal variance within a factor of 3. Theorem 1. Using Algorithm 1 with η= 0.4 and δ= √ (1−η)η4k5 ln(n/k) Tn4 to minimize the effective variance with respect to {Qt i}1≤t≤T, we have T∑ t=1 Vt e(Qt i) ≤3 T∑ t=1 Vt e(Q⋆ i) + 10 √ Tn4 ln(n/k) k3 (11) where T ≥ln(n/k)n2(1 −η)/(kη2), n= |Ni|. Our proof follows [18] by upper and lower bounding the potential function. The upper and lower bounds are the functions of the alternative sampling probability qij(t) and the reward rij(t) respec- tively. By multiplying the upper and lower bounds by the optimal sampling probability q⋆ i and using the reward deﬁnition in (9), we have the upper bound of the effective variance. The growth of this regret is sublinear in terms of T. The regret decreases in polynomial as sample size kgrows. Note that the number of neighbors nis always well bounded in pratical graphs, and can be considered as a moderate constant number. Compared with existing layer sampling approaches [11, 6, 25] that have a ﬁxed variance given the speciﬁc estimators, this is the ﬁrst work optimizing the sampling variance of GNNs towards optimum. We will empirically show the sampling variances in experiments. 7 Experiments In this section, we conduct extensive experiments compared with state-of-the-art approaches to show the advantage of our training approaches. We use the following rule to name our approaches: GNN 6architecture plus bandit sampler. For example, GCN-BS, GAT-BSand GP-BS denote the training approaches for GCN, GAT [22] and GeniePath [17] respectively. The major purpose of this paper is to compare the effects of our samplers with existing training algorithms, so we compare them by training the same GNN architecture. We use the following architectures unless otherwise stated. We ﬁx the number of layers as 2 as in [15] for all comparison algorithms. We set the dimension of hidden embeddings as 16 for Cora and Pubmed, and 256 for PPI, Reddit and Flickr. For a fair comparison, we do not use the normalization layer [2] particularly used in some works [5, 24]. For attentive GNNs, we use the attention layer proposed in GAT. we set the number of multi-heads as 1 for simplicity. We report results on 5 benchmark data that include Cora [20], Pubmed [20], PPI [11], Reddit [11], and Flickr [24]. We follow the standard data splits, and summarize the statistics in Table 1.

(1) GraphSAGE [11] is a node-wise layer sampling approach with a random sampler. (2) FastGCN [6], LADIES [ 25], and AS-GCN [ 14] are layer sampling approaches based on importance sampling. (3) S-GCN [5] can be viewed as an optimization solver for training of GCN based on a simply random sampler. (4) ClusterGCN [7] and GraphSAINT [24] are “graph sampling” techniques that ﬁrst partition or sample the graph into small subgraphs, then train each subgraph using the batch algorithm [15]. (5) The open source algorithms that support the training of attentive GNNs are AS-GCN and GraphSAINT. We denote them as AS-GAT and GraphSAINT-GAT. We do grid search for the following hyperparameters in each algorithm, i.e., the learning rate {0.01,0.001}, the penalty weight on theℓ2-norm regularizers {0,0.0001,0.0005,0.001}, the dropout rate {0,0.1,0.2,0.3}. By following the exsiting implementations2, we save the model based on the best results on validation, and restore the model to report results on testing data in Section 7.1. For the sample size k in GraphSAGE, S-GCN and our algorithms, we set 1 for Cora and Pubmed, 5 for Flickr, 10 for PPI and reddit. We set the sample size in the ﬁrst and second layer for FastGCN and AS-GCN/AS-GAT as 256 and 256 for Cora and Pubmed, 1,900 and 3,800 for PPI, 780 and 1,560 for Flickr, and 2,350 and 4,700 for Reddit. We set the batch size of all the layer sampling approaches and S-GCN as 256 for all the datasets. For ClusterGCN, we set the partitions according 2Checkout: https://github.com/matenure/FastGCN or https://github.com/huangwb/AS-GCN 7to the suggestions [7] for PPI and Reddit. We set the number of partitions for Cora and Pubmed as 10, for ﬂickr as 200 by doing grid search. We set the architecture of GraphSAINT as “0-1-1”3 which means MLP layer followed by two graph convolution layers. We use the “rw” sampling strategy that reported as the best in their original paper to perform the graph sampling procedure. We set the number of root and walk length as the paper suggested. 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5 20.0 Epoch 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation Cora GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN LADIES AS-GCN ClusterGCN GraphSAINT-GCN S-GCN 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5 20.0 Epoch 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90Micro F1 on validation Pubmed GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN LADIES AS-GCN ClusterGCN GraphSAINT-GCN S-GCN 0 20 40 60 80 100 Epoch 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation PPI GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN LADIES AS-GCN ClusterGCN GraphSAINT-GCN S-GCN 2 4 6 8 10 Epoch 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation Reddit GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN LADIES AS-GCN ClusterGCN GraphSAINT-GCN S-GCN 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5 20.0 Epoch 0.350 0.375 0.400 0.425 0.450 0.475 0.500 0.525Micro F1 on validation Flickr GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN LADIES AS-GCN ClusterGCN GraphSAINT-GCN S-GCN 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5 20.0 Epoch 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation Cora GP-BS.M GAT-BS.M GP-BS GAT-BS GraphSAINT-GAT AS-GAT 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5 20.0 Epoch 0.55 0.60 0.65 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90Micro F1 on validation Pubmed GP-BS.M GAT-BS.M GP-BS GAT-BS GraphSAINT-GAT AS-GAT 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Epoch 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation PPI GP-BS.M GAT-BS.M GP-BS GAT-BS GraphSAINT-GAT AS-GAT 2 4 6 8 10 Epoch 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation Reddit GP-BS.M GAT-BS.M GP-BS GAT-BS GraphSAINT-GAT Figure 1: The convergence on validation in terms of epochs. 7.1 Results on Benchmark Data We report the testing results on GCN and attentive GNN architectures in Table 2 and Table 3 respectively. We run the results of each algorithm3 times and report the mean and standard deviation. The results on the two layer GCN architecture show that our GCN-BS performs the best on most of datasets. The results on the two layer attentive GNN architecture show the superiority of our algorithms on training more complex GNN architectures. GraphSAINT or AS-GAT cannot compute the softmax of learned weights, but simply use the unnormalized weights to perform the aggregation. As a result, most of results from AS-GAT and GraphSAINT-GAT in Table 3 are worse than their results in Table 2. Thanks to the power of attentive structures in GNNs, our algorithms perform better results on PPI and Reddit compared with GCN-BS, and signiﬁcantly outperform the results from AS-GAT and GraphSAINT-GAT. 7.2 Convergence In this section, we analyze the convergences of comparison algorithms on the two layer GCN and attentive GNN architectures in Figure 1 in terms of epoch. We run all the algorithms3 times and show the mean and standard deviation. Our approaches consistently converge to better results with faster 3Checkout https://github.com/GraphSAINT/ for more details. 8rates and lower variances in most of datasets like Pubmed, PPI, Reddit and Flickr compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. The GNN-BS algorithms perform very similar to GNN-BS.M, even though strictly speaking GNN-BS does not follow the rigorous MAB setting. Furthermore, we show a huge improvement on the training of attentive GNN architectures compared with GraphSAINT-GAT and AS-GAT. The convergences on validation in terms of timing (seconds), compared with layer sampling approaches, in Appendix C.1 show the similar results. We further give a discussion about timing among layer sampling approaches and graph sampling approaches in Appendix C.2. 3 5 7 10 Sample Size 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Micro F1 on test FastGCN LADIES AS-GCN GraphSAGE S-GCN GCN-BS AS-GAT GP-BS 3 5 7 10 Sample Size 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0Variance FastGCN LADIES AS-GCN GraphSAGE S-GCN GCN-BS AS-GAT GP-BS Figure 2: Comparisons on PPI by varying the sample sizes: ( left) F1 score, (right) sample variances. 7.3 Sample Size Analysis We analyze the sampling variances and accuracy as sample size varies using PPI data. Note that existing layer sampling approaches do not optimize the variances once the samplers are speciﬁed. As a result, their variances are simply ﬁxed [25], while our approaches asymptotically appoach the optimum. For comparison, we train our models until convergence, then compute the average sampling variances. We show the results in Figure 2. The results are grouped into two categories, i.e. results for GCNs and attentive GNNs respectively. The sampling variances of our approaches are smaller in each group, and even be smaller than the variances of S-GCN that leverages a variance reduction solver. This explains the performances of our approaches on testing Micro F1 scores. We also ﬁnd that the overall sampling variances of node-wise approaches are way better than those of layer-wise approaches. 8 Conclusions In this paper, we show that the optimal layer samplers based on importance sampling for training general graph neural networks are computationally intractable, since it needs all the neighbors’ hidden embeddings or learned weights. Instead, we re-formulate the sampling problem as a bandit problem that requires only partial knowledges from neighbors being sampled. We propose two algorithms based on multi-armed bandit and MAB with multiple plays, and show the variance of our bandit sampler asymptotically approaches the optimum within a factor of 3. Furthermore, our algorithms are not only applicable to GCNs but more general architectures like attentive GNNs. We empirically show that our algorithms can converge to better results with faster rates and lower variances compared with state-of-the-art approaches. References [1] P. Auer, N. Cesa-Bianchi, Y .

Proof. Let us denote Qi,Si as the probability of vertex vi choosing any k-element subset Si ⊂Ni from the K-element set Ni using DepRound sampler Qi. This sampler follows the alternative sampling distribution qi = (qij1 ,...,q ijK ) where qijs denotes the alternative probability of sampling neighbor vjs. This sampler is guaranteed to satisfy ∑ Si:j∈Si Qi,Si = qij, i.e. the sum over the probabilities of all subsets Si that contains element jequals the probability qij.

The effective variance can be approximated by Ve(Qi) ≤∑ js∈Ni αijs qijs ∥hjs∥2. Proof. The variance is V(Qi) =E    ∑ js∈Si αijs qijs hjs − ∑ j∈Ni αijhj  2  = ∑ Si⊂Ni Qi,Si  ∑ js∈Si αijs qijs hjs  2 −  ∑ j∈Ni αijhj  2 .

Lemma 1. For any real value constantη≤1 and any valid distributions Qt i and Q⋆ i we have (1 −2η)Vt e(Qt i) −(1 −η)Vt e(Q⋆ i) ≤⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩+ η⟨Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩ (18) Proof. The function Vt e(Q) is convex with respect to Q, hence for any Qt i and Q⋆ i we have Vt e(Qt i) −Vt e(Q⋆ i) ≤⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩. (19) Multiplying both sides of this inequality by 1 −η, we have (1 −η)Vt e(Qt i) −(1 −η)Vt e(Q⋆ i) (20) ≤⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩−η⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩. (21) In the following, we prove this Lemma in our two bandit settings: adversary MAB setting and adversary MAB with multiple plays setting. In adversary MAB setting, we have ⟨Qt i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩= − ∑ j∈Ni qij(t) α2 ij k·qij(t)2 ∥hj(t)∥2 (22) = −Vt e(Qt i) (23) In adversary MAB with multiple plays setting , we use the approximated effective variance∑ js∈Ni αijs qijs ∥hjs∥2 derived in Proposition 2. For notational simplicity, we denote the approxi- mated effective variance as Ve in the following. We have ⟨Qt i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩= − ∑ Si⊂Ni Qt i,Si ∑ js∈Si αijs qijs(t)2 ∥hjs∥2 (24) = − ∑ js∈Ni αijs qijs(t)2 ∥hjs∥2 ∑ Si:js∈Si Qt i,Si (25) = − ∑ js∈Ni αijs qijs(t)∥hjs∥2 (26) = −Vt e(Qt i). (27) The equation (24) holds because of Proposition 3. 14At last, we conclude the proof (1 −η)Vt e(Qt i) −(1 −η)Vt e(Q⋆ i) (28) ≤⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩−η⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩ (29) = ⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩+ η⟨Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩+ ηVt e(Qt i). (30) Theorem 1. Using Algorithm 1 with η= 0.4 and δ = √ (1 −η)η4k5 ln(n/k)/(Tn4) to minimize effective variance with respect to {Qt i}1≤t≤T, we have T∑ t=1 Vt e(Qt i) ≤3 T∑ t=1 Vt e(Q⋆ i) + 10 √ Tn4 ln(n/k) k3 (31) where T ≥ln(n/k)n2(1 −η)/(kη2) and n= |Ni|. Proof. First we explain why condition T ≥ln(n/k)n2(1 −η)/(kη2) ensures that δˆrij(t) ≤1, δˆrij(t) = √ (1 −η)η4k5 ln(n/k) Tn4 ·αij(t) q3 ij(t) ∥hj(t)∥2 (32) ≤ √ (1 −η)η4k5 ln(n/k) Tn4 · n3 k3η3 (33) ≤1 (34) Assuming ∥hj(t)∥≤ 1, inequality (33) holds because αij(t) ≤1 and qij(t) ≥kη/n. Then replace T by the condition, we get δˆrij(t) ≤1. Let Wi(t), W′ i(t) denote ∑ j∈Ni wij(t), ∑ j∈Ni w′ ij(t) respectively. Then for any t= 1,2,...,T , Wi(t+ 1) Wi(t) = ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i wij(t+ 1) Wi(t) + ∑ j∈Ut i wij(t+ 1) Wi(t) (35) = ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i wij(t) Wi(t) ·exp(δˆrij(t)) + ∑ j∈Ut i wij(t) Wi(t) (36) ≤ ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i wij(t) Wi(t) [ 1 +δˆrij(t) + (δˆrij(t))2] + ∑ j∈Ut i wij(t) Wi(t) (37) = 1 +W′ i (t) Wi(t) ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i wij(t) W′ i (t) [ δˆrij(t) + (δˆrij(t))2] (38) = 1 +W′ i (t) Wi(t) ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)/k−η/n 1 −η [ δˆrij(t) + (δˆrij(t))2] (39) ≤1 + δ k(1 −η) ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆrij(t) + δ2 k(1 −η) ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆr2 ij(t) (40) Inequality (37) uses ea ≤1 +a+ a2 for a≤1. Equality (39) holds because of update equation of qij(t) deﬁned in EXP3.M. Inequality (40) holds because W′ i (t) Wi(t) ≤1. Since 1 +x≤ex for x≥0, we have ln Wi(t+ 1) Wi(t) ≤ δ k(1 −η) ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆrij(t) + δ2 k(1 −η) ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆr2 ij(t) (41) 15If we sum, for 1 ≤t≤T, we get the following telescopic sum ln Wi(T + 1) Wi(1) = T∑ t=1 ln Wi(t+ 1) Wi(t) (42) ≤ δ k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆrij(t) + δ2 k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆr2 ij(t) (43) ≤ δ k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆrij(t) + δ2 k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni qij(t)ˆr2 ij(t) (44) On the other hand, for any subset Scontaining k elements, ln Wi(T + 1) Wi(1) ≥ln ∑ j∈S wij(T + 1) Wi(1) (45) ≥ ∑ j∈S ln wij(T + 1) k −ln n k (46) ≥δ k ∑ j∈S ∑ t:j /∈Ut i ˆrij(t) −ln n k (47) The inequality (46) uses the fact that ∑ j∈S wij(T + 1)≥k( ∏ j∈S wij(T + 1))1/k The equation (47) uses the fact that wij(T + 1) = exp(δ ∑ t:j /∈Ut i ˆrij(t)) From (44) and (47), we get δ k ∑ j∈S ∑ t:j /∈Ut i ˆrij(t) −ln n k ≤ δ k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆrij(t) + δ2 k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆr2 ij(t) (48) And we have the following inequality δ k ∑ j∈S ∑ t:j∈Ut i rij(t) = δ k ∑ j∈S ∑ t:j∈Ut i qij(t)ˆrij(t) (49) ≤ δ k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ut i qij(t)ˆrij(t) (50) The equality (49) holds beacuse rij(t) =qijˆrij(t) when j ∈St i and Ut i ⊆St i bacause qt ij = 1for all j ∈Ut i. Then add inequality (50) in (48) we have δ k ∑ j∈S ∑ t:j∈Ut i rij(t) +δ k ∑ j∈S ∑ t:j /∈Ut i ˆrij(t) −ln n k (51) ≤ δ k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni qij(t)ˆrij(t) + δ2 k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni qij(t)ˆr2 ij(t) (52) Given qij(t) we have E[ˆr2 ij(t)] =r2 ij(t)/qij(t), hence, taking expectation of (51) yields that δ k T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈S rij(t) −ln n k ≤ δ k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni qij(t)rij(t) + δ2 k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni r2 ij(t) (53) 16By multiplying (53) by Q⋆ i,S and summing over S, we get δ k T∑ t=1 ∑ S⊂Ni Q⋆ i,S ∑ j∈S rij(t) −ln n k ≤ δ k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni qij(t)rij(t) + δ2 k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni r2 ij(t) (54) As ∑ j∈Ni qij(t)rij(t) = ∑ j∈Ni ∑ Si:j∈Si Qt i,Sirij(t) (55) = ∑ Si⊂Ni Qt i,Si ∑ j∈Si rij(t) (56) = − ∑ Si⊂Ni Qt i,Si∇Qt i,Si Vt e(Qt i,Si) (57) = −⟨Qt i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩ (58) By plugging (58) in (54) and rearranging it, we ﬁnd T∑ t=1 ⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i ,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩+ η T∑ t=1 ⟨Q⋆ i ,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩ (59) ≤δ T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni r2 ij(t) +(1 −η)k δ ln(n/k) Using Lemma 1, we have (1 −2η) T∑ t=1 Vt e(Qt i) −(1 −η) T∑ t=1 Vt e(Q⋆ i ) ≤δ T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni r2 ij(t) +(1 −η)k δ ln(n/k) (60) Finally, we know that ∑ j∈Ni r2 ij(t) = ∑ j∈Ni αij(t)2 qij(t)4 (61) ≤ ∑ j∈Ni αij(t) n4 k4η4 (becauseqij(t) ≥kη/n) (62) = n4 k4η4 (63) By setting η= 0.4 and δ= √ (1 −η)η4k5 ln(n/k)/(Tn4), we get the upper bound. C Experiments C.1 Convergences We show the convergences on validation in terms of timing (seconds) in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Basically, our algorithms converge to much better results in nearly same duration compared with other “layer sampling” approaches. Note that we cannot complete the training of AS-GAT on Reddit because of memory issues. C.2 Discussions on Timings between Layer Sampling and Graph Sampling Paradigms Note that the comparisons of timing between “graph sampling” and “layer sampling” paradigms have been studied recently in [ 7, 24]. As a result, we do not compare the timing with “graph sampling” approaches. Under certain conditions, the graph sampling approaches should be faster than layer sampling approaches. That is, graph sampling approaches are designed for graph data that all vertices have labels. Under such condition, the ﬂoating point operations analyzed in [7] are 170.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 Time 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8Micro F1 on validation Cora GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN AS-GCN LADIES 5 10 15 20 Time 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90Micro F1 on validation Pubmed GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN AS-GCN LADIES 0 1000 2000 3000 Time 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation PPI GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN AS-GCN LADIES 500 1000 1500 Time 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation Reddit GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN AS-GCN LADIES 100 200 300 400 Time 0.40 0.45 0.50Micro F1 on validation Flickr GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN AS-GCN LADIES Figure 3: The convergence in timing (seconds) on GCNs. 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 Time 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8Micro F1 on validation Cora GP-BS.M GP-BS GAT-BS.M GAT-BS AS-GAT 0 10 20 30 Time 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation Pubmed GP-BS.M GP-BS GAT-BS.M GAT-BS AS-GAT 0 1000 2000 Time 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation PPI GP-BS.M GP-BS GAT-BS.M GAT-BS AS-GAT 100 200 300 Time 0.44 0.46 0.48 0.50Micro F1 on validation Flickr GP-BS.M GP-BS GAT-BS.M GAT-BS AS-GAT Figure 4: The convergence in timing (seconds) on attentive GNNs. maximally utilized compared with the “layer sampling” paradigm. However, in practice, there are large amount of graph data with labels only on some types of vertices, such as the graphs in [ 16]. “Graph sampling” approaches are not applicable to cases where only partial vertices have labels. To summarize, the “layer sampling” approaches are more ﬂexible and general compared with “graph sampling” approaches in many cases. C.3 Results on OGB We report our results on OGB protein dataset [13]. We set the learning rate as 1e-3, batch size as 256, the dimension of hidden embeddings as 64, sample size as 10 and epochs as 200. We save the model based on the best results on validation and report results on testing data. We run the experiment 10 times with different random seeds to compute the average and standard deviation of the results. Our result of GP-BS on protein dataset performs the best4 until we submitted this paper. Please ﬁnd our implementations at https://github.com/xavierzw/ogb-geniepath-bs.

        "main_contributions": "The paper addresses the challenge of accelerating Graph Neural Network (GNN) training by optimizing sampling, particularly for Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and attentive GNNs. Existing variance reduction sampling methods are suboptimal or inapplicable to general GNNs because optimal sampling distributions depend on changing node embeddings and learned weights, making full computation intractable. The main contributions are: (1) Formulating the optimization of sampling variance as an adversary bandit problem, where rewards relate to node embeddings and learned weights, varying constantly during training. (2) Proposing two bandit algorithms: GNN-BS (Multi-Armed Bandit) and GNN-BS.M (Multi-Armed Bandit with Multiple Plays). (3) Theoretically demonstrating that the proposed algorithms asymptotically approach the optimal sampling variance within a factor of 3. (4) Empirically showing superior efficiency and effectiveness in terms of convergence, accuracy (Micro F1 scores), and sample variance on multiple datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods, for both GCNs and more complex attentive GNN architectures.",
        "methodology": "The core methodology involves reframing the GNN sampling problem as an adversary bandit problem to optimize sampling variance. The approach is non-parametric, maintaining and updating a sampler (policy) based on observed partial knowledge of neighbors. 1. Problem Formulation: The optimization of the sampling distribution `qi` for vertex `vi` is cast as an adversary bandit problem, where the regret is the gap between the expected loss under the current policy and the optimal policy. The reward `ri,Si(t)` for choosing a subset of neighbors `Si` at step `t` is defined as the negative derivative of the effective variance. 2. GNN-BS (Multi-Armed Bandit): This algorithm samples `k` individual neighbors (arms) repeatedly. For each sampled neighbor `vj`, a reward `rij(t)` is calculated based on `α^2_ij / (k * q^2_ij(t)) * ||hj(t)||^2`. The sampling distribution `qt i` is updated using the EXP3 algorithm after collecting `k` rewards. The estimator used is `ˆµi = (1/k) * ∑(s=1 to k) (αijs / qijs) * ˆhjs`. 3. GNN-BS.M (Multi-Armed Bandit with Multiple Plays): This algorithm samples a `k`-element subset `Si` of neighbors once using an efficient `k`-combination sampler called DepRound. The reward `ri,Si(t)` is approximated as `∑(js∈Si) (αijs / qijs(t)^2) * ||hjs(t)||^2` based on an approximated effective variance using Jensen's inequality. The sampling distribution `qt i` is updated using the EXP3.M algorithm. 4. Extension to Attentive GNNs: For attentive GNNs where `αij` values are learned and vary, adjusted feedback attention values `α'ij = (∑(j∈Si) qij * ˜αij) / (∑(j∈Si) ˜αij)` are used. This approximates the true attention values with only sampled unnormalized attentions `˜αij`.",
        "experimental_setup": "Experiments were conducted on five benchmark graph datasets: Cora, Pubmed, PPI, Reddit, and Flickr, using standard data splits. Additionally, results on the OGB protein dataset were reported in Appendix C.3. The GNN architectures tested included GCNs and attentive GNNs (GAT and GeniePath), with the number of layers fixed at 2 and hidden embedding dimensions set to 16 for Cora/Pubmed and 256 for PPI/Reddit/Flickr. A single multi-head was used for attentive GNNs. Comparison algorithms included various layer sampling methods (GraphSAGE, FastGCN, LADIES, AS-GCN, S-GCN) and graph sampling techniques (ClusterGCN, GraphSAINT). For attentive GNNs, AS-GAT and GraphSAINT-GAT were used for comparison. Hyperparameters such as learning rate ({0.01, 0.001}), L2-norm regularizers ({0, 0.0001, 0.0005, 0.001}), and dropout rate ({0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3}) were grid-searched. Sample size `k` was set per dataset (e.g., 1 for Cora/Pubmed, 5 for Flickr, 10 for PPI/Reddit). Batch size for layer sampling methods and S-GCN was 256. Model selection was based on the best results on the validation set, with final results reported on the testing data. Performance was evaluated using Micro F1 scores, convergence rates (Micro F1 vs. epochs and time), and analysis of sampling variances across different sample sizes.",
        "limitations": "The paper identifies several limitations concerning existing sampling approaches and its own methods: 1. Intractability of Optimal Samplers: Optimal sampling distributions for GNNs are computationally infeasible as they require full knowledge of all neighbors' hidden embeddings or learned weights, which change during training and are only partially observed. 2. Applicability of Existing Methods: Many existing importance sampling approaches are suboptimal and primarily applicable only to GCNs with fixed weights, failing to generalize to attentive GNNs where weights are learned and vary. 3. Rigorousness of GNN-BS: Strictly speaking, the GNN-BS algorithm (based on the standard Multi-Armed Bandit setting) is not entirely rigorous because it performs `k` selections and then updates the policy, rather than making a single action and updating. 4. Approximation in GNN-BS.M: The effective variance for GNN-BS.M is approximated using Jensen's inequality, rather than being an exact calculation. 5. Graph Sampling Approaches: 'Graph sampling' techniques (like ClusterGCN, GraphSAINT) have drawbacks, including sensitivity of graph partitioning to the training problem and the assumption that all vertices have labels, which is often not true in practice for many graph datasets.",
        "future_research_directions": "The paper suggests the following future research avenues: 1. Extension to Layer-Wise Sampling: While the current derivation follows node-wise sampling, extending the bandit samplers to layer-wise sampling approaches is a potential area for future work. 2. Exploring Other Bandit Settings: The current formulation focuses on the adversary bandit setting. The authors plan to study other bandit settings to further explore and potentially improve the samplers.",

For instance, graph neural networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on learning tasks such as node classiﬁcation, link and graph property prediction, with applications ranging from drug design [ 8], social networks [ 11], transaction networks [16], gene expression networks [9], and knowledge graphs [19]. One major challenge of training GNNs comes from the requirements of heavy ﬂoating point operations and large memory footprints, due to the recursive expansions over the neighborhoods. For a minibatch with a single vertex vi, to compute its embedding h(L) i at the L-th layer, we have to expand its neighborhood from the (L−1)-th layer to the 0-th layer, i.e. L-hops neighbors. That will soon cover ∗Equal Contribution. Preprint. Under review. arXiv:2006.05806v2  [cs.LG]  11 Jun 2020a large portion of the graph if particularly the graph is dense. One basic idea of alleviating such “neighbor explosion” problem was to sample neighbors in a top-down manner, i.e. sample neighbors in the l-th layer given the nodes in the (l+ 1)-th layer recursively. Several layer sampling approaches [11, 6, 14, 25] have been proposed to alleviate above “neighbor explosion” problem and improve the convergence of training GCNs, e.g. with importance sampling. However, the optimal sampler [14], q⋆ ij = αij∥h(l) j ∥2 ∑ k∈Ni αik∥h(l) k ∥2 for vertex vi, to minimize the variance of the estimator ˆh(l+1) i involves all its neighbors’ hidden embeddings, i.e.{ˆh(l) j |vj ∈Ni}, which is infeasible to be computed because we can only observe them partially while doing sampling. Existing approaches [6, 14, 25] typically compromise the optimal sampling distribution via approximations, which may impede the convergence. Moreover, such approaches are not applicable to more general cases where the weights or kernelsαij’s are not known a priori, but are learned weights parameterized by attention functions [22]. That is, both the hidden embeddings and learned weights involved in the optimal sampler constantly vary during the training process, and only part of the unnormalized attention values or hidden embeddings can be observed while do sampling. Present work. We derive novel variance reduced samplers for training of GCNs and attentive GNNs with a fundamentally different perspective. That is, different with existing approaches that need to compute the immediate sampling distribution, we maintain nonparametric estimates of the sampler instead, and update the sampler towards optimal variance after we acquire partial knowledges about neighbors being sampled, as the algorithm iterates. To fulﬁl this purpose, we formulate the optimization of the samplers as a bandit problem, where the regret is the gap between expected loss (negative reward) under current policy (sampler) and expected loss with optimal policy. We deﬁne the reward with respect to each action, i.e. the choice of a set of neighbors with sample size k, as the derivatives of the sampling variance, and show the variance of our samplers asymptotically approaches the optimal variance within a factor of3. Under this problem formulation, we propose two bandit algorithms. The ﬁrst algorithm based on multi-armed bandit (MAB) chooses k < Karms (neighbors) repeatedly. Our second algorithm based on MAB with multiple plays chooses a combinatorial set of neighbors with size konly once. To summarize, ( 1) We recast the sampler for GNNs as a bandit problem from a fundamentally different perspective. It works for GCNs and attentive GNNs while existing approaches apply only to GCNs. ( 2) We theoretically show that the regret with respect to the variance of our estimators asymptotically approximates the optimal sampler within a factor of 3 while no existing approaches optimize the sampler. ( 3) We empirically show that our approachs are way competitive in terms of convergence and sample variance, compared with state-of-the-art approaches on multiple public datasets. 2 Problem Setting Let G= (V,E) denote the graph with N nodes vi ∈V, and edges (vi,vj) ∈E. Let the adjacency matrix denote as A∈RN×N. Assuming the feature matrix H(0) ∈RN×D(0) with h(0) i denoting the D(0)-dimensional feature of node vi. We focus on the following simple but general form of GNNs: h(l+1) i = σ ( N∑ j=1 α(vi,vj) h(l) j W(l) ) , l = 0,...,L −1 (1) where h(l) i is the hidden embedding of node vi at the l-th layer, ααα= (α(vi,vj)) ∈RN×N is a kernel or weight matrix, W(l) ∈RD(l)×D(l+1) is the transform parameter on the l-th layer, and σ(·) is the activation function. The weight α(vi,vj), or αij for simplicity, is non-zero only if vj is in the 1-hop neighborhood Ni of vi. It varies with the aggregation functions [ 3, 23]. For example, (1) GCNs [8, 15] deﬁne ﬁxed weights as ααα= ˜D−1 ˜Aor ααα= ˜D−1 2 ˜A˜D−1 2 respectively, where ˜A= A+I, and ˜Dis the diagonal node degree matrix of ˜A. (2) The attentive GNNs [22, 17] deﬁne a learned weight α(vi,vj) by attention functions: α(vi,vj) = ˜α(vi,vj;θ)∑ vk∈Ni ˜α(vi,vk;θ) , where the unnormalized attentions ˜α(vi,vj; θ) = exp(ReLU(aT[Whi∥Whj])), are parameterized by θ= {a,W}. Different 2from GCNs, the learned weights αij ∝˜αij can be evaluated only given all the unnormalized weights in the neighborhood. The basic idea of layer sampling approaches [11, 6, 14, 25] was to recast the evaluation of Eq. (1) as ˆh(l+1) i = σ ( N(i) Epij [ ˆh(l) j ] W(l) ) , (2) where pij ∝αij, and N(i) =∑ jαij. Hence we can evaluate each node vi at the (l+ 1)-th layer, using a Monte Carlo estimator with sampled neighbors at the l-th layer. Without loss of generality, we assume pij = αij and N(i) = 1that meet the setting of attentive GNNs in the rest of this paper. To further reduce the variance, let us consider the following importance sampling ˆh(l+1) i = σW(l) ( ˆµ(l) i ) = σW(l) ( Eqij [αij qij ˆh(l) j ]) , (3) where we use σW(l) (·) to include transform parameter W(l) into the function σ(·) for conciseness. As such, one can ﬁnd an alternative sampling distribution qi = (qij1 ,...,q ij|Ni|) to reduce the variance of an estimator, e.g. a Monte Carlo estimator ˆµ(l) i = 1 k ∑k s=1 αijs qijs ˆh(l) js , where js ∼qi. Take expectation overqi, we deﬁne the variance of ˆµ(l) i = αijs qijs ˆh(l) js at step tand (l+ 1)-th layer to be: Vt(qi) =E [ˆµ(l) i (t) −µ(l) i (t)  2] = E [αijs(t) qijs h(l) js (t) − ∑ j∈Ni αij(t)h(l) j (t)  2] . (4) Note that αij and h(vj) that are inferred during training may vary over steps t’s. We will explicitly include step tand layer lonly when it is necessary. By expanding Eq. (4) one can write V(qi) as the difference of two terms. The ﬁrst is a function of qi, which we refer to as the effective variance: Ve(qi) = ∑ j∈Ni 1 qij α2 ij∥hj∥2 , (5) while the second does not depend on qi, and we denote it by Vc = ∑ j∈Ni αijhj  2 . The optimal sampling distribution [6, 14] at (l+ 1)-th layer for vertex ithat minimizes the variance is: q⋆ ij = αij∥h(l) j ∥2 ∑ k∈Ni αik∥h(l) k ∥2 . (6) However, evaluating this sampling distribution is infeasible because we cannot have all the knowledges of neighbors’ embeddings in the denominator of Eq.(6). Moreover, the αij’s in attentive GNNs could also vary during the training procedure. Existing layer sampling approaches based on importance sampling just ignore the effects of norm of embeddings and assume theαij’s are ﬁxed during training. As a result, the sampling distribution is suboptimal and only applicable to GCNs where the weights are ﬁxed. Note that our derivation above follows the setting of node-wise sampling approaches [11], but the claim remains to hold for layer-wise sampling approaches [6, 14, 25]. 3 Related Works We summarize three types of works for training graph neural networks. First, several “layer sampling” approaches [11, 6, 14, 25] have been proposed to alleviate the “neigh- bor explosion” problems. Given a minibatch of labeled vertices at each iteration, such approaches sample neighbors layer by layer in a top-down manner. Particularly, node-wise samplers [11] ran- domly sample neighbors in the lower layer given each node in the upper layer, while layer-wise samplers [6, 14, 25] leverage importance sampling to sample neighbors in the lower layer given all the nodes in upper layer with sample sizes of each layer be independent of each other. Empirically, the layer-wise samplers work even worse [5] compared with node-wise samplers, and one can set an appropriate sample size for each layer to alleviate the growth issue of node-wise samplers. In this paper, we focus on optimizing the variance in the vein of layer sampling approaches. Though the 3derivation of our bandit samplers follows the node-wise samplers, it can be extended to layer-wise. We leave this extension as a future work. Second, Chen et al. [5] proposed a variance reduced estimator by maintaining historical embeddings of each vertices, based on the assumption that the embeddings of a single vertex would be close to its history. This estimator uses a simple random sampler and works efﬁcient in practice at the expense of requiring an extra storage that is linear with number of nodes. Third, two “graph sampling” approaches [7, 24] ﬁrst cut the graph into partitions [ 7] or sample into subgraphs [24], then they train models on those partitions or subgraphs in a batch mode [ 15]. They show that the training time of each epoch may be much faster compared with “layer sampling” approaches. We summarize the drawbacks as follows. First, the partition of the original graph could be sensitive to the training problem. Second, these approaches assume that all the vertices in the graph have labels, however, in practice only partial vertices may have labels [12, 16]. GNNs Architecture.For readers who are interested in the works related to the architecture of GNNs, please refer to the comprehensive survey [23]. Existing sampling approaches works only on GCNs, but not on more advanced architectures like GAT [22]. 4 Variance Reduced Samplers as Bandit Problems We formulate the optimization of sampling variance as a bandit problem. Our basic idea is that instead of explicitly calculating the intractable optimal sampling distribution in Eq. (6) at each iteration, we aim to optimize a sampler or policy Qt i for each vertex iover the horizontal steps 1 ≤t≤T, and make the variance of the estimator following this sampler asymptotically approach the optimum Q⋆ i = argmin Qi ∑T t=1 Vt e(Qi), such that ∑T t=1 Vt e(Qt i) ≤c∑T t=1 Vt e(Q⋆ i) for some constant c >1. Each action of policy Qt i is a choice of any subset of neighbors Si ⊂Ni where Si ∼Qt i. We denote Qi,Si(t) as the probability of the action that vi chooses Si at t. The gap to be minimized between effective variance and the oracle is Vt e(Qt i) −Vt e(Q⋆ i) ≤⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩. (7) Note that the function Vt e(Qt i) is convex w.r.t Qt i, hence for Qt i and Q⋆ i we have the upper bound derived on right hand of Eq. (7). We deﬁne this upper bound as regret at t, which means the expected loss (negative reward) with policy Qt i minus the expected loss with optimal policy Q⋆ i. Hence the reward w.r.t choosing Si at tis the negative derivative of the effective varianceri,Si(t) = −∇Qi,Si(t)Vt e(Qt i). In the following, we adapt this bandit problem in the adversary bandit setting [1] because the rewards vary as the training proceeds and do not follow a priori ﬁxed distribution [4]. We leave the studies of other bandits as a future work. We show in section 6 that with this regret the variances of our estimators asymptotically approach the optimal variance within a factor of 3. Our samplers sample 1-element subset of neighbors k times or a k-element subset of neighbors once from the alternative sampling distribution qt i = (qij1 (t),...,q ij|Ni|(t)) for each vertex vi. We instantiate above framework under two bandit settings.(1) In the adversary MAB setting [1], we deﬁne the sampler Qt i as qt i, that samples exact anarm (neighbor) vjs ⊂Nifrom qt i. In this case the set Siis the 1-element subset {vjs}. To have a sample size ofkneighbors, we repeat this action ktimes. After we collected krewards rijs(t) =−∇qi,js(t)Vt e(qt i) we update qt i by EXP3 [1]. (2) In the adversary MAB with multiple plays setting [21], it uses an efﬁcient k-combination sampler (DepRound [10]) Qi to sample any k-element subset Si ⊂Ni that satisﬁes ∑ Si:j∈Si Qi,Si = qij,∀vj ∈Ni, where qij corresponds to the alternative probability of sampling vj. As such, it allows us to select from a set of (|Ni| k ) distinct subsets of armsfrom |Ni|arms at once. The selection can be done in O(|Ni|). After we collected the reward −∇Qi,Si(t)Vt e(Qt i), we update qt i by EXP3.M [21]. Discussions. We have to select a sample size of k neighbors in GNNs. Note that in the rigorous bandit setting, exact one action should be made and followed by updating the policy. In adversary MAB, we do the selection ktimes and update the policy, hence strictly speaking applying MAB to our problem is not rigorous. Applying MAB with multiple plays to our problem is rigorous because it allows us to sample k neighbors at once and update the rewards together. For readers who are interested in EXP3, EXP3.M and DepRound, please ﬁnd them in Appendix A. 4Algorithm 1Bandit Samplers for Training GNNs. Require: step T, sample size k, number of layers L, node features H(0), adjacency matrix A. 1: Initialize: qij(1) = 1/|Ni|if j ∈Ni else 0, wij(1) = 1if j ∈Ni else 0. 2: for t= 1to T do 3: Read a minibatch of labeled vertices at layer L. 4: Use sampler qt i or DepRound(k,qt i) to sample neighbors top-down with sample size k. 5: Forward GNN model via estimators deﬁned in Eq.

We show this framework in Algorithm 1. Note that the variance w.r.tqi in Eq. (4) is deﬁned only at the (l+ 1)-th layer, hence we should maintain multiple qi’s at each layer. In practice, we ﬁnd that maintain a single qi and update it only using rewards from the 1-st layer works well enough. The time complexity of our algorithm is same with any node-wise approaches [11]. In addition, it requires a storage in O(|E|) to maintain nonparametric estimates qi’s. It remains to instantiate the estimators, variances and rewards related to our two bandit settings. We name our ﬁrst algorithm GNN-BS under adversary MAB setting, and the second GNN-BS.M under adversary MAB with multiple plays setting. We ﬁrst assume the weights αij’s are ﬁxed, then extend to attentive GNNs that αij(t)’s change. 5.1 GNN-BS: Graph Neural Networks with Bandit Sampler In this setting, we choose 1 arm and repeat ktimes. We have the following Monte Carlo estimator ˆµi = 1 k k∑ s=1 αijs qijs ˆhjs, js ∼qi. (8) This yields the variance V(qi) = 1 k Eqi [ αijs qijs hjs −∑ j∈Ni αijhj  2] . Following Eq. (5) and Eq. (7), we have the reward of vi picking neighbor vj at step tas rij(t) =−∇qij(t)Vt e(qt i) = α2 ij k·qij(t)2 ∥hj(t)∥2. (9) 5.2 GNN-BS.M: Graph Neural Networks with Multiple Plays Bandit Sampler Given a vertex vi, an important property of DepRound is that it satisﬁes ∑ Si:j∈Si Qi,Si = qij,∀vj ∈ Ni, where Si ⊂Ni is any subset of size k. We have the following unbiased estimator. Proposition 1. ˆµi = ∑ js∈Si αijs qijs hjs is the unbiased estimator of µi = ∑ j∈Ni αijhj given that Si is sampled from qi using the DepRound sampler Qi, where Si is the selected k-subset neighbors of vertex i. The effective variance of this estimator is Ve(Qi) =∑ Si⊂Ni Qi,Si∥∑ js∈Si αijs qijs hjs∥2. Since the derivative of this effective variance w.r.t Qi,Si does not factorize, we instead have the following approximated effective variance using Jensen’s inequality. Proposition 2. The effective variance can be approximated by Ve(Qi) ≤∑ js∈Ni αijs qijs ∥hjs∥2. 5Table 1: Dataset summary. “s” dontes multi-class task, and “m” denotes multi-label task.

Our proofs rely on the property of DepRound introduced above. 5.3 Extension to Attentive GNNs In this section, we extend our algorithms to attentive GNNs. The issue remained is that the attention value αij can not be evaluated with only sampled neighborhoods, instead, we can only compute the unnormalized attentions ˜αij. We deﬁne the adjusted feedback attention values as follows: α′ ij = ∑ j∈Si qij · ˜αij∑ j∈Si ˜αij , (10) where ˜αij’s are the unnormalized attention values that can be obviously evaluated when we have sampled (vi,vj). We use ∑ j∈Si qij as a surrogate of ∑ j∈Si ˜αij ∑ j∈Ni ˜αij so that we can approximate the truth attention values αij by our adjusted attention values α′ ij. 6 Regret Analysis As we described in section 4, the regret is deﬁned as ⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩. By choosing the reward as the negative derivative of the effective variance, we have the following theorem that our bandit sampling algorithms asymptotically approximate the optimal variance within a factor of 3. Theorem 1. Using Algorithm 1 with η= 0.4 and δ= √ (1−η)η4k5 ln(n/k) Tn4 to minimize the effective variance with respect to {Qt i}1≤t≤T, we have T∑ t=1 Vt e(Qt i) ≤3 T∑ t=1 Vt e(Q⋆ i) + 10 √ Tn4 ln(n/k) k3 (11) where T ≥ln(n/k)n2(1 −η)/(kη2), n= |Ni|. Our proof follows [18] by upper and lower bounding the potential function. The upper and lower bounds are the functions of the alternative sampling probability qij(t) and the reward rij(t) respec- tively. By multiplying the upper and lower bounds by the optimal sampling probability q⋆ i and using the reward deﬁnition in (9), we have the upper bound of the effective variance. The growth of this regret is sublinear in terms of T. The regret decreases in polynomial as sample size kgrows. Note that the number of neighbors nis always well bounded in pratical graphs, and can be considered as a moderate constant number. Compared with existing layer sampling approaches [11, 6, 25] that have a ﬁxed variance given the speciﬁc estimators, this is the ﬁrst work optimizing the sampling variance of GNNs towards optimum. We will empirically show the sampling variances in experiments. 7 Experiments In this section, we conduct extensive experiments compared with state-of-the-art approaches to show the advantage of our training approaches. We use the following rule to name our approaches: GNN 6architecture plus bandit sampler. For example, GCN-BS, GAT-BSand GP-BS denote the training approaches for GCN, GAT [22] and GeniePath [17] respectively. The major purpose of this paper is to compare the effects of our samplers with existing training algorithms, so we compare them by training the same GNN architecture. We use the following architectures unless otherwise stated. We ﬁx the number of layers as 2 as in [15] for all comparison algorithms. We set the dimension of hidden embeddings as 16 for Cora and Pubmed, and 256 for PPI, Reddit and Flickr. For a fair comparison, we do not use the normalization layer [2] particularly used in some works [5, 24]. For attentive GNNs, we use the attention layer proposed in GAT. we set the number of multi-heads as 1 for simplicity. We report results on 5 benchmark data that include Cora [20], Pubmed [20], PPI [11], Reddit [11], and Flickr [24]. We follow the standard data splits, and summarize the statistics in Table 1.

(1) GraphSAGE [11] is a node-wise layer sampling approach with a random sampler. (2) FastGCN [6], LADIES [ 25], and AS-GCN [ 14] are layer sampling approaches based on importance sampling. (3) S-GCN [5] can be viewed as an optimization solver for training of GCN based on a simply random sampler. (4) ClusterGCN [7] and GraphSAINT [24] are “graph sampling” techniques that ﬁrst partition or sample the graph into small subgraphs, then train each subgraph using the batch algorithm [15]. (5) The open source algorithms that support the training of attentive GNNs are AS-GCN and GraphSAINT. We denote them as AS-GAT and GraphSAINT-GAT. We do grid search for the following hyperparameters in each algorithm, i.e., the learning rate {0.01,0.001}, the penalty weight on theℓ2-norm regularizers {0,0.0001,0.0005,0.001}, the dropout rate {0,0.1,0.2,0.3}. By following the exsiting implementations2, we save the model based on the best results on validation, and restore the model to report results on testing data in Section 7.1. For the sample size k in GraphSAGE, S-GCN and our algorithms, we set 1 for Cora and Pubmed, 5 for Flickr, 10 for PPI and reddit. We set the sample size in the ﬁrst and second layer for FastGCN and AS-GCN/AS-GAT as 256 and 256 for Cora and Pubmed, 1,900 and 3,800 for PPI, 780 and 1,560 for Flickr, and 2,350 and 4,700 for Reddit. We set the batch size of all the layer sampling approaches and S-GCN as 256 for all the datasets. For ClusterGCN, we set the partitions according 2Checkout: https://github.com/matenure/FastGCN or https://github.com/huangwb/AS-GCN 7to the suggestions [7] for PPI and Reddit. We set the number of partitions for Cora and Pubmed as 10, for ﬂickr as 200 by doing grid search. We set the architecture of GraphSAINT as “0-1-1”3 which means MLP layer followed by two graph convolution layers. We use the “rw” sampling strategy that reported as the best in their original paper to perform the graph sampling procedure. We set the number of root and walk length as the paper suggested. 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5 20.0 Epoch 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation Cora GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN LADIES AS-GCN ClusterGCN GraphSAINT-GCN S-GCN 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5 20.0 Epoch 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90Micro F1 on validation Pubmed GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN LADIES AS-GCN ClusterGCN GraphSAINT-GCN S-GCN 0 20 40 60 80 100 Epoch 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation PPI GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN LADIES AS-GCN ClusterGCN GraphSAINT-GCN S-GCN 2 4 6 8 10 Epoch 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation Reddit GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN LADIES AS-GCN ClusterGCN GraphSAINT-GCN S-GCN 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5 20.0 Epoch 0.350 0.375 0.400 0.425 0.450 0.475 0.500 0.525Micro F1 on validation Flickr GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN LADIES AS-GCN ClusterGCN GraphSAINT-GCN S-GCN 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5 20.0 Epoch 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation Cora GP-BS.M GAT-BS.M GP-BS GAT-BS GraphSAINT-GAT AS-GAT 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5 20.0 Epoch 0.55 0.60 0.65 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90Micro F1 on validation Pubmed GP-BS.M GAT-BS.M GP-BS GAT-BS GraphSAINT-GAT AS-GAT 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Epoch 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation PPI GP-BS.M GAT-BS.M GP-BS GAT-BS GraphSAINT-GAT AS-GAT 2 4 6 8 10 Epoch 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation Reddit GP-BS.M GAT-BS.M GP-BS GAT-BS GraphSAINT-GAT Figure 1: The convergence on validation in terms of epochs. 7.1 Results on Benchmark Data We report the testing results on GCN and attentive GNN architectures in Table 2 and Table 3 respectively. We run the results of each algorithm3 times and report the mean and standard deviation. The results on the two layer GCN architecture show that our GCN-BS performs the best on most of datasets. The results on the two layer attentive GNN architecture show the superiority of our algorithms on training more complex GNN architectures. GraphSAINT or AS-GAT cannot compute the softmax of learned weights, but simply use the unnormalized weights to perform the aggregation. As a result, most of results from AS-GAT and GraphSAINT-GAT in Table 3 are worse than their results in Table 2. Thanks to the power of attentive structures in GNNs, our algorithms perform better results on PPI and Reddit compared with GCN-BS, and signiﬁcantly outperform the results from AS-GAT and GraphSAINT-GAT. 7.2 Convergence In this section, we analyze the convergences of comparison algorithms on the two layer GCN and attentive GNN architectures in Figure 1 in terms of epoch. We run all the algorithms3 times and show the mean and standard deviation. Our approaches consistently converge to better results with faster 3Checkout https://github.com/GraphSAINT/ for more details. 8rates and lower variances in most of datasets like Pubmed, PPI, Reddit and Flickr compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. The GNN-BS algorithms perform very similar to GNN-BS.M, even though strictly speaking GNN-BS does not follow the rigorous MAB setting. Furthermore, we show a huge improvement on the training of attentive GNN architectures compared with GraphSAINT-GAT and AS-GAT. The convergences on validation in terms of timing (seconds), compared with layer sampling approaches, in Appendix C.1 show the similar results. We further give a discussion about timing among layer sampling approaches and graph sampling approaches in Appendix C.2. 3 5 7 10 Sample Size 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Micro F1 on test FastGCN LADIES AS-GCN GraphSAGE S-GCN GCN-BS AS-GAT GP-BS 3 5 7 10 Sample Size 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0Variance FastGCN LADIES AS-GCN GraphSAGE S-GCN GCN-BS AS-GAT GP-BS Figure 2: Comparisons on PPI by varying the sample sizes: ( left) F1 score, (right) sample variances. 7.3 Sample Size Analysis We analyze the sampling variances and accuracy as sample size varies using PPI data. Note that existing layer sampling approaches do not optimize the variances once the samplers are speciﬁed. As a result, their variances are simply ﬁxed [25], while our approaches asymptotically appoach the optimum. For comparison, we train our models until convergence, then compute the average sampling variances. We show the results in Figure 2. The results are grouped into two categories, i.e. results for GCNs and attentive GNNs respectively. The sampling variances of our approaches are smaller in each group, and even be smaller than the variances of S-GCN that leverages a variance reduction solver. This explains the performances of our approaches on testing Micro F1 scores. We also ﬁnd that the overall sampling variances of node-wise approaches are way better than those of layer-wise approaches. 8 Conclusions In this paper, we show that the optimal layer samplers based on importance sampling for training general graph neural networks are computationally intractable, since it needs all the neighbors’ hidden embeddings or learned weights. Instead, we re-formulate the sampling problem as a bandit problem that requires only partial knowledges from neighbors being sampled. We propose two algorithms based on multi-armed bandit and MAB with multiple plays, and show the variance of our bandit sampler asymptotically approaches the optimum within a factor of 3. Furthermore, our algorithms are not only applicable to GCNs but more general architectures like attentive GNNs. We empirically show that our algorithms can converge to better results with faster rates and lower variances compared with state-of-the-art approaches. References [1] P. Auer, N. Cesa-Bianchi, Y .

Proof. Let us denote Qi,Si as the probability of vertex vi choosing any k-element subset Si ⊂Ni from the K-element set Ni using DepRound sampler Qi. This sampler follows the alternative sampling distribution qi = (qij1 ,...,q ijK ) where qijs denotes the alternative probability of sampling neighbor vjs. This sampler is guaranteed to satisfy ∑ Si:j∈Si Qi,Si = qij, i.e. the sum over the probabilities of all subsets Si that contains element jequals the probability qij.

The effective variance can be approximated by Ve(Qi) ≤∑ js∈Ni αijs qijs ∥hjs∥2. Proof. The variance is V(Qi) =E    ∑ js∈Si αijs qijs hjs − ∑ j∈Ni αijhj  2  = ∑ Si⊂Ni Qi,Si  ∑ js∈Si αijs qijs hjs  2 −  ∑ j∈Ni αijhj  2 .

Lemma 1. For any real value constantη≤1 and any valid distributions Qt i and Q⋆ i we have (1 −2η)Vt e(Qt i) −(1 −η)Vt e(Q⋆ i) ≤⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩+ η⟨Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩ (18) Proof. The function Vt e(Q) is convex with respect to Q, hence for any Qt i and Q⋆ i we have Vt e(Qt i) −Vt e(Q⋆ i) ≤⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩. (19) Multiplying both sides of this inequality by 1 −η, we have (1 −η)Vt e(Qt i) −(1 −η)Vt e(Q⋆ i) (20) ≤⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩−η⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩. (21) In the following, we prove this Lemma in our two bandit settings: adversary MAB setting and adversary MAB with multiple plays setting. In adversary MAB setting, we have ⟨Qt i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩= − ∑ j∈Ni qij(t) α2 ij k·qij(t)2 ∥hj(t)∥2 (22) = −Vt e(Qt i) (23) In adversary MAB with multiple plays setting , we use the approximated effective variance∑ js∈Ni αijs qijs ∥hjs∥2 derived in Proposition 2. For notational simplicity, we denote the approxi- mated effective variance as Ve in the following. We have ⟨Qt i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩= − ∑ Si⊂Ni Qt i,Si ∑ js∈Si αijs qijs(t)2 ∥hjs∥2 (24) = − ∑ js∈Ni αijs qijs(t)2 ∥hjs∥2 ∑ Si:js∈Si Qt i,Si (25) = − ∑ js∈Ni αijs qijs(t)∥hjs∥2 (26) = −Vt e(Qt i). (27) The equation (24) holds because of Proposition 3. 14At last, we conclude the proof (1 −η)Vt e(Qt i) −(1 −η)Vt e(Q⋆ i) (28) ≤⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩−η⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩ (29) = ⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩+ η⟨Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩+ ηVt e(Qt i). (30) Theorem 1. Using Algorithm 1 with η= 0.4 and δ = √ (1 −η)η4k5 ln(n/k)/(Tn4) to minimize effective variance with respect to {Qt i}1≤t≤T, we have T∑ t=1 Vt e(Qt i) ≤3 T∑ t=1 Vt e(Q⋆ i) + 10 √ Tn4 ln(n/k) k3 (31) where T ≥ln(n/k)n2(1 −η)/(kη2) and n= |Ni|. Proof. First we explain why condition T ≥ln(n/k)n2(1 −η)/(kη2) ensures that δˆrij(t) ≤1, δˆrij(t) = √ (1 −η)η4k5 ln(n/k) Tn4 ·αij(t) q3 ij(t) ∥hj(t)∥2 (32) ≤ √ (1 −η)η4k5 ln(n/k) Tn4 · n3 k3η3 (33) ≤1 (34) Assuming ∥hj(t)∥≤ 1, inequality (33) holds because αij(t) ≤1 and qij(t) ≥kη/n. Then replace T by the condition, we get δˆrij(t) ≤1. Let Wi(t), W′ i(t) denote ∑ j∈Ni wij(t), ∑ j∈Ni w′ ij(t) respectively. Then for any t= 1,2,...,T , Wi(t+ 1) Wi(t) = ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i wij(t+ 1) Wi(t) + ∑ j∈Ut i wij(t+ 1) Wi(t) (35) = ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i wij(t) Wi(t) ·exp(δˆrij(t)) + ∑ j∈Ut i wij(t) Wi(t) (36) ≤ ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i wij(t) Wi(t) [ 1 +δˆrij(t) + (δˆrij(t))2] + ∑ j∈Ut i wij(t) Wi(t) (37) = 1 +W′ i (t) Wi(t) ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i wij(t) W′ i (t) [ δˆrij(t) + (δˆrij(t))2] (38) = 1 +W′ i (t) Wi(t) ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)/k−η/n 1 −η [ δˆrij(t) + (δˆrij(t))2] (39) ≤1 + δ k(1 −η) ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆrij(t) + δ2 k(1 −η) ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆr2 ij(t) (40) Inequality (37) uses ea ≤1 +a+ a2 for a≤1. Equality (39) holds because of update equation of qij(t) deﬁned in EXP3.M. Inequality (40) holds because W′ i (t) Wi(t) ≤1. Since 1 +x≤ex for x≥0, we have ln Wi(t+ 1) Wi(t) ≤ δ k(1 −η) ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆrij(t) + δ2 k(1 −η) ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆr2 ij(t) (41) 15If we sum, for 1 ≤t≤T, we get the following telescopic sum ln Wi(T + 1) Wi(1) = T∑ t=1 ln Wi(t+ 1) Wi(t) (42) ≤ δ k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆrij(t) + δ2 k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆr2 ij(t) (43) ≤ δ k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆrij(t) + δ2 k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni qij(t)ˆr2 ij(t) (44) On the other hand, for any subset Scontaining k elements, ln Wi(T + 1) Wi(1) ≥ln ∑ j∈S wij(T + 1) Wi(1) (45) ≥ ∑ j∈S ln wij(T + 1) k −ln n k (46) ≥δ k ∑ j∈S ∑ t:j /∈Ut i ˆrij(t) −ln n k (47) The inequality (46) uses the fact that ∑ j∈S wij(T + 1)≥k( ∏ j∈S wij(T + 1))1/k The equation (47) uses the fact that wij(T + 1) = exp(δ ∑ t:j /∈Ut i ˆrij(t)) From (44) and (47), we get δ k ∑ j∈S ∑ t:j /∈Ut i ˆrij(t) −ln n k ≤ δ k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆrij(t) + δ2 k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆr2 ij(t) (48) And we have the following inequality δ k ∑ j∈S ∑ t:j∈Ut i rij(t) = δ k ∑ j∈S ∑ t:j∈Ut i qij(t)ˆrij(t) (49) ≤ δ k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ut i qij(t)ˆrij(t) (50) The equality (49) holds beacuse rij(t) =qijˆrij(t) when j ∈St i and Ut i ⊆St i bacause qt ij = 1for all j ∈Ut i. Then add inequality (50) in (48) we have δ k ∑ j∈S ∑ t:j∈Ut i rij(t) +δ k ∑ j∈S ∑ t:j /∈Ut i ˆrij(t) −ln n k (51) ≤ δ k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni qij(t)ˆrij(t) + δ2 k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni qij(t)ˆr2 ij(t) (52) Given qij(t) we have E[ˆr2 ij(t)] =r2 ij(t)/qij(t), hence, taking expectation of (51) yields that δ k T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈S rij(t) −ln n k ≤ δ k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni qij(t)rij(t) + δ2 k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni r2 ij(t) (53) 16By multiplying (53) by Q⋆ i,S and summing over S, we get δ k T∑ t=1 ∑ S⊂Ni Q⋆ i,S ∑ j∈S rij(t) −ln n k ≤ δ k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni qij(t)rij(t) + δ2 k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni r2 ij(t) (54) As ∑ j∈Ni qij(t)rij(t) = ∑ j∈Ni ∑ Si:j∈Si Qt i,Sirij(t) (55) = ∑ Si⊂Ni Qt i,Si ∑ j∈Si rij(t) (56) = − ∑ Si⊂Ni Qt i,Si∇Qt i,Si Vt e(Qt i,Si) (57) = −⟨Qt i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩ (58) By plugging (58) in (54) and rearranging it, we ﬁnd T∑ t=1 ⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i ,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩+ η T∑ t=1 ⟨Q⋆ i ,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩ (59) ≤δ T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni r2 ij(t) +(1 −η)k δ ln(n/k) Using Lemma 1, we have (1 −2η) T∑ t=1 Vt e(Qt i) −(1 −η) T∑ t=1 Vt e(Q⋆ i ) ≤δ T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni r2 ij(t) +(1 −η)k δ ln(n/k) (60) Finally, we know that ∑ j∈Ni r2 ij(t) = ∑ j∈Ni αij(t)2 qij(t)4 (61) ≤ ∑ j∈Ni αij(t) n4 k4η4 (becauseqij(t) ≥kη/n) (62) = n4 k4η4 (63) By setting η= 0.4 and δ= √ (1 −η)η4k5 ln(n/k)/(Tn4), we get the upper bound. C Experiments C.1 Convergences We show the convergences on validation in terms of timing (seconds) in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Basically, our algorithms converge to much better results in nearly same duration compared with other “layer sampling” approaches. Note that we cannot complete the training of AS-GAT on Reddit because of memory issues. C.2 Discussions on Timings between Layer Sampling and Graph Sampling Paradigms Note that the comparisons of timing between “graph sampling” and “layer sampling” paradigms have been studied recently in [ 7, 24]. As a result, we do not compare the timing with “graph sampling” approaches. Under certain conditions, the graph sampling approaches should be faster than layer sampling approaches. That is, graph sampling approaches are designed for graph data that all vertices have labels. Under such condition, the ﬂoating point operations analyzed in [7] are 170.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 Time 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8Micro F1 on validation Cora GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN AS-GCN LADIES 5 10 15 20 Time 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90Micro F1 on validation Pubmed GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN AS-GCN LADIES 0 1000 2000 3000 Time 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation PPI GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN AS-GCN LADIES 500 1000 1500 Time 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation Reddit GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN AS-GCN LADIES 100 200 300 400 Time 0.40 0.45 0.50Micro F1 on validation Flickr GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN AS-GCN LADIES Figure 3: The convergence in timing (seconds) on GCNs. 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 Time 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8Micro F1 on validation Cora GP-BS.M GP-BS GAT-BS.M GAT-BS AS-GAT 0 10 20 30 Time 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation Pubmed GP-BS.M GP-BS GAT-BS.M GAT-BS AS-GAT 0 1000 2000 Time 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation PPI GP-BS.M GP-BS GAT-BS.M GAT-BS AS-GAT 100 200 300 Time 0.44 0.46 0.48 0.50Micro F1 on validation Flickr GP-BS.M GP-BS GAT-BS.M GAT-BS AS-GAT Figure 4: The convergence in timing (seconds) on attentive GNNs. maximally utilized compared with the “layer sampling” paradigm. However, in practice, there are large amount of graph data with labels only on some types of vertices, such as the graphs in [ 16]. “Graph sampling” approaches are not applicable to cases where only partial vertices have labels. To summarize, the “layer sampling” approaches are more ﬂexible and general compared with “graph sampling” approaches in many cases. C.3 Results on OGB We report our results on OGB protein dataset [13]. We set the learning rate as 1e-3, batch size as 256, the dimension of hidden embeddings as 64, sample size as 10 and epochs as 200. We save the model based on the best results on validation and report results on testing data. We run the experiment 10 times with different random seeds to compute the average and standard deviation of the results. Our result of GP-BS on protein dataset performs the best4 until we submitted this paper. Please ﬁnd our implementations at https://github.com/xavierzw/ogb-geniepath-bs.

        "main_contributions": "Addresses the intractability and suboptimality of existing variance-reduced sampling methods for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly attentive GNNs, where optimal sampling distributions depend on constantly changing and partially unobservable node embeddings and learned weights. The paper formulates the optimization of sampling variance as an adversary bandit problem, allowing adaptation to the dynamic nature of GNN training. It proposes two novel bandit-based sampling algorithms (GNN-BS and GNN-BS.M) applicable to both GCNs and more general attentive GNNs. The theoretical analysis shows that these algorithms asymptotically approach the optimal variance within a factor of 3. Empirically, the approach demonstrates superior convergence speed, higher accuracy (Micro F1 scores), and reduced sample variance compared to state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets.",
        "methodology": "The core methodology involves reformulating the GNN sampling problem as an adversary bandit problem. Rewards are defined as the negative derivatives of the effective sampling variance, which are optimized to reduce the gap to an optimal policy. Two specific algorithms are introduced: GNN-BS, based on the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) setting, where k neighbors are sampled repeatedly and the sampling distribution (policy) is updated using the EXP3 algorithm; and GNN-BS.M, based on the MAB with multiple plays setting, which uses an efficient k-combination sampler (DepRound) to select a k-element subset of neighbors at once, updating its policy using EXP3.M. For GNN-BS.M, an unbiased estimator is established, and the effective variance is approximated using Jensen's inequality for reward calculation. The methodology also includes an extension for attentive GNNs by defining adjusted feedback attention values to handle dynamically changing attention coefficients.",
        "experimental_setup": "The proposed algorithms were extensively evaluated on five public benchmark datasets: Cora, Pubmed, PPI, Reddit, and Flickr, utilizing standard data splits. Additional results were reported on the OGB protein dataset. Experiments were conducted using 2-layer GCN, GAT, and GeniePath (GP) architectures. Hidden embedding dimensions were set to 16 for Cora/Pubmed, 256 for PPI/Reddit/Flickr, and 64 for OGB protein. Hyperparameters, including learning rate, L2-norm regularizers, and dropout rate, were tuned via grid search. Sample sizes (k) for our algorithms, GraphSAGE, and S-GCN varied by dataset (e.g., 1 for Cora/Pubmed, 10 for PPI/Reddit), while layer-specific sample sizes were used for FastGCN/AS-GCN/AS-GAT. Batch sizes were typically 256. Comparisons were made against various layer sampling methods (GraphSAGE, FastGCN, LADIES, AS-GCN, S-GCN) and graph sampling techniques (ClusterGCN, GraphSAINT), as well as attentive GNN baselines (AS-GAT, GraphSAINT-GAT). Performance was measured using Micro F1 scores on test sets, with convergence rates and sample variances also analyzed. Experiments were run multiple times (3 for benchmarks, 10 for OGB) to report statistical averages and standard deviations.",
        "limitations": "The current derivation of the bandit samplers primarily aligns with node-wise sampling, and its rigorous extension to layer-wise sampling approaches is noted as future work. The GNN-BS algorithm, while empirically effective, does not strictly adhere to the rigorous multi-armed bandit setting by repeatedly selecting a single arm 'k' times before updating the policy, instead of making a single 'k'-element action. The paper's formulation of the bandit problem is specifically within the adversarial bandit setting, leaving the exploration of other bandit settings (e.g., stochastic bandits) as future research. Additionally, the effective variance for the GNN-BS.M algorithm relies on an approximation derived using Jensen's inequality.",
        "future_research_directions": "Future research directions include extending the bandit sampler framework to rigorously support layer-wise sampling approaches for Graph Neural Networks. Another suggested direction is to investigate the application and performance of the sampling problem under other bandit settings beyond the adversarial bandit framework, such as stochastic multi-armed bandits.",

Introductions Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great suc- cess across different graph-related tasks (Hamilton et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2020; Ying et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022; 2023). However, despite its effective- ness, the training of GNNs is very time-consuming. Specifi- cally, GNNs are characterized by an interleaved execution that switches between the aggregation and update phases. Namely, in the aggregation phase, every node aggregates messages from its neighborhoods at each layer, which is implemented based on sparse matrix-based operations (Fey & Lenssen, 2019; Wang et al., 2019). In the update phase, each node will update its embedding based on the aggre- gated messages, where the update function is implemented with dense matrix-based operations (Fey & Lenssen, 2019; Wang et al., 2019). In Figure 1, SpMM and MatMul are the sparse and dense operations in the aggregation and update phases, respectively. Through profiling, we found that the aggregation phase may take more than 90% running time for GNN training. This is because the sparse matrix opera- tions in the aggregation phase have many random memory accesses and limited data reuse, which is hard to be acceler- ated by community hardwares (e.g., CPUs and GPUs) (Duan et al., 2022b; Han et al., 2016; Duan et al., 2022a). Thus, training GNNs with large graphs is often time-inefficient. ognb-proteins Reddit ogbn-product0 20 40 60 80 100Percentage of Time Consumption Other MatMul(forward) MatMul(backward) SpMM(forward) SpMM(backward) Figure 1: The time profiling of a two-layer GCNs on dif- ferent datasets. SpMM may take 70% ∼ 90% of the total time. We measure the time on a single NVIDIA RTX3090 (24GB). The detailed software and hardware information can be found in Appendix D. Existing works towards this problem can be roughly divided into three categories. First, some works propose distributed GNNs training systems, which focus on minimizing the 1 arXiv:2210.10737v2  [cs.LG]  2 Jul 2023RSC: Accelerate Graph Neural Networks Training via Randomized Sparse Computations communication cost among hardware (Zheng et al., 2020; Ramezani et al., 2022; Wan et al., 2022b; Md et al., 2021; Wan et al., 2022a). Second, another research line optimizes the memory access pattern of sparse operations via coalesc- ing the memory access and fusing consecutive operations (Zhang et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2020a; Rahman et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021). Third, some other works try to accelerate the training process from the optimization aspect, i.e., using fewer iterations to converge (Narayanan et al., 2022; Cong et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2021; Cai et al., 2021). In parallel, an orthogonal direction is to replace the ex- pensive operations with their faster-approximated versions (Adelman et al., 2021; Drineas et al., 2006b). The key idea is to sub-sample tensors onto low dimensional spaces and perform the original operations here. For example, for the linear operation between two matrices A ∈ Rn×m and B ∈ Rm×q, we first obtain A′ ∈ Rn×k and B′ ∈ Rk×q (k < m) by picking k representative columns of A and the corresponding rows of B (Drineas et al., 2006b). Then we approximate AB ≈ A′B′. With this procedure, the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) and memory access are both reduced. Based on the idea, previous work success- fully accelerates the dense matrix based operations, such as convolution and linear operations (Adelman et al., 2021). The approximated operation can plug-and-play replace the exact operation to improve per-operation efficiency, and thus is compatible with most of the efficient training methods. Despite the potential, this perspective however has not been explored for the sparse operations in GNNs. The approximation method reduces the computational com- plexity at the cost of giving noisy outputs. Thus, there naturally exists an accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Com- pared to approximating dense matrix operations, there are two unique challenges to optimizing the trade-off for ap- proximated sparse operations. First, unlike the previous example of approximating linear operation, k cannot di- rectly control the efficiency (FLOPs) for sparse operations. This is because, for dense matrices, each row/column has the same amount of parameters. Thus the reduction of FLOPs in approximated dense operations is determined by the dimensions of the sub-sampled matrices (i.e., k). How- ever, in sparse operations, each row/column in the sparse adjacency matrix has different numbers of non-zero en- tries, and the computation is only executed on non-zero entries (i.e., irregular data format). Thus, the reduction of FLOPs in the sparse operations is decided by the selection of representative rows/columns. It lacks a mechanism to directly control the efficiency-accuracy trade-off for each sparse operation. Second, compared to the dense counter- part, sub-sampling (i.e., slicing) the sparse matrix is much more time-consuming due to its irregular data format (Han et al., 2016; Fey & Lenssen, 2019), which counteracts the acceleration from the FLOPs reduction. To this end, we propose Randomized Sparse Computation, dubbed RSC , the first approximation framework tailored for efficient GNN training. Our core idea is to control the trade-off by optimizing the computation resource alloca- tion at the “global” level. Specifically, to tackle the first challenge, at the layer-wise level, we propose to customize the FLOPs of each sparse operation while limiting the total FLOPs under a certain budget. The rationale behind this strategy is that each operation may have a different contribu- tion to the model accuracy. Thus, we could to assign more computational resources to “important” operations under a certain budget. More concretely, we frame it as a constraint optimization problem. Then we propose a greedy algorithm to solve it efficiently. To tackle the second challenge, at the epoch-wise level, we found that the selection of represen- tative row/columns tends to remain similar across nearby iterations. Based on this finding, we develop a caching mechanism to reuse the previously sampled sparse matrix across nearby iterations to reduce per-epoch sampling time. Finally, inspired by the recent finding that the final stage of training usually needs smaller noise to help convergence (Li et al., 2019; Dao et al., 2022), we propose to use approxi- mated sparse operation during most of the training process, while switching back to the original sparse operation at the final stage. This switching mechanism significantly reduces the accuracy drop, at the cost of slightly less speedup. We summarize our contributions as follows: • We accelerate the training of GNNs from a new perspec- tive, namely, replacing the expensive sparse operations with their faster-approximated versions. • Instead of focusing on balancing the efficiency-accuracy trade-off at the operation level, we control the trade-off through optimizing resource allocation at the layer-wise and epoch-wise levels. • We propose a caching mechanism to reduce the cost of sampling sparse matrices by reusing previous results. • Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effective- ness of the proposed method. Particularly, RSC can achieve up to 11.6× speedup for a single sparse opera- tion and a 1.6× end-to-end wall-clock time speedup with negligible (≈ 0.3%) accuracy drop. 2. Background and Preliminary 2.1. Graph Neural Networks Let G = ( V, E) be an undirected graph with V = (v1, ··· , v|V|) and E = (e1, ··· , e|E|) being the set of nodes and edges, respectively. Let X ∈ R|V|×d be the node feature matrix. A ∈ R|V|×|V| is the graph adjacency matrix, where Ai,j = 1 if (vi, vj) ∈ Eelse Ai,j = 0. 2RSC: Accelerate Graph Neural Networks Training via Randomized Sparse Computations ˜A = ˜D−1 2 (A + I) ˜D−1 2 is the normalized adjacency ma- trix, where ˜D is the degree matrix of A + I. GNNs re- cursively update the embedding of a node by aggregating embeddings of its neighbors. For example, the forward pass of the lth Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) layer (Kipf & Welling, 2017) can be defined as: H(l+1) = ReLU( ˜AH(l)Θ(l)), (1) where H(l) is the node embedding matrix at the lth layer and H(0) = X. Θ(l) is the weight matrix of the lth layer. In practice, ˜A is often stored in the sparse matrix format, e.g., compressed sparse row (CSR) (Fey & Lenssen, 2019). From the implementation aspect, the computation of Equa- tion (1) can be described as: H(l+1) = ReLU   SpMM \u0012 ˜A, MatMul(H(l), Θ(l)) \u0013! , where SpMM(·, ·) is the Sparse-Dense Matrix Multiplica- tion and MatMul(·, ·) is the Dense Matrix Multiplication. Sparse operations, such as SpMM , have many random mem- ory accesses and limited data reuse. Thus they are much slower than the dense counterpart (Han et al., 2016; Duan et al., 2022b). To get a sense of the scale, we show in Figure 1 that for GCNs, SpMM may take roughly 70% ∼ 90% of the total training time. 2.2. Fast Approximated MatMul with Sampling Let X ∈ Rn×m, Y ∈ Rm×q. The goal is to efficiently esti- mate the matrix production XY . Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) outputs provably optimal low-rank estimation of XY (Adelman et al., 2021). However, SVD is almost as expensive as matrix production itself. Instead, the sampling algorithm is proposed to approximate the matrix product XY by sampling k columns of X and correspond- ing rows of Y to form smaller matrices, which are then multiplied as usual (Drineas et al., 2006b). This algorithm reduces the computational complexity from O(mnq) to O(knq). Specifically, XY = mX i=1 X:,iYi,: ≈ kX t=1 1 st X:,itYit,: = approx(XY ), (2) where X:,i ∈ Rn×1 and Yi,: ∈ R1×q are the ith column and row of X and Y , respectively. In this paper, we call (X:,i, Yi,:) the ith column-row pair. k is the number of sam- ples (1 ≤ k ≤ m). {pi}m i=1 is a probability distribution over the column-row pairs. it ∈ {1, ··· m} is the index of the sampled column-row pair at the tth trial. st is the scale fac- tor. Theoretically, (Drineas et al., 2006b) shows that if we set st = 1 kpit , then we have E[approx(XY )] =XY . Fur- ther, the approximation errorE[||XY −approx(XY )||F ] is minimized when the sampling probabilities {pi}m i=1 are proportional to the product of the column-row Euclidean norms (Drineas et al., 2006b): pi = ||X:,i||2 ||Yi,:||2Pm j=1 ||X:,j||2 ||Yj,:||2 . (3) 2.2.1. T OP-k SAMPLING The above sampling-based method is originally developed for accelerating the general application ofMatMul (Drineas et al., 2006b). Directly applying it to neural networks may be sub-optimal since it does not consider the characteristic of neural network weights. Based on the empirical observation that the distribution of weights remains centered around zero during training (Glorot & Bengio, 2010; Han et al., 2015), (Adelman et al., 2021) proposes a top-k sampling algorithm: Picking k column-row pairs with the largest ||X:,i||2 ||Yi,:||2Pm j=1 ||X:,j||2 ||Yj,:||2 deterministically without scaling. Equivalently, it means pi of column-row pairs with the k- largest value in Equation (3) equals 1, otherwise it equals 0. And sit is a constant 1. Albeit without the scaling while sampling column-row pairs deterministically, under on the assumption of zero-centered weight distribution, (Adelman et al., 2021) theoretically show that top-k sampling still yields an unbiased estimation of XY with minimal approx- imation error. Consequently, the top-k sampling algorithm empirically shows a significantly lower accuracy drop when approximating the convolution and linear operations in the neural networks (Adelman et al., 2021). In the next section, we explore how to approximate the expensive sparse operation via the top-k sampling. 3. The Proposed Framework The overview of RSC is shown in Figure 2, where we use the computation graph of GCN as an example. We first explore which SpMM in the computation graph can be re- placed with its approximated version (Section 3.1). Then since GNNs have multiple SpMM and each of them may have different importance to the model performance, we then automatically allocate computation resources to dif- ferent SpMM (Section 3.2). Finally, we explore two simple and effective tricks for improvingRSC , including a caching mechanism to reduce the overhead of sampling sparse ma- trices (Section 3.3.1) and a switching mechanism to reduce the accuracy drop (Section 3.3.2). 3.1. Where to Apply the Approximation 3.1.1. E XPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS Each sparse operation is executed twice at each train- ing step, i.e., one in the forward pass and the other one 3RSC: Accelerate Graph Neural Networks Training via Randomized Sparse Computations SPMM MatMul Approx SpMM MatMul Forward Pass Backward Pass Down Sampl ing Cache Caching (Sec 3.3.1) Down Sampl ing Constraint  Optimization Eq. 5 𝑘!

RSC only replace the SpMM in the backward pass with its approximated version using top-k sampling (Section 3.1). kl is the number of samples for top-k sampling at the lth layer, which is automatically allocated (Section 3.2). To reduce the overhead of sampling, we also cache the sampled graph and reuse it across nearby iterations (Section 3.3). in the backward pass. As shown in Figure 2, here we take SpMM in the lth GCN layer as an example, the for- ward one is H(l+1) = ReLU(SpMM( ˜A, J(l))), where J(l) = MatMul(H(l), Θ(l)) is the intermediate node representations. And the backward one is ∇J(l) = SpMM( ˜A⊤, ∇H(l+1)). ∇J(l) and ∇H(l) are the gradient with respect to J(l) and H(l), respectively. Even though the approximation method itself is statisti- cally unbiased, replacing the exact sparse operation with their faster-approximated versions still injects noise to the computation graph. As we analyzed above, each SpMM is executed twice in the training step. Below we first exper- imentally analyze the impact of the injected noise in the forward pass and the backward pass. As shown in Table 1, we apply top-k sampling to approximate the SpMM in the forward pass, backward pass, or both, respectively. Table 1: Preliminary results on approximatingSpMM via top- k sampling. The model is a two-layer GCN, and the dataset is Reddit. Here we set thek as 0.1|V| across different layers. Method Reddit without approximation 95.39±0.04 only forward 16.45±0.39 only backward 95.25±0.03 forward and backward 80.74±1.00 From Table 1, the accuracy drop is negligible if we only replace SpMM in the backward pass. Notably, if we apply ap- proximation in both the forward and backward pass, the re- sult is significantly better than only applying top-k sampling in the forward pass. The reason is that when only apply- ing approximation in the forward pass, some row/columns are not included in the computation graph, so intuitively these row/columns should be excluded in the backward pass. “forward and backward” result in Table 1 is built based on this intuition such that in the backward pass, we use the column-row pairs sampled in the forward pass to compute the gradient (Adelman et al., 2021). However, it is still not comparable to the result of applying approximation only in the backward pass. Below we mathematically analyze the reason behind the results in Table 1. 3.1.2. T HEORETICAL ANALYSIS We first analyze the case of approximating the sparse opera- tions in the forward pass. Namely, replacingSpMM( ˜A, J(l)) with approx( ˜AJ(l)). We note that we have E[f(x)] ̸= f(E[x]) for any non-linear function f(·), e.g., E[x2] ̸= E2[x]. Thus, even when the approximation method gives an unbiased estimation, i.e., E[approx( ˜AJ(l))] = ˜AJ(l), the node embeddings H(l+1) are still biased since the acti- vation function is non-linear. To see this, E[H(l+1)] =E[ReLU(approx( ˜AJ(l))]) ̸= ReLU(E[approx( ˜AJ(l))]) =H(l+1). Thus, if we apply the approximation for the SpMM in the forward pass, the bias will be propagated layer-by-layer and cause significantly worse results. For the case of only approximating the sparse operation in the backward pass, we have the following proposition: Proposition 3.1 (Proof in Appendix A). If the approxima- tion method is itself unbiased, and we only replace theSpMM in the backward pass with its approximated version, while leaving the forward one unchanged, then the calculated gradient is provably unbiased. The high-level idea is that the gradient of the activation function in the backward pass is only related to the pre- activations in the forward pass, and thus is independent of the approximation error introduced in the backward pass. Due to the page limit, we also discuss why sampling-based approximation is suitable for accelerating GNNs in Ap- pendix A. As suggested by our theoretical and empirical analysis, as shown in Figure 2, we only approximate the sparse operations in the backward pass, while leaving all other operations unchanged. 3.2. How to Apply the Approximation As we mentioned, for sparse operations, the acceleration is decided by the selection of sampled column-row pairs. To see this, as shown in Figure 3, suppose we use top- k sampling to approximate SpMM( ˜A⊤, ∇H). Since the computations are only executed on the non-zero entries, so selecting the orange pairs (i.e., pair 1 and 3) will result in 3 7 × less computational cost (FLOPs) compared to selecting 4RSC: Accelerate Graph Neural Networks Training via Randomized Sparse Computations 1 11 111111132100123 3210∇𝐻!!∇𝐻!\"∇𝐻!#∇𝐻\"! ∇𝐻#!∇𝐻$! ∇𝐻\"\" ∇𝐻#\"∇𝐻$\" ∇𝐻\"# ∇𝐻##∇𝐻$# Nodeembeddinggradients∇𝐻∈ℝ!×#,with𝑑=3Sparseadjacencymatrix𝐴$∈ℝ!×!,with𝑁=4 × Figure 3: For approximated sparse operations, the accelera- tion is decided by the selection of column-row pairs. the blue pair (i.e., pair 0 and 2). For both the orange and blue cases, we have k = 2. Thus, the number of samples k cannot directly constrain the FLOPs for each individual operation. Moreover, a GNN has multiple operations (or layers), and the model accuracy has a different sensitivity to the approximation error at different layers. To optimize the accuracy-efficiency trade-off, our key idea is to customize the computation resources (i.e., FLOPs) for each layer by adjusting the number of samples kl in the l-th layer. In this way, we minimize the impact of approximation, while limiting the overall FLOPs under a certain budget. Based on the idea, we frame the resource allocation problem as the following constrained optimization problem: min {kl} − LX l=1 X i∈Topkl ∥ ˜A⊤ :,i∥2∥∇H(l+1) i,: ∥2 ∥ ˜A∥F ∥∇H(l+1)∥F , (4a) s.t. LX l=1 X i∈Topkl #nnzi ∗ dl ≤ C LX i=1 |E|dl, (4b) where C is the budget (0 < C <1) that controls the overall reduced FLOPs. kl is the number of samples for the top-k sampling at the l-th layer. dl is the hidden dimensions ofl-th layer, and #nnzi is the number of non-zero entries at the i-th column of ˜A⊤. Topkl is the set of indices associated with the kl largest ∥ ˜A⊤ :,i∥2∥∇H(l+1) i,: ∥2. Equation (4a) is equivalent to minimizing the relative ap- proximation error E[|| ˜A⊤∇H(l+1)−approx( ˜A⊤∇H(l+1))||F ∥ ˜A∥F ∥∇H(l+1)||F ] summarized over all layers (Adelman et al., 2021). Also, different sparse operations are weighted summation by the magnitude of gradient ∥∇H(l+1)∥2, which implicitly en- codes the importance of different operations. Equation (4b) is the constraint that controls the overall FLOPs. Specifically, the FLOPs of SpMM between ˜A and the gradient ∇H ∈ RN×d is O(|E|d) and P j∈V #nnzj = |E|. We note that Equation (4b) also bounds the number of memory access of SpMM . 3.2.1. GREEDY SOLUTION The above combination optimization objective is NP-hard, albeit it can be solved by dynamic programming. However, dynamic programming is very slow, which somehow con- tradicts our purpose of being efficient. Thus, we propose to use a greedy algorithm to solve it. Specifically, it starts with the highest kl = |V| for all layers. In each move, it chooses a kl among {kl}L l=1 to reduce by a step size (e.g., 0.02|V|), such that the increment of errors in Equation (4a) is mini- mal. The greedy algorithm will stop when the current total FLOPs fits in the budget in Equation (4b). This algorithm runs super fast, and we found that it has minimal impact on efficiency. We provide the pseudo-code of our greedy algorithm in Algorithm 1 of Appendix B. 3.3. When to Apply the Approximation 3.3.1. CACHE THE SAMPLED SPARSE MATRICES We first give the details about the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format for representing the sparse matrix here. CSR stores nonzero values in a matrix and their position in three arrays: index array Rowptr, column array Col, and value array Val. The elements in Rowptr act as the starting indices of the elements in Col and Val that correspond to each row. Specifically, the elements of row i are stored in indices Rowptr[i] to Rowptr[i+ 1] − 1 of Col and Val . The elements in Col and Val are the column index and value in that column, respectively. Figure 5 shows the CSR format of the matrix shown in Figure 3. We ignore the Val array here for illustration convenience. Executing the top- k sampling contains two steps: First, it decides the indices corresponding to the top- k largest column row norms in Equation (3). Second, slicing the matrices according to the indices. In practice, the overhead of the first step can be ignored. However, unlike dense matrices, slicing the adjacency matrix is much slower due to its irregular data format. To see this, suppose the top-k indices of the sparse matrix in Figure 3 correspond to the orange column-row pairs. Figure 5 shows the process of slicing the adjacency matrix in CSR format by reserving only the orange columns. Slicing sparse matrices requires to re-process the graph to build the new Rowptr and Col (Fey & Lenssen, 2019), which introduces significant time overhead, especially for large graphs. For the full graph training, we use the same adjacency matrix across different epochs1. We made a crucial observation that the top-k indices in the adjacency matrix tend to be the same across iterations. In Figure 4, we plot the AUC score of top- k indices between every iteration t and iteration t + 10for 1For sub-graph based training, we can first sample all of the sub-graphs offline. Then during the training, we apply the caching mechanism to each sampled graph. 5RSC: Accelerate Graph Neural Networks Training via Randomized Sparse Computations 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Epochs 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Matching score Reddit GCN 1st layer GCN 2nd layer GraphSAGE 1st layer GraphSAGE 2nd layer 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Epochs 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Matching score Yelp GCN 1st layer GCN 2nd layer GraphSAGE 1st layer GraphSAGE 2nd layer 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Epochs 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Matching score ogbn-proteins GCN 1st layer GCN 2nd layer GraphSAGE 1st layer GraphSAGE 2nd layer Figure 4: For each layer, the selected column-row pairs tend to be very similar across iterations.

Figure 5: The process of slicing the sparse matrix in Figure 3 by only reserving orange columns (in CSR format). each layer throughout the whole training process. Here we note that AUC score is a commonly used ranking measure and a 1.0 AUC score means the ranking of column-row pairs is identical across iterations. The results in Figure 4 indicate that the top-k indices won’t change significantly within a few iterations. Thus, as shown in Figure 2, we propose to reuse the sampled adjacency matrix for each layer across nearby iterations. Discussion. The rationale behind the success of caching is the slow rate of change in the learned embeddings within GNNs (Fey et al., 2021; Wan et al., 2022a). Prior research has leveraged this “staleness” of embeddings to enhance the efficiency of GNN training [1, 2]. The success of caching can also be explained by the staleness: if embeddings (and their gradients) across consecutive steps remain nearly iden- tical, the sampled sparse matrix will also exhibit minimal variation. Later we experimentally show that the caching mechanism does not impact the model performance a lot, but leads to a significant speedup. 3.3.2. SWITCH BACK AT THE END When training neural networks, the common practice is to use a large learning rate for exploration and anneal to a small one for final convergence (Li et al., 2019). The ratio- nale behind this strategy is that, at the end of the training process, we need to fine-tune our model with small noise for convergence. Since our approximation sparse operations will bring extra noise to the gradient, intuitively, we can switch back to the original sparse operations to help con- vergence. More formally, we propose to use approximated sparse operation during most of the training process, while switching back to the original sparse operation at the final stage. We experimentally show that this switching mecha- nism significantly reduces the accuracy drop at the cost of slightly less acceleration effect. We note that the switching mechanism is not proposed in this paper. The switching mechanism takes inspiration from previous work Dao et al. (2022), and both our work and Dao et al. (2022) utilize the switching mechanism to minimize the impact of approximation. 4. Related work and Discussion Due to the page limit, we first discuss the related work on approximated matrix multiplication. Other related topics, i.e., subgraph-based training, randomized GNN training, and non-approximated GNN acceleration, can be found in Appendix C. Approximated Matrix Multiplication.The approximated matrix production can be roughly divided into three cat- egories. However, only a few of them can be used for accelerating GNN training. Specifically, (1) Random walk- based methods (Cohen & Lewis, 1999) performs random walks on a graph representation of the dense matrices, but is only applicable to non-negative matrices; (2) Butterfly- based methods (Chen et al., 2021; Dao et al., 2022) replace dense matrices with butterfly matrices. It is not applicable to SpMM in GNNs because the adjacency matrix often cannot be reduced to a butterfly matrix. (3) Column-row sampling methods(Drineas et al., 2006a; Drineas & Kannan, 2001) sample the input matrices with important rows and columns, then perform the production on the sampled matrix as usual. 5. Limitations First, to guarantee the model accuracy, we only replace the sparse operation in the backward pass. Thus the upper bound of RSC ’s speedup is limited. However, we note that the backward pass usually is more time-consuming than the forward pass, which is also empirically shown in Table 2. Second, some GNNs rely on the scatter-and-gather instead of SpMM (and its variant) to perform the aggregation, such as GAT (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2017). They are not covered in this paper. However, scatter-and-gather based GNNs can also 6RSC: Accelerate Graph Neural Networks Training via Randomized Sparse Computations be accelerated by RSC because the column-row sampling is also applicable to scatter and gather operation. Similarly, the caching and switching mechanisms are also applicable to them. However, for the resource allocation Algorithm 1, the scatter and gather operations require tailored error bound and the computation cost modeling in Equation (4). We leave it as future work. 6. Experiments We verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework via answering the following research questions: Q1: How ef- fective is RSC in terms of accuracy with reduced training time? Q2: How effective is our proposed allocation strategy compared to the uniform allocation strategy? Q3: What is the layer-wise ratio assigned by RSC ? Q4: How effec- tive is the caching and switching mechanism in terms of the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy? If without explicitly mentioned, all reported results are averaged over ten random trials 6.1. Experimental Settings Datasets and Baselines. To evaluateRSC , we adopt four common large-scale graph benchmarks from different do- mains, i.e., Reddit (Hamilton et al., 2017), Yelp (Zeng et al., 2020), ogbn-proteins (Hu et al., 2020), and ogbn- products (Hu et al., 2020). We evaluate RSC under both the mini-batch training and full-batch training settings. For the mini-batch training setting, we integrate RSC with one of the state-of-the-art sampling methods, GraphSAINT (Zeng et al., 2020). For the full-batch training setting, we inte- grate RSC with three popular models: two commonly used shallow models, namely, GCN (Kipf & Welling, 2017) and GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017), and one deep model GCNII (Chen et al., 2020). To avoid creating confusion, GCN, GraphSAGE, and GCNII are all trained with the whole graph at each step. For a fair comparison, we use the MEAN aggregator for GraphSAGE and GraphSAINT throughout the paper. Details about the hyperparameters and datasets are in Appendix D. Hyperparameter settings. RSC contains three parts. First, the allocation strategy. We choose the overall budget C in Equation (4b) from {0.1, 0.3, 0.5}. We run the resource allocation strategy every ten steps. The step size α in Algo- rithm 1 is set as 0.02|V|. Second, the caching mechanism. According to Figure 4, we sample the adjacency matrix every ten steps and reuse the sampled matrices for nearby steps. Third, the switching mechanism, where we apply RSC for 80% of the total epochs, while switching back to the original operations for the rest of the 20% epochs. Due to the page limit, We present a detailed hyperparameter study in Appendix E Figure 11 and Figure 12. Evaluation metrics. To evaluate the practical usage of RSC , we report the wall clock time speedup measured on GPUs. Specifically, the speedup equalsTbaseline/Trsc, where Tbaseline and Trsc are the wall clock training time of baseline and RSC , respectively. We note that the Trsc includes the running time of the greedy algorithm, and the effects of caching and switching. 6.2. Performance Analysis 6.2.1. A CCURACY -EFFICIENCY TRADE -OFF To answer Q1, we summarize the speedup and the test accuracy/F1-micro/AUC of different methods in Table 3. Since RSC accelerates the sparse operation in the backward pass, we also provide the detailed efficiency analysis in Table 2. In summary, we observe: ❶ At the operation level, RSC can accelerate the sparse operation in the backward pass by up to 11.6×. For end- to-end training, the accuracy drop of applying RSC over baselines is negligible (0.3%) across different models and datasets, while achieving up to 1.6× end-to-end wall clock time speedup. The gap between the operation speedup and the end-to-end speedup is due to the following two reasons. First, we focus on accelerating the sparse computations in GNNs, which is the unique bottleneck to GNNs. The other dense computations can certainly be accelerated by approximation methods, but this is beyond the scope of this paper. Second, we only accelerate the sparse computation in the backward pass instead of the forward one to guaran- tee performance. We note that for approximation methods that accelerate the training process at operation level, a 1.2 ≈ 1.3× wall-clock speedup with negligible accuracy drop can be regarded as non-trivial (for details, please see Table 1 in (Adelman et al., 2021)), especially considering that these approximation methods are orthogonal to most of the existing efficient training methods. For GraphSAINT, the speedup of RSC is around 1.1×, which is smaller than the full graph training. This is because for subgraph-based training, the equivalent “batch size” is much smaller than the full graph counterparts. As a result, the GPU utility is low since it does not assign each processor a sufficient amount of work and the bottleneck is the mini-batch transfer time (Kaler et al., 2022). We note that the mini-batch sampling and transfer time can be optimized from the system perspec- tive (Kaler et al., 2022), which is orthogonal to our work. The speedup is expected to be larger when the mini-batch sampling time is optimized. 6.2.2. A BLATION ON RESOURCE ALLOCATION . Due to the page limit, we first show the running time of the greedy algorithm in Appendix E Table 11. We conclude that the overhead of the greedy algorithm is negligible com- pared to the acceleration effect of RSC .

As shown in Figure 6, we plot the Pareto frontier of the accuracy-efficiency trade-off on the Reddit dataset for RSC and the uniform strategy with different C. For a fair comparison, we disabled the caching and switching mechanism. Due to page limit, more results are shown in Appendix E. We observe that: ❷ RSC exhibits a supe- rior trade-off between accuracy and efficiency compared to the uniform allocation, especially under high speedup regime. Namely, compared to the uniform allocation, RSC can achieve higher model accuracy under the same speedup. This can be explained by the fact that each operation has a different importance to the model performance. RSC can au- tomatically allocate more resources to important operations under a given total budget. To answer Q3, due to the page limit, we visualize the al- located kl for each layer across iterations in Appendix E Figure 7, and the degree of picked nodes in Appendix E Figure 8. We observe: ❸ The kl assigned by RSC evolves along with the training. 6.2.3. A BLATION ON CACHING AND SWITCHING . In section 6.2.2, we have shown the superior results of the proposed resource allocation strategy. As we mentioned in Section 3.3, we also introduce two simple tricks to for improving RSC , i.e., the caching and switching mechanism. To verify the effect of each of them (Q4), we conduct incre- mental evaluations on GCN, GraphSAGE and GCNII with 8RSC: Accelerate Graph Neural Networks Training via Randomized Sparse Computations ogbn-proteins, which are summarized in Table 4. The row without caching and switching in Table 4 corresponds to the results with the proposed resource allocation strategy. We observe: ❹ Switching mechanism significantly improves the model performance, at the cost of slightly less acceleration effect. As we analyzed in Section 3.3.2, the improvement can be explained by the fact that the final training stage requires smaller gradient noise to help convergence. ❺ Caching mechanism significantly improves the wall-clock time speedup, at the cost of worse model performance. Al- though caching mechanism can reduce the overhead of sam- pling, the performance drop is too large (> 1%). Intuitively, the accuracy drop of caching also implies that we could not use a “static” down-sampled graph throughout the training process. ❻ Surprisingly, jointly applying the caching and switching, the performance drop can be minimized. 7.

Conclusions and Future work We propose RSC , which replaces the sparse computations in GNNs with their fast approximated versions. RSC can be plugged into most of the existing training frameworks to improve their efficiency. Future work includes exploring RSC for GNNs that rely on scatter-and-gather operations.

Layer-dependent importance sampling for training deep and large graph convolutional networks. arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.07323, 2019. 12RSC: Accelerate Graph Neural Networks Training via Randomized Sparse Computations A. Mathematical Analysis A.1. Why Sampling-based Approximation for GNN? In the main text, we mentioned SpMM is the main speed bottleneck for GNNs. Below we illustrate why the column- row sampling is suitable for accelerating SpMM in GNNs, from the approximation error perspective. Here we analyze ˜AJ(l) = SpMM( ˜A, J(l)) for illustration convenience. For the backward pass of SpMM , the analysis is similar, except that we are approximating ∇J(l) = SpMM( ˜A⊤, ∇H(l+1)). Column-row sampling approximates the matrix production by excluding some “unimportant” columns and rows in the original matrix. So intuitively, the approximation error E[|| ˜AJ(l) − approx( ˜AJ(l))||F ] is low if the “unimportant” columns/rows are correlated in the selected one. Namely, ˜A and J(l) are low-rank. Formally, we have the following theorem: Theorem A.1 ((Martinsson & Tropp, 2020)) . Suppose we approximate ˜AJ(l) using column-row sampling, and pi is obtained by Equation (3). Then for any positive number ϵ, if the number of samples k satisfies k ≥ ϵ−2(srank( ˜A) + srank(J(l))) log(|V| + d), we have E[|| ˜AJ(l) − approx( ˜AJ(l))||F ] ≤ 2ϵ, where srank in Theorem A.1 is called the stable rank, which is the continuous surrogate measure for the rank that is largely unaffected by tiny singular values. Formally for any matrix Y , srank(Y ) =||Y ||2 F ||Y ||2 ≤ rank(Y ). Fortunately, most real-world graphs are cluster-structured, which means the adjacency matrix ˜A is low-rank (Qiu et al., 2021; Savas & Dhillon, 2011). The low-rank property of real-world graphs is also wildly reported in previous work (Jin et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2021). Moreover, the intermediate activations J(l) and the activation gradients are also low-rank, due to the aggregation. Namely, low-rank means “correlation” in the row/column space. The embedding (i.e., rows in the activation matrix) of connected nodes tend to close due to the graph propagation, which resulting in the low-rank property of the activation matrix. Thus for GNNs, the approximation error is low with a relatively small number of sample k. This perspective is also experimentally verified in the experiment section. A.2. Proof of Proposition 1 Proposition A.2 (Proof in Appendix A). If the approximation method is itself unbiased, and we only replace the SpMM in the backward pass with its approximated version, while leaving the forward one unchanged, then the calculated gradient is provably unbiased. Here we note that in the main text, for the notation convenience, we ignore the backward pass of ReLU. However, the proof here will consider the non-linear activation function to prove the unbiasedness. Let H(l+1) pre = SpMM( ˜A, J(l)) be the pre-activation. The backward pass of ReLU is: E[∇H(l+1) pre ] =E[1 H(l+1) pre >0 ⊙ ∇H(l+1)] = 1 H(l+1) pre >0 ⊙ E[∇H(l+1)], (5) where ⊙ is the element-wise product and 1 is the indicator function. The element-wise product is linear operation and 1 H(l+1) pre >0 is only related to the pre-activation in the forward pass, we only apply the approximation during the backward pass so 1 H(l+1) pre >0 can be extracted from the expectation. We know that for the last layer, we have E[∇H(L)] = H(L) since we do not apply ReLU at the output layer. We then can prove by induction that E[∇H(l+1)] = H(l+1) and E[∇J(l)] =E[approx( ˜A⊤∇H(l+1) pre )] =∇J(l) for any layer l. A.3. Analysis of MEAN aggregator For GraphSAGE, one commonly used aggregator is the MEAN aggregator, which can be expressed as follows: H(l+1) = W1H(l) + W2SpMM MEAN(A, H(l)), (6) 13RSC: Accelerate Graph Neural Networks Training via Randomized Sparse Computations where SpMM MEAN is one variant of the vanilla SpMM , which replace the reducer function from sum(·) to mean(·). We note that in popular GNN packages, the MEAN aggregator usually is implemented based on SpMM MEAN (Fey & Lenssen, 2019; Wang et al., 2019) to reduce the memory usage. Here we give an example of SpMM MEAN to illustrate how it works: SpMM MEAN(   1 0 0 4 5 6  , \u00147 8 9 10 \u0015 ) = \"1 2 (1 × 7 + 0× 9) 1 2 (1 × 8 + 0× 10) 1 2 (0 × 7 + 4× 9) 1 2 (0 × 8 + 4× 10) 1 2 (5 × 7 + 6× 9) 1 2 (5 × 8 + 6× 10) # , Equivalently, the SpMM MEAN can also be expressed as: SpMM MEAN(A, H(l)) =D−1AH(l), where D is the degree matrix ofA. Thus, although we did not normalize the adjacency matrix in GraphSAGE, when applying the top-k sampling to approximate SpMM MEAN, the column norm of A:,ji is actually 1√ Degji due to the normalization. Also, for GraphSAGE, the inputs to the first SpMM MEAN operation are A and X. They do not require gradient since they are not trainable. Thus, the first SAGE layer is not presented in Figure 8 and Figure 7. B.

In Table 11, we show the run time of the greedy algorithm, which is negligible compared to the acceleration effect. C. Extended Related works Connections to Graph Data Augmentation Data augmentation (Liu et al., 2021; Han et al., 2022) is wildly adopted in the graph learning for improving model generalization, including dropping nodes (Feng et al., 2020), dropping edges (Rong et al., 2019), and graph mixup (Han et al., 2022). As shown in Figure 5, the top- k sampling drops the entire columns in the adjacency matrix, while keeping the number of rows unchanged. That means RSC drops all of the out edges for a set of nodes. This can be viewed as the “structural dropedge” for improving the efficiency. Since we only apply the top-k sampling in the backward pass and top- k indices are different for each operation, RSC essentially forward pass with the whole graph, backward pass with different subgraphs at each layer. This structural dropedge and heterogeneous backward propagation introduce the regularization effect. Thus as shown in the experiment section, RSC may also improve the model accuracy over the baseline. 14RSC: Accelerate Graph Neural Networks Training via Randomized Sparse Computations Subgraph-based GNN training. The key idea of this line of work is to improve the scalability of GNNs by separating the graph into overlapped small batches, then training models with sampled subgraphs (Hamilton et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2018; Zou et al., 2019; Chiang et al., 2019; Zeng et al., 2020). Based on this idea, various sampling techniques have been proposed, including the node-wise sampling (Hamilton et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017), layer-wise sampling (Huang et al., 2018; Zou et al., 2019), and subgraph sampling (Chiang et al., 2019; Zeng et al., 2020). However, this approach reduces the memory footprint but results in extra time cost to compute the overlapping nodes between batches. Generally, methods in this category are orthogonal to RSC , and they can be combined. Graph precomputation. The graph precomputation methods decouple the message passing from the model training, either as a preprocessing step (Wu et al., 2019; Klicpera et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2020) or post-processing step (Huang et al., 2020b), where the model is simplified as the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). We did consider this line of work in this paper since the backbone model is not GNN anymore. Distributed GNN training. The distributed training leverages extra hardwares to increase the memory capacity and training efficiency (Zha et al., 2023; 2022; Yuan et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Wang et al.). However, the graph data cannot be trivially divided into independent partitions due to the node connectivity. Thus, the graph distributed training frameworks propose to split graph into related partitions and minimize the communication overhead (Wan et al., 2021; 2022b; Ramezani et al., 2022). Our methods are orthogonal to this line of work. Other randomized GNN training. Dropedge (Rong et al., 2019) randomly drops edges to avoid the over-smoothing problem. Graph Random Neural Networks (Grand) (Feng et al., 2020) randomly drop nodes to generate data augmentation for improving model generalization. Grand+ improves the scalability over Grand by pre-computing a general propagation matrix and employ it to perform data augmentation (Feng et al., 2022). As shown in Section C, the key difference between GRAND(+) and RSC is that RSC does not drop any node. Instead RSC drops all of the out edges for a set of nodes only during backward pass. Moreover, the drop pattern are evolving during the training process. This can be viewed as the “structural dropedge”. However, unlike Dropedge (Rong et al., 2019), RSC drop the column-row pairs according to the euclidean norm instead of uniformly dropping. D. Experimental Settings D.1.

E.1. Additional Ablation Results to the Resource Allocation Algorithm (Figure 6) Due to the page limit, we present more ablation study on the resource allocation algorithm here. Specifically, in Figure 9, we compare RSC to the uniform allocation on ogbn-proteins dataset with GCN, GraphSAGE, and GCNII, respectively. In Figure 10, we compare RSC to the uniform allocation on Yelp dataset with GCN, GraphSAGE, and GCNII, respectively. We conclude that RSC generally outperforms the uniform allocation strategy. E.2. Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis Here we analyze the impacts of the main hyperparameters of RSC : (1) the budget C, which controls the efficiency-accuracy trade-off; (2) the step size α in the greedy Algorithm 1; (3) when switching back to the original sparse operations. In Figure 12, we vary only one of them with the others fixed. We conclude (1) larger budget C leads to better accuracy with smaller speedup, since we are using more computational resources to approximate the full operation. (2) larger step size α leads 17RSC: Accelerate Graph Neural Networks Training via Randomized Sparse Computations 1.01.21.41.61.8 Speedup 67 68 69 70 71 72Accuracy (%) GCN (ogbn-proteins) Uniform Allocation RSC 1.21.41.61.82.02.2 Speedup 70 71 72 73 74 75 76Accuracy (%) GraphSAGE (ogbn-proteins) Uniform Allocation RSC 1.01.21.41.61.8 Speedup 64 66 68 70 72 74Accuracy (%) GCNII (ogbn-proteins) Uniform Allocation RSC Figure 9: The Pareto frontier of the accuracy-efficiency trade-off for RSC and the uniform allocation.

Also the step size α does not affect the model accuracy a lot. In practice, we set α = 0.02|V|. (3) The later we switch back to the original operation, the larger the accuracy drop and the smaller the speedup, it is equivalent to using less resources to approximate the full operation epoch-wisely.

It only approximates sparse operations (SpMM) in the backward pass, as approximating in the forward pass introduces bias due to non-linear activation functions. For resource allocation, it frames the problem as a constrained optimization problem to minimize approximation error by customizing FLOPs for each layer using top-k sampling, solved efficiently with a greedy algorithm. To reduce sampling overhead, a caching mechanism reuses previously sampled sparse matrices across nearby iterations, leveraging the observation that top-k indices remain similar. A switching mechanism is employed to use approximated sparse operations during most of training and revert to original sparse operations at the final stage to improve convergence and minimize accuracy drop.",

In this paper, we present a method for accelerating and structuring self-attentions: Sparse Adaptive Connection (SAC). In SAC, we regard the input sequence as a graph and attention operations are performed between linked nodes. In contrast with previous self-attention models with pre-deﬁned structures (edges), the model learns to construct attention edges to improve task-speciﬁc performances. In this way, the model is able to select the most salient nodes and reduce the quadratic complexity regardless of the sequence length. Based on SAC, we show that previous variants of self-attention models are its special cases. Through extensive experiments on neural machine translation, language modeling, graph representation learning and image classiﬁcation, we demonstrate SAC is competitive with state-of-the-art models while signiﬁcantly reducing memory cost. 1 Introduction The self-attention mechanism has proved to beneﬁt a wide range of ﬁelds and tasks, such as natural language processing (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dai et al., 2019), computer vision (Xu et al., 2015; Jaderberg et al., 2015; Bello et al., 2019; Parmar et al., 2019), video classiﬁcation (Wang et al., 2018) and graph modeling (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019). The attention mechanism allows the model to attend to different parts of the input and capture the most salient features, and provides with the ability to handle dependencies between elements across long distances. Two conspicuous problems stand out with the self-attention mechanism: (1) the memory complexity is quadratic with respect to the input length, making it infeasible to handle long sequences; and (2) the self-attention operations are performed in a pre-deﬁned structure (usually fully-connected), which not only is costly but also lacks for the ability to learn the optimal attention structure optimized for the performance in the downstream tasks (Child et al., 2019; Sukhbaatar et al., 2019). These observations indicate that the fully-connected structure for self-attention operations can be replaced by a more sparse one where only speciﬁc edges are constructed for attention operations. In this paper, we present Sparse Adaptive Connection (SAC), which replaces the fully-connected structure in self-attention with a sparse graph-like structure adapted to different tasks. In SAC, we regard the input as a graph where a node could be a token in the sequence or an ﬂattened feature map of an image, and an edge between a pair of nodes represents they can attend to each other. To select edges, we propose an Edge Predictor which utilizes an LSTM model to dynamically predict pairs of nodes that represent two ends of an edge. In contrast with previous self-attention models with pre-deﬁned attention structures (edges), SAC learns to construct attention edges adaptively, which are optimized to improve task-speciﬁc performances using reinforcement learning models. We 34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020), Vancouver, Canada. arXiv:2003.09833v3  [cs.CL]  29 Sep 2020evaluate the proposed model on four tasks: neural machine translation, language modeling, graph representation learning and image classiﬁcation, and demonstrate that SAC learns to select the most salient nodes to attend to each other and is free from heavy memory cost while achieving strong performances. 2 Related Work Many recent researches have focused on modifying the structure of self-attention to relieve the computation and memory burden. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) enables learning long-term dependency by introducing a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel relative position encoding scheme (Shaw et al., 2018). (Guo et al., 2019) proposed Star Transformer, a variant of Transformer which replaces the fully-connected structure in self-attention with a star-shaped topology, where all tokens are connected with a relay node. (Child et al., 2019; Kitaev et al., 2020) suggest sparsifying Transformer by focusing only on a fraction of attention connections. (Child et al., 2019) introduced sparse factorizations of the attention matrix, which scale as O(np√n) with the sequence length, and a set of sparse attention kernels which efﬁciently compute subsets of the attention matrix. (Kitaev et al., 2020) proposed Reformer, a more efﬁcient yet complicated method for computing self-attention, where the dot-product attention is replaced by one that uses a locality-sensitive hashing, reducing the complexity from O(n2) to O(nlog n). (Ye et al., 2019) partitioned the sequence to different multi-scale spans and attended the context information from ﬁne-grain to coarse-grain as the relative distance increases. All above works rely on manually designed structures. Our work is inspired by (Sukhbaatar et al., 2019), which takes a step forward and uses a novel adaptive self- attention mechanism that can learn its optimal attention span for each head, and (Correia et al., 2019) which proposed adaptively sparse Transformer. Different from Yang et al. (2018), we use an LSTM to predict attention links which gives us ﬁner control of how sparse we want self-attention to be. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are known at learning local contextual information by encoding attribute features (Kipf and Welling, 2016; Hamilton et al., 2017b), but they are not able to explic- itly distinguish the most salient nodes from all its neighbors, neither can they directly attend to the nodes that are beyond one-hop away. Much work has investigated the effect of attention on GNNs (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2018; Abu-El-Haija et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018; Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2019). (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2018) extended self-attention to graphs by enabling each node to attend over its neighbors, achieving state-of-the-art results for semi-supervised node classiﬁcation tasks. But they simply applied self-attention over graphs to all neighbors of a node, which might be a problem when dealing with large and noisy graphs where only few neighbors need to be aggregated. (Ye and Ji, 2019) proposed Sparse Graph Attention Network which uses a binary gate to control whether each edge should be engaged. However, these works lack ability to aggregate long-range dependencies in graphs, and they only consider neighbors that are one hop away. Various methods have been proposed to tackle this issue (Ye et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Pei et al., 2020). Similar to graphs, (Bello et al., 2019) introduced a novel two-dimensional relative self-attention mechanism for images and augmented convolutional operators with this self-attention method, showing systematic improvements on both image classiﬁcation and object detection tasks across a wide range of architectures. 3 Background: Self-Attention Given a set of nodes1 {e1,··· ,eN}as inputs, self-attention iteratively computes the representation of ei in the l-th layer by attending to all its neighbors N(ei), which is deﬁned as follows: ˜hl i = ∑ ej∈N(ei) αijvl−1 j , αij = softmax   ( ql−1 i )T kl−1 j√ d   and ql−1 i = WQhl−1 i , kl−1 j = WKhl−1 j , vl−1 j = WVhl−1 j (1) where dis the hidden dimension, WQ,WK,WV are learnable parameters and q,k,v correspond to queries, keys and values, respectively. The multi-head mechanism linearly projects the queries, keys 1We use the term “node’ in a broad sense of denoting any particular unit in text, images or graphs. 2and values multiple times with different learned linear projections, and then performs self-attention in parallel, after which the results are concatenated and again projected: hl i = Concat(˜hl,1 i ,··· ,˜hl,m i )WO (2) where the superscript 1,···,m denotes the head number, and WO is learnable parameters. After L iterations, we obtain the ﬁnal representation for each node hL i . 4 Sparse Adaptive Connection for Self-Attention The key point in SAC is to use to an LSTM edge predictor to predict edges for self-attention operations between nodes, where a node could be a token in the sequence or an ﬂattened feature map of an image. Self-attention operations are performed between linked nodes instead of in a fully-connected manner. The LSTM edge predictor is optimized to improve task-speciﬁc performances using reinforcement learning models. 4.1 LSTM Edge Predictor In SAC, an edge predictor is used to construct edges between nodes for self-attention operations. Suppose that we are given a set of nodes {e1,··· ,eN}with no edge between any pair of nodes when initialization, our aim is to generate edges using this edge predictor, with the total number αN for each layer, where αis a hyperparameter deciding how many edges should be constructed for each node on average. The Edge Predictor uses an LSTM model as a backbone and sequentially predicts edges. The prediction of an edge is decoupled into the prediction of the original node and the destination node pair. More formally, the input to Edge Predictor is a special token “[SOS]”, and the model proceeds to predict the original node and destination node of all edges (2αN nodes in total) for the ﬁrst layer, denoted by {y1 1,y1 2,··· ,y1 2αN}, where the superscript denoted the index of the layer and the subscript denoted the index of the predicted node. At each time step, the input to the LSTM model is the representation hyt for the node that has just been predicted. Then it is combined with the previously constructed representation gt to obtain gt+1 representing the current time-step using LSTMs, and gt+1 is used to predict the following node using the softmax function. The projection matrix before softmax W shares embeddings with node representations, where each column wi is the vector representation for node ei. The probability of predicting node yt+1 given gt+1 is thus given by: p(yt+1 = ei) = exp (gT t+1 ·wi)∑ jexp (gT t+1 ·wj) (3) This process is repeated 2αN times. After the end of αN edge predictions, we update the representa- tion for each node based on self-attention as will be detailed in Section 4.1 for different tasks, and proceed to the next layer. For node predictions in the following layer, the initial input now becomes hidden state for the last time-step of the previous layer. The entire process is repeated Ltimes, where Ldenotes the number of self-attention layers and the resulted nodes in layerlare {yl 1,yl 2,··· ,yl 2αN}. Compared to separately predicting edges for each node, this approach is more ﬂexible and gives us ﬁner control of the total number of edges we would like to construct. More importantly, this process is aware of previous constructed edges, both in the current layer and previous layers. The recurrent edge predictor is shown in Figure 1(b). We implement it using a single-layer LSTM model. Once having constructed all edges for each layer, we can immediately obtain the set of neighbors N(en i) for each node ei in the n-th layer. Self-attention operations with multi-head mechanism are then performed on its neighbors for each node. For text tasks, we regard each token as a node. For graph-like structures, we treat nodes in the original graph as nodes. For images, the input (H,W,F in) dimensional sensor is reshaped to a HW ×Fin matrix, where each row can be thought as a node by our deﬁnition. 4.2 Distance Encoding The input graph intrinsically displays some degree of structures. For example, in a sequence of natural language tokens, the relative distance between two tokens in the sequence or the corresponding parse 3𝑒𝑖 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 i really like cats Edge  Predictor 𝑒𝑖 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 Self- Attention Self- Attention (a) (b) e1 e3 e3 e2 e2 e4 Distance Encodings 𝐠6 ×( )+ Node Encodings 𝐰1,𝐰2,𝐰3,𝐰4 𝐯2,𝐯0,𝐯1,𝐯-1 layer 𝑛 Figure 1: An illustration of the proposed Sparse Apdative Connection. (a) shows the process of SAC to construct edges and then perform self-attention on these edges (Red is for text and green is for graphs). (b) shows the edge prediction process of (a) with distance encodings. When predicting time-step 6, the word embeddings are added with distance encodings. tree encodes structural information. As another example, in the task of node representation learning in graphs (Yang et al., 2016b; Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018), the graph originally comes with the node edges. The LSTM edge predictor described above ignores this structure. To leverage original structural information, we propose distance encodings to incorporate graph structure into the edge predictor. Distance encodings only affect the destination node predictions. In contrast to only using node embedding matrix W, we add an extra distance matrix V that encodes distance information to the original projection matrix W, giving V + W. Each column in V is its corresponding distance representation to the current original node. For example in Figure 1, at time-step 6, when two edges (e1,e3),(e3,e2), and one origin node e2 have been generated, we are to use g5 ∈Rd, the output of the LSTM model at time-step 5, to predict the node at time-step 6. According to the original structure, the distance between e2 (the current origin node) and all the nodes e1,e2,e3,e4 by far are 2, 0, 1, and -1 respectively, where -1 means inability to reach. The distance vectors are thus v2,v0,v1,v−1, which are vectors of size Rd to be learned. Intuitively, this process also discourages generating duplicate edges and leverages the original structural information. In contrast to Veliˇckovi´c et al. (2017) where attention operations are only performed between nodes with literal edges in the original graph, SAC offers the ﬂexibility in leveraging the original graph structure and inﬂuence from the training signals. Additionally, SAC allows for more convenient information exchange between similar nodes that are far away in terms of distance in the original graph structure, which is because the connection construction stage has the ability to connect any pair nodes in the graph. This ability potentially leads to better performances. 4.3 Training and Test Directly training the edge predictor is impractical since we have no access to the ground-truth edges. We use REINFORCE, which is an instance of a broader class of policy gradient methods for optimization. The main idea is to use reinforcement learning to discover the best edge connections for self-attention operations. Each action ais the node predicted by edge predictor. Let Θ denote parameters of the edge predictor and Φ denote the parameters of the main network which maps an input to its ﬁnal label based on a pre-deﬁned self-attention structure. Under the framework of reinforcement learning, we ask the edge predictor to maximize its reward R(Θ), which is the log probability of predicting the correct label, e.g., for neural machine translation the reward Ris the average log probability of golden target tokens; for image classiﬁcation, the reward the log probability of the correct label. Consider the simple case where different attention layers use the same node connections, by sampling a sequence of nodes from the edge predictor, we are able to update the parameters in edge predictor using policy gradients: ∇J(Θ) = 2αN∑ i=1 ∇log p(ai|a1:i−1; Θ)(R(Θ) −b) (4) 4layer 𝑛 layer 𝑛 −1 Vanilla Self-attention Transformer-XL Seg-Length=2 BT-Transformer layer 𝑛 +1 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 Adaptive Span S=2 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 Figure 2: Connection of SAC to other methods for computing self-attention. where bdenotes the baseline which is the average of the previous rewards. Φ is updated directly based on the log-likelihood. At test time, edges are decoded using beam search. We use a beam size of 5 for all models. 4.4 Variants of Edge Predictor The vanilla version of the Edge Predictor can be further regulated, simpliﬁed or expanded with prior knowledge for preferable graph structures. All layers sharing the same structure To reduce the computational cost and RL search space, we can enforce the edge structure to be the same for all layers, where the process is only executed once instead of Ltimes. We adopt this strategy for all settings to reduce the search space. All nodes connected in each layer To enforce each node to be connected in each layer, for each node ei, it is repeatedly fed to the predictor αtimes as the original node, and we only predict the destination node. The graph can be either directed graph or undirected graph, depending on how we want self-attention to be computed. Different heads attending to different contexts (head adaptive for short) Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) shows that it is beneﬁcial if different heads attend to different spans (some focusing on the recent history, while others focusing the whole available context). We can also augment the model by assigning each head with a edge predictor, providing the ﬂexibility that different heads can attend to different chunks of context. We sequentially predict all input and output nodes for each head, and the prediction of 2αN nodes are repeated Htimes. In this way, the prediction model for the current head is aware of the information of all previous heads. A head speciﬁc embedding is appended to the node embedding in LSTMs to let the model be aware of the current head. Since this strategy signiﬁcantly increases the search space in RL, we empirically ﬁnd that it helps some settings, but not always. 4.5 Connection to Existing Methods In this subsection, we describe the connection between SAC and previous variants of self-attentions, and show that these variants computing self-attention can be obtained through SAC if we slightly modify the edge predictor. For ease of exposition, we use EP(e) ={(ei,ej)}to denote the collection of all edges for self-attention operations. Connection to vanilla self-attention (Vaswani et al., 2017) The vanilla self-attention links each pair of nodes, where EP(e) can be described as EP(e) ={(ei,ej)|i∈[1,N]}. Connection to Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) Transformer-XL treats the text in a segment- by-segment style. Self-attention operations are performed between nodes within the same segment. EP(e) can be described as EP(e) ={(ei,ej)|i∈[1,N]; j ∈Segment(i)}. Connection to Adaptive Span Transformer (Sukhbaatar et al., 2019) Adaptive Span Trans- former learns an optimal attention span for each head. Suppose the span size assigned to head tis s, then EP(e,t) can be described by: EP(e)={(ei,ej)|i∈[1,N]; j = i,i −1,··· ,i −s+ 1;span = t}. Connection to BP-Transformer (Ye et al., 2019) BP-Transformer constructed a tree-like graph by adding span nodes apart from token nodes. There are 2N −1 nodes in total, where N is the sequence length. In BP-Transformer, each token (leaf) node attends to each span (non-leaf) node that includes it, which we refer to as Ancestor(ei) for node ei. It is easy to prove that a leaf node is 5Model H B edges dev test test (heads) (blocks) (BLEU) (BLEU) (cased sacreBLEU) Transformer Base (Vaswani et al., 2017) 8 6 N2 25.8 27.3 BP base (Ye et al., 2019) 28.1 27.6 Reversible base (Kitaev et al., 2020) 28.0 27.4 SAC base 8 6 2 N 17.4 18.3 17.8 SAC base 8 6 5 N 25.6 27.0 26.2 SAC base 8 6 10 N 26.0 27.7 27.0 SAC base 8 6 15 N 25.6 27.4 26.8 SAC base 16 6 10 N 26.2 28.1 27.6 SAC base 16 12 10 N 26.4 28.4 27.8 Transformer big (Vaswani et al., 2017) 16 6 N2 26.4 28.4 Reversible big (Kitaev et al., 2020) 29.1 28.4 SAC Large 16 6 10 N 26.7 28.9 28.1 SAC Large 16 18 10 N 26.9 29.4 28.6 SAC Large (dependency) 16 18 10 N 26.9 29.5 28.8 Table 1: BLEU scores on the newstest2013 for development and newstest2014 for test for WMT English-German. N denotes the length of the input sequence. associated with ⌊log2 N⌋non-leaf nodes (and thus attends to ⌊log2 N⌋nodes). Therefore, we have EP(e)={(ei,ej)|i∈[1,N]; j ∈Ancestor(ei)}. 5 Experiments 5.1 Machine Translation We use the encoder-decoder model (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Vaswani et al., 2017) as the backbone for machine translation. For the encoder, SAC constructs αN edges for each layer and self-attention operations are performed between connected nodes. For the decoder, masked attention (Vaswani et al., 2017) is applied. Speciﬁcally, given a newly generated target node, it can attend to all source nodes, dummy nodes, target nodes that come beforehand, but not target nodes that come afterwards. We again use SAC to construct edges between the newly generated node and the preceding nodes, where the input node to the edge predictor is forced to be the newly generated node, and the output node is limited to preceding nodes and the dummy nodes. Following Vaswani et al. (2017); Ott et al. (2018); Kitaev et al. (2020), we used the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset to test the proposed model. The dataset consists of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences are encoded using BPE (Sennrich et al., 2016), which has a shared source target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For fair comparison, we used the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ= 10−9 for all models. Label smoothing (Szegedy et al., 2016) with ϵ= 0.1 is applied for all models. For the base setup, following Vaswani et al. (2017), the dimensionality of inputs and outputs dmodel is set to 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality dff is set to 2,048. For big models, dmodel is set to 1,024 and dff is set to 4,096. Models are run on 8 NVIDIA V100 GPUs. Results are shown in Table 1. As we gradually increase the number of edges for each layer (from 2 to 5 to 10 to 15 per node), we can see that the performance ﬁrst increases, reaching the highest with αset to 10, and then decreases. This means that performing attention operations between all pairs is not only unnecessary, but can hurt the performance. Memory saved from sparse connections allow for more heads to perform attentions and deeper networks with more blocks, leading to better performances over vanilla transformers. We also implement a dependency-based model, in which English sources were ﬁrst parsed using Stanford Dependency parser (Chen and Manning, 2014). Relative positions between nodes in the dependency trees are encoded in distance encodings of the edge predictor. The introduction of dependency parser for attention construction introduces +0.14 BLEU score boost. We did not observe signiﬁcant performance boost from the head-adaptive strategy, and thus omit their performances. 6Method Enwiki8 Text8 Params Trans (Al-Rfou et al., 2019) 1.11 1.18 44M Trans-XL (Dai et al., 2019) 1.06 - 41M Adaptive(Sukhbaatar et al., 2019) 1.02 1.11 39M BPT (Ye et al., 2019) 1.02 1.11 38M SAC (basic) 1.02 1.07 39M SAC (head adaptive) 1.00 1.06 39M Table 2: Performances on language modeling datasets. 5.2 Language Modeling We use character-level language modeling datasets to evaluate SAC’s ability to handle long-term dependencies. We use Enwiki8 (Mahoney, 2011) and Text8 (Mahoney, 2011) for evaluation and report the values of BPC for different models. We use the Transformer decoder architecture as the backbone. We compare SAC with other variations of transformers to ﬁt long sequences into the model, including the vanilla Transformer (Al-Rfou et al., 2019), which splits the whole sequence into smaller segments, and only trains the model within each segment and ignore the rest; Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) that adopts a recurrence mechanism to cache the memory of previous segments; adaptive span model (Sukhbaatar et al., 2019) that assigns different heads with different text spans in an adaptive fashion; and the BP-Transformer (Ye et al., 2019) that splits the sequence using binary trees. For SAC, αis set to 256 for each node. The relatively small memory cost allows the model to look at a maximum context of 50k characters. Input dimensionality is set to 512, and the inner-layer dimensionality 2,048. Following (Sukhbaatar et al., 2019), we use Adagrad for optimization, with a batch size of 64 and ﬁxed learning rate of 0.07 and 32k warm-up steps. Results are shown in Table2. As can be seen, SAC-basic outperforms the other Transformers by 0.04 bcp on Text8 while signiﬁcantly reducing the memory usage for large attention spans. For Enwiki8, it ties with the best BPT model, achieving 1.02 bcp score. The improvement validates the importance modeling long-term dependencies with limited available memory. We also ﬁnd that, in the language modeling tasks, the head-adaptive strategy helps, 5.3 Representation Learning in Graphs We test the performance of the proposed model on both transductive and inductive benchmark datasets. For the transductive setup, we used the three standard citation network benchmarks, Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed (Sen et al., 2008). In the transductive setup, we used the Protein-protein interaction dataset (PPI) (Zitnik and Leskovec, 2017). The training algorithm has access to all of the nodes’ feature vectors and labels, and predictions are performed on the test nodes. The detailed descriptions for Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed and PPI are found in the Appendix due to the space limit. The difference between SAC and (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2017) is that the latter performs self-attention operations between nodes that are connected though graph edges, while SAC perform self-attention operations between nodes linked by the edge predictor. For fast convergence, we initialize SAC using the pretrained attention model (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2017), where attention links are just edges in the original graph. Then we start exploring edge construction across all nodes. the number of attention heads is ﬁxed to 8 and the number of blocks is set to 12. We experiment different values of α, i.e, [5, 10, 50, 100] unless the memory usage reaches limitation. We train all models with Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) and early stopping on the validation set. The initial learning rate is treated as a hyper-parameter trained on the validation set. Following (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2017), we run 100 epochs in total and use an early stopping strategy on the both the cross-entropy loss and accuracy for transductive tasks and micro-F1 for inductive tasks. Each experiment is repeated three times and we report the mean value. Results are shown in Table 3. We note that SAC achieves signiﬁcant performance boosts over existing methods across all four datasets, i.e., outperforms our implemented GAT +1.8, +1.1, +0.7 and +1.1 respectively on Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed and PPI. The explanation for SAC’s advantage is as follows: graph node representation learning concerns about both label propagation and relatedness between nearby nodes in the vector space, the latter of which is what GCN handles.

The attention edge prediction stage in SAC fosters information exchange between nodes that are not directly linked in graph but similar in terms of label propagation. SAC actually offers the probability in bridging the aspects, leading to better performances. 5.4 Image Classiﬁcation Augmenting convolution models with self-attention (Bello et al., 2019; Parmar et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019) provides the model with the ability to capture global contexts in an image and has yielded gains in several vision tasks such as image classiﬁcation and objective detection. We follow the protocols in (Bello et al., 2019), i.e. incorporating relative position embeddings for self-attention operations and augmenting each ResNet (Zagoruyko and Komodakis, 2016; He et al., 2016) block with self-attentions. To handle the prohibitive memory cost, (Bello et al., 2019) performs self-attention operations starting from the last layer, which has the smallest spatial dimension, until memory constraints are hit. This ad-hoc strategy is replaced by SAC. Following (Bello et al., 2019), we conduct experiments on CIFAR-100 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009) and ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009). For CIFAR-100, we use the Wide-ResNet-28-10, the architecture of which comprises 3 stages of 4 residual blocks each using two 3×3 convolutions. We augment each convolution of all residual blocks with the number of attention heads set to 16. For ImageNet, we use ResNet-50, the block of which consists of 1×1, 3×3, 1×1 convolutions where the last pointwise convolution expands the number of ﬁlters and the ﬁrst one contracts the number of ﬁlters. We tune αin range {5,10,20}. Results are shown in Table 4. As can be seen, the proposed SAC model signiﬁcantly outperforms the attention model in (Bello et al., 2019) with the only modiﬁcation of automatic edge construction. Speciﬁcally, the top-1 score increases from 81.6 to 82.4 for CIFAR-100 and from 77.7 to 78.7 for ImageNet. The improvement validates the importance of performing necessary attention operations under memory limit. 86 Conclusion In this work, we propose Sparse Adaptive Connection — a sparse connection method to accelerate and structure the self-attention mechanism that adapts to various downstream tasks. We use an LSTM edge predictor to construct edges for self-attention operations, which gives us control of how sparse we want self-attention to be by setting the sparse coefﬁcient α. We demonstrate that SAC is competitive with state-of-the-art models on neural machine translation, language modeling, graph classiﬁcation and image classiﬁcation, while reducing memory costs. Broader Impact Accelerating fully-connected self-attention has been a research trend in recent years. Vanilla self- attention models, such as Transformers and BERT, are not able to process extremely long text, where text must be in advance segmented into pieces and then can be individually modelled. The lack of adequate context leads to poor performances in generating long, coherent and ﬂuent text. The goal of our proposed method, SAC, is to provide a way of relieving the computation burden of vanilla self-attention by automatically searching for the best attention patterns. We believe SAC has great potentials to generate high-quality long text. While there is risk of abuse, like generating fake news, the value of SAC is generally safe and weighs more than abuse to the whole society.

Bioinformatics, 33(14):i190–i198. 12A Graph Datasets For the transductive setup, we used the three standard citation network benchmarks, Cora, Cite- seer and Pubmed (Sen et al., 2008). We followed the transductive setup adopted in (Yang et al., 2016b; Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018), where nodes correspond to documents and edges to (undirected) citations. Cora contains 2708 nodes, 5429 edges, 7 classes and 1433 features per node. Citeseer contains 3327 nodes, 4732 edges, 6 classes and 3703 features per node. Pubmed contains 19717 nodes, 44338 edges, 3 classes and 500 features per node. For the inductive setup, we used the Protein-protein interaction dataset (PPI) (Zitnik and Leskovec, 2017), which aims at classifying protein roles such as cellular functions and gene ontology in various protein-protein interaction (PPI) graphs, where each graph corresponds to a different human tissue. Critically, testing graphs remain completely unobserved during training. The dataset has 56.9K nodes, 806.2 edges with 121 classes. The average number of nodes per graph is 2372. Each node has 50 features that are composed of positional gene sets, motif gene sets and immunological signatures. There are 121 labels for each node set from gene ontology, collected from the Molecular Signatures Database (Liberzon et al., 2011), and a node can have several labels simultaneously. 13barack obama is an american politician and attorney who served as the 44th president of the united states from 2009 to 2017 . a member of the democratic party , he was the first african-american president of the united states . he previously served as a u.s. senator from illinois from 2005 to 2008 and an illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004 . barack obama is an american politician and attorney who served as the 44th president of the united states from 2009 to 2017 . a member of the democratic party , he was the first african-american president of the united states . he previously served as a u.s. senator from illinois from 2005 to 2008 and an illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004 . 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Figure 3: Predicted self-attention links for the text barack obama is an american politician and attorney who served as the 44th president of the president of the united states from 2009 to 2017. as a member of the democratic party, he was the ﬁrst african-american president of the united states. he previously served as a u.s. senator from illinois from 2005 to 2008 and an illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004. 14",

        "main_contributions": "The paper introduces Sparse Adaptive Connection (SAC), a method to accelerate and structure the self-attention mechanism by addressing its quadratic memory complexity and reliance on pre-defined, fully-connected attention structures. SAC regards the input sequence as a graph and learns to construct task-specific attention edges using a reinforcement learning-optimized LSTM edge predictor. This approach allows the model to select the most salient nodes to attend to, effectively reducing quadratic complexity and memory cost. The key contributions include: (1) A novel adaptive self-attention mechanism that learns optimal sparse connections. (2) Demonstrating that many existing self-attention variants can be viewed as special cases of SAC. (3) Achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art models across diverse tasks (neural machine translation, language modeling, graph representation learning, and image classification) while significantly reducing memory consumption.",
        "methodology": "Sparse Adaptive Connection (SAC) operates by treating the input sequence as a graph where nodes can be tokens, feature maps, or graph nodes. Instead of fully-connected attention, SAC performs operations between learned linked nodes. An **LSTM Edge Predictor** dynamically predicts pairs of nodes to form edges for self-attention. For each layer, it predicts 2αN nodes, where α is a hyperparameter for average edges per node. The prediction process is sequential, using the current LSTM hidden state to predict the next node via a softmax function. **Distance Encodings** are incorporated to leverage original structural information (e.g., relative distances in sequences or graph edges) by adding a learnable distance matrix to the projection matrix during destination node prediction. **Reinforcement Learning (REINFORCE)** is used to train the edge predictor by maximizing a reward function (e.g., log probability of correct labels), as ground-truth edges are unavailable. **Beam search** (beam size 5) is used for decoding edges at test time. Variants include enforcing all layers to share the same edge structure, ensuring all nodes are connected in each layer, and a head-adaptive strategy where different attention heads have separate edge predictors.",
        "experimental_setup": "SAC was evaluated across four diverse tasks: Neural Machine Translation (NMT), Character-level Language Modeling, Graph Representation Learning, and Image Classification. For **NMT**, the WMT 2014 English-German dataset (4.5M sentence pairs, 37k BPE tokens) was used with an encoder-decoder Transformer backbone. Models were optimized with Adam, label smoothing, and run on 8 NVIDIA V100 GPUs, evaluating BLEU scores on newstest2013 and newstest2014. The sparsity coefficient α was varied (2, 5, 10, 15 edges per node). For **Language Modeling**, Enwiki8 and Text8 datasets were used with a Transformer decoder, optimized by Adagrad, and evaluated using Bits Per Character (BPC). α was set to 256 for each node, enabling a 50k character context. For **Graph Representation Learning**, transductive tasks used Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed citation networks, while inductive tasks used the Protein-protein interaction (PPI) dataset. SAC was initialized with a pre-trained Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, with 8 attention heads and 12 blocks, and α varied (5, 10, 50, 100). Adam optimizer and early stopping were employed, reporting classification accuracy (transductive) and micro-F1 (inductive). For **Image Classification**, CIFAR-100 (Wide-ResNet-28-10 backbone) and ImageNet (ResNet-50 backbone) were used, augmenting each convolution with self-attention (16 heads for CIFAR-100). α was tuned in {5, 10, 20}, and top-1/top-5 accuracy, GFlops, and parameters were reported.",
        "limitations": "The 'head adaptive' strategy, while conceptually appealing, did not consistently yield significant performance improvements across all experimental settings and substantially increased the reinforcement learning search space, indicating its current implementation might not be universally effective or efficient. The direct training of the edge predictor is impractical without ground-truth edges, necessitating the use of reinforcement learning (REINFORCE), which can introduce complexity in training and potential challenges in exploration and convergence. The reliance on the hyperparameter 'α' to control sparsity means that finding the optimal balance between sparsity and performance requires manual tuning, rather than being adaptively learned by the model.",
        "future_research_directions": "The authors suggest that SAC has great potential for generating high-quality long text, implying its application to tasks requiring extended context without segmentation limitations inherent in vanilla Transformers. Future work could explore more advanced or efficient reinforcement learning strategies for optimizing the edge predictor, potentially reducing training complexity and improving convergence. Investigating adaptive mechanisms for determining the optimal sparsity coefficient (α) rather than treating it as a fixed hyperparameter could further enhance SAC's performance and generality. Additionally, exploring the head-adaptive strategy with refined architectures or training approaches could yield better results across a broader range of tasks."

A number of GNNs have been widely used in real-world applications, such as recommendation sy stem (Jin et al., 2020), and social net- work analysis (Lerer et al., 2019), etc. Many of these tasks p ut forward high requirements for low- latency inference. However, the real-world graphs are ofte n extremely large and irregular, such as Reddit with 232,965 nodes, which needs 19G ﬂoating-point op erations (FLOPs) to be processed by a 2-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with only 81KB pa rameters (T ailor et al., 2020), while ResNet-50, a 50-layer DNN, only takes 8G FLOPs to process an i mage (Canziani et al., 2016).

Unfortunately, there remain some issues in the e xisting works on GNNs quantization. Feng et al. (2020) only quantizes the node feature and keeps ﬂ oating point calculations during infer- ence. T ailor et al. (2020) proposes a degree-quant training strategy to quantize GNNs to the low-bit ﬁxed point but causes a large accuracy drop, e.g., 11.1% accu racy drops when quantizing to 4bits. Moreover, some works (W ang et al., 2021b; Bahri et al., 2021; W ang et al., 2021a; Jing et al., 2021) quantize GNNs into 1-bit and compute with XNOR and bit count o perations. However, these 1-bit quantization methods are either restricted to the node-lev el tasks or can not generalize well to other GNNs. Most of the above methods do not make full use of the property o f GNNs and graph data, re- sulting in severe accuracy degradation or poor generalizat ion. As presented in MPNN framework (Gilmer et al., 2017), GNNs processing is divided into two ph ase: First, in the aggregation phase, a node collects information from neighboring nodes and uses the aggregation function to generate hidden features; second, in the update phase, the hidden fea tures are transformed into new features by an update function. W e analyze the nodes features after ag gregation in Figure 1 and ﬁnd that the higher the in-degree is, the larger the node features ten d to be after aggregation. And the fea- tures vary signiﬁcantly between nodes with different in-de grees, which represent the topology of a graph. Moreover, according to Xie et al. (2014); Aiello et al . (2001), the degrees of nodes in most real-world graph data often follow the power-law distribut ion, i.e., nodes with a low degree account for the majority of graph data. Therefore, specially quanti zing the nodes features according to the topology of the graphs will be beneﬁcial to reduce the quanti zation error while achieving a higher compression ratio. In this paper, we propose theAggregation-A ware Quantization(A2Q) method, which quantizes different nodes features with different learnable quantiz ation parameters, including bitwidth and step size. These parameters can be adaptively learned durin g training and are constrained by a penalty on memory size to improve the compression ratio. How ever, when quantizing the model in semi-supervised tasks, the gradients for most quantizat ion parameters are zero due to the sparse connections between nodes, which makes the training non-tr ivial. W e propose the Local Gradient method to solve this problem by introducing quantization er ror as supervised information. Finally, to generalize our method to unseen graphs in which the number of the nodes varies, we develop the Nearest Neighbor Strategy which assigns the learned quantization parameters to the un seen graph nodes. T o the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to introdu ce the mixed-precision quantization to the GNNs. Compared with the previous works, our proposed m ethods can signiﬁcantly compress GNNs with negligible accuracy drop. In summary, the key contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) W e propose the Aggregation-A ware mixed-precision Quant ization ( A2Q) method to enable an adaptive learning of quantization parameters. Our learn ing method is powerful by fully 2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 utilizing the characteristic of GNNs, and the learned bitwi dth is strongly related to the topology of the graph. 2) A Local Gradient method is proposed to train the quantization parameters in s emi- supervised learning tasks. Furthermore, to generalize our method to the unseen graphs in which the number of input nodes is variable, we develop the Nearest Neighbor Strategy to select quantization parameters for the nodes of the unsee n graphs. 3) Experiments demonstrate that we can achieve a compressio n ratio up to 18.6x with negli- gible accuracy degradation compared to the full-precision (FP32) models. Moreover, the model trained with our A2Q method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOT A) method up to 11.4% with a speedup up to 2.00x in semi-supervised tasks, and obtains up to 9.5% gains with a 1.16x speedup in graph-level tasks.

(2008), which attempted to generalize neur al networks to model non-Euclidean data. In the following years, various GNN models were proposed. Fo r example, Graph Convolution Net- work (GCN) (Kipf & W elling, 2016) uses a layer-wise propagat ion rule that is based on a ﬁrst-order approximation of spectral convolutions on graphs, Graph Is omorphism Network (GIN) (Xu et al., 2018) designed a provably maximally powerful GNN under the M PNN framework, and Graph At- tention Network (GA T) (V eliˇ ckovi´ c et al., 2017) introduc es the attention mechanism to graph pro- cessing. Although GNNs have encouraging performance in a wi de range of domains (Jin et al., 2020; Y ang, 2019), the huge amount of ﬂoat-point operations and memory access in process pose a challenge to efﬁcient inference, which hinder the applicat ions of GNNs. Quantized GNNs: As a promising method to reduce the model size and accelerate the inference process, quantization is also applied to GNNs. Some works qu antize features and weights in GNNs to low bitwidths (Feng et al., 2020; T ailor et al., 2020) or ev en 1-bit (W ang et al., 2021b; Bahri et al., 2021; W ang et al., 2021a; Jing et al., 2021), i.e., use ﬁxed-p oint numbers instead of ﬂoating-point numbers for computation. But when the compression ratio is h igh (e.g., <4bit), the performance degradation of these works is signiﬁcant, and the generaliz ation of 1-bit method is limited. There are also some works on vector quantization (VQ), which use th e vectors in a codebook obtained during the training process instead of the original feature s (Ding et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022). However, searching for vectors in the codebook is computati onally complex. Mixed-Precision Quantization: Based on the idea that different layers have different sensi tiv- ities to quantization, mixed-precision quantization is pr oposed in CNNs to quantize different layers to different bitwidths for better model compression. Early works (W ang et al., 2019; Lou et al., 2019) proposed reinforcement learning (RL) based methods t o search bitwidth for different lay- ers, but they often require large computational resources, which limits the exploration of the search space. Another important class of mixed-precision method i s the criteria-based method, they use the speciﬁc criteria to represent the quantization sensitivit y, e.g., (Dong et al., 2019; 2020; Chen et al., 2021)quantize different layers with different bitwidths b ased on the trace of the Hessian. Recently, there are some other methods to learn the bitwidth during tra ining (Uhlich et al., 2019; Esser et al., 2019; Jain et al., 2020). However, due to the huge difference between GNNs and CNNs, it is dif- ﬁcult to use these methods on GNNs directly, and our A2Q is the ﬁrst method to introduce the mixed-precision quantization to GNNs, further improving t he inference efﬁciency of GNNs. 3 M ETHOD In this section, we describe our proposed Aggregation-A war e Quantization in detail. Firstly, we present the formulation of the mixed-precision quantizati on for GNNs, which fully utilizes the prop- erty of GNNs and graph data. Secondly, we introduce the Local Gradient method to address the gradient vanishing problem during training. Finally, we de tail the Nearest Neighbor Strategy, which is used for generalizing our approach to the unseen graphs. 3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023  !\"\"  !\"#  !\"$   !#\"  !##  !#$   !$\"  !$#  !$$   !%\"  !%#  !%$   !&\"  !&#  !&$  !'\"  !'#  !'$ (\" (# ($ (% (& (' ) *\"\" ) *\"# ) *#\" ) *## ) *$\" ) *$# +\" ´ = ,\"\" ,\"# ,#\" ,## ,$\" ,$# ,%\" ,%# ,&\" ,&# ,'\" ,'# (\"-\" (\"-# (#-\" (#-# ($-\" ($-# (%-\" (%-# (&-\" (&-# ('-\" ('-# Nodes Features Weights   !

W e use the learnable parameters step size α i ∈ R+ and bitwidth bi ∈ R+ to quantize the features of the i-th node as: ¯xi = sign(xi)      ⌊|xi| α i + 0. 5⌋, |x| < α i(2[bi]−1 − 1) 2[bi]−1 − 1, |xi| ≥ α i(2[bi]−1 − 1) , (1) where ⌊·⌋ is the ﬂoor function, and [·] is the round function to ensure the bitwidth used to quantize is an integer. The learnable parameters are sX = ( α 1, α 2, ..., α N ), and bX = ( b1, b 2, ..., b N ). Then we can obtain the ﬁxed-point feature map ¯X, and the original feature can be represented as Xq = SX · ¯X, where SX = diag(α 1, α 2, ..., α N ). Note that we use [b] + 1 as the quantization bitwidth for the features after ReLU because the values are a ll non-negative. In the update phase, the node features are often transformed with a linear mapping or an MLP in which matrix multiplication XW is the main computation, and the transformed node features a re the input to the next layer in GNNs. In order to accelerate the update phase, we also quantize W . Due to the fact that W in a certain layer is shared by all nodes, we quantize W to the same bitwidth of 4bits for all GNNs in this paper. However, each column of W has its learnable quantization step size, i.e., sW = ( β1, β 2, .., β F2 ), where F2 is the output-dimension of the node features in current layer and βi is the quantization step size for the i-th column of W , and we also use Eq. 1 to quantize W . W e can obtain the integer representation ¯W and the quantized representation Wq = ¯W · SW , where SW = diag(β1, β 2, ..., β F2 ). The ﬂoat-point matrix multiplication in the update phase c an be reformulated as follow: X · W ≈ Xq · Wq = ( SX · ¯X) · ( ¯W · SW ) = ( ¯X · ¯W ) ⊙ (sX ⊗ sW ) , (2) where ⊙ denotes an element-wise multiplication, and ⊗ denotes the outer product. After training, we can obtain sX and sW so that the outer product can be pre-processed before infere nce. An example is illustrated in Figure 2. For the aggregation phas e, i.e., AX, A is the adjacency matrix and A ∈ { 0, 1}N×N , we quantize the X as the quantization way of W because the nodes features involved in the aggregation process come from the update pha se, in which the features lose the topology information of graphs. Then the aggregation phase can be performed by integer operations to reduce the computational overhead. The quantization parameters(s, b ) are trained by the backpropagation algorithm. Since the ﬂoo r and round functions used in the quantization process are not differentiable, we use the straight- through estimator (Bengio et al., 2013) to approximate the g radient through these functions, and the gradients of the quantization parameters can be calculated by: ∂L ∂s = d∑ i=1 ∂L ∂xi q · ∂xi q ∂s , (3) ∂L ∂b = d∑ i=1 ∂L ∂xi q · ∂xi q ∂b , (4) where d is the dimension of the vector x, (s, b ) are the quantization parameters for x, and xi q is the value of i-th dimension in xq. Detailed information about quantization process and the backpropagation are shown in Appendix A.1 and A.3 Proof 2 and 3. 4Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 In order to improve the compression ratio of the node feature s, we introduce a penalty term on the memory size: Lmemory = ( 1 η · L∑ l=1 N∑ i=1 diml ·bl i− Mtarget )2 , (5) where L is the number of layers in the GNNs, N is the total number of nodes, diml is the length of the node features in l-th layer, bl iis the quantization bitwidth for node i in l-th layer, Mtarget is the target memory size on the total node features memory size, an d η = 8 ∗ 1024, which is a constant to convert the unit of memory size to KB. Then the model and quantization parameters can be trained by the loss function: Ltotal = Ltask + λ · Lmemory , (6) where Ltask is the task-related loss function and λ is a penalty factor on Lmemory . 3.2 L O CA L GRA D IE N T Although the above end-to-end learning method is concise an d straightforward, the gradients for the quantization parameters of nodes features, i.e., ∂L task ∂s and ∂L task ∂b , are almost zero during the training process of semi-supervised tasks, which poses a si gniﬁcant challenge to train the quantiza- tion parameters for nodes features. W e analyze the property of GNNs and graph data, and ﬁnd that two reasons lead to this phenomenon: 1. The extreme sparsity of the connections between nodes in graph data. 2. Only a tiny fraction of nodes with labels are used for training in semi-supervised tasks (e.g., 0. 30% in PubMed dataset). Therefore, ∂L task ∂x q for most node features are zero (detailed proof in Appendix A.3.2), which results in that the gradient s for quantization parameters of these nodes vanish according to Eq. 3 and Eq. 4. T o clarify, we visua lize the ∂L task ∂x q in the second layer of GCN trained on Cora. As shown in Figure 3, most gradients fo r the nodes features are zero. The gradients of the Ltask w .r.t. quantized nodes features can be viewed as the supervi sed infor- mation from the labeled nodes which enable the training of th e quantization parameters for nodes features. However, this supervised information is missing due to zero gradients. Considering the quantization error is related to the Ltask, we introduce the quantization error E = 1 d |xq − x|1 as the supervised information for the quantization parameter s of nodes features, where x is the features before quantization, xq is the features after quantization and | · | 1 denotes the L1 norm. W e refer to this method as Local Gradient because the gradients are computed by the local quantizatio n er- rors instead of back-propagated task-related gradients. T hen the quantization parameters for node features can be trained by gradients from E: ∂E ∂s = 1 d d∑ i=1 sign(xi q− xi) · ∂xi q ∂s , (7) ∂E ∂b = 1 d d∑ i=1 sign(xi q− xi) · ∂xi q ∂b . (8) Note that the quantization parameters of W are still trained by utilizing the gradients in Eq. 3. 3.3 N E A RE S T NE IG H BO R ST RAT E G Y In graph-level tasks, the quantized GNNs are required to gen eralize to unseen graphs. In such a scenario, the number of input nodes may vary during training or inference. However, the learnable method can only train a ﬁxed number of (s, b ) pairs which are the same as the number of input nodes, so it is challenging to learn the s and b for every node in graph-level tasks. T o solve this problem, we propose the Nearest Neighbor Strategy , which allows learning of a ﬁxed number of quantization parameters and select quantization paramete rs for the unseen graphs. The proposed strategy is shown in Algorithm 1. T o ensure the n umerical range of xq is as close as to x at FP32, a simple way is to keep the maximum quantization valu e equal to the maximum absolute value of x. Based on this idea, we ﬁrst initialize m groups of quantization parameters, then we calculate the maximum quantization value for every group , i.e., qmax = s(2[b]−1 − 1). When quantizing the features of node i, the feature with the largest absolute value fi in the node features xi is ﬁrst selected, and then we ﬁnd the nearest qmax and quantize the node features with the (s, b ) corresponding to this qmax. When performing backpropagation, we ﬁrst calculate the gr adients of the loss function w .r.t. quantization parameters accordin g to Eq. 3 and Eq. 4. For a speciﬁc set of quantization parameters (sj , b j), we collect the gradients from the nodes that have used them 5Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Algorithm 1 Nearest Neighbor Strategy 1: ForwardPass (X = ( x1, x2, ..., xN )T ): 2: Initialize(s, b), s ∈ Rm×1 + , b ∈ Rm×1 + before training 3: Calculate qmax = s ⊙ (2b−1 − 1) 4: Calculate the maximum absolute value in the features of each node: fi = max j abs(x(j) i ) 5: Search the index of quantization parameters for each node: indexi = arg min k |fi − qk max| 6: Quantize the i-th node features using (sindexi , b indexi ) 7: return Xq 8: end T able 1: The results comparison on node-level tasks.

Since today’s CPUs and G PUs can not support mixed-precision operations well, we implement a precision-scalable hardwa re accelerator to perform the overall in- ference process for GNN. The accelerator employs massive bi t-serial multipliers Judd et al. (2016), therefore, the latency of the integer multiplications is de termined by the bitwidth of the node fea- tures. T o evaluate the performance gains of our method over D Q-INT4, we develop a cycle-accurate simulator for our accelerator. More details about accelera tor architecture are shown in Appendix A.7.5. Moreover, we show the compression ratio of quantized GNNs compared to the FP32 models in terms of overall memory size. For simplicity, we use GNN(D Q) to represent the GNNs quantized by DQ-INT4 and GNN-dataset to represent the task in which we r un the experiment, e.g., GCN- Cora represents the GCN model trained on Cora. Detailed info rmation about datasets and settings is in Appendix A.5 and Appendix A.6. 4.2 N O D E -L E V E L TA S K S T able 1 shows the experimental results on three GNN architec tures trained on four node-level datasets. Compared with DQ-INT4, our method can achieve sig niﬁcantly better accuracy on each task, even with a higher compression ratio, improving the in ference performance with 1.28x to 2.00x speedups. On almost all node-level tasks, our proposed A2Q has negligible accuracy drop compared to the FP32 baselines while achieving 12.1x-18.6x compress ion ratio. Since both GIN and GA T in- volve more complex computations, such as the calculation of attention coefﬁcients in GA T , it is more challenging to quantize those models, and DQ performs p oorly on these two models. How- ever, our method can overcome this problem and maintain comp arable accuracy compared with the FP32 models. Our method can outperform the DQ-INT4 by 11.4% o n the GA T -Cora task with a smaller bitwidth (2.03 v.s. 4). Even on ogbn-arxiv, which ha s a large number of nodes, A2Q can achieve a 12.1x compression ratio compared with FP32 baseli ne with comparable accuracy, which demonstrates the robustness of our method. Moreover, to dem onstrate the generality of our method, we also evaluate our method on heterogeneous graphs and the i nductive learning tasks and compare with more related works in Appendix A.7.1. 4.3 G RA P H -L E V E L TA S K S T able 2 presents the comparison results on the graph-level t asks.

Even for graph datasets with similar in-degrees, s uch as MNIST and CIF AR10, our method also learns the appropriate bitwidths for higher compressi on ratio and better accuracy. Although on GIN-MINST task, the improvement of our method is relatively small due to the similarity of the in- degrees between different nodes, our method can achieve com parable accuracy with smaller bitwidth (3.75 v.s. 4). 4.4 A NA LY S IS T o understand why our approach works, we analyze the relatio nship between the learned bitwidths and the topology of the graph. Figure 4(a) and 4(b) reveal tha t the bitwidth learned by A2Q is strongly related to the topology of graph data in the node-le vel tasks. As the bitwidth increases, the average in-degrees of nodes become larger. In other word s, A2Q method tends to learn higher bitwidth for nodes with higher in-degrees. However, in GA T , as shown in Figure 4(c), the learned bits are irregular. This is because the features aggregated in GA T are topology-free. However, our method can still learn appropriate quantization bitwid ths for different nodes, which improves accuracy while reducing memory usage. In addition, Figure 4 also shows the node distribution for different bitwidths and the result is consistent with power -law distribution. Since nodes in graph data mainly have low in-degrees, most of the nodes are quantized t o low bitwidth ( ≤ 4), compressing the GNNs as much as possible. And there are also some high in-d egree nodes quantized to high bitwidth, which can help to maintain the accuracy of the GNN m odels. As a result, the average bitwidth of the entire graph features is low , and the accurac y degradation is negligible. For the graph-level tasks in which the number of nodes varies , our method is also aggregation- aware. W e select a layer of GIN trained on REDDIT -BINAR Y and a nalyze the relationship between bitwidth and average in-degrees of nodes using the correspo nding bitwidth to quantize in Figure 4(d) and 4(e). It can be seen that the bitwidth learned for nod es features input to the second layer of MLP , which is the update function in GIN for graph-level task s, does not present a correlation with the topology of graph. W e analyze the reason and ﬁnd that the n ode features before the second layer is the result mapped by the ﬁrst layer of MLP and is activated b y the activation function, e.g., ReLU, which results in the node features losing the topology infor mation. W e present more experiment results in Appendix A.7. to demonstrate that our method is ge nerally applicable. 5 A BLATION STUDY The advantage of learning-based mixed-precision quantiza tion: In Figure 5, we compare our A2Q with the manual mixed-precision method, which manually ass igns high-bit to those nodes with high in-degrees and low-bit to those nodes with low in-degre es. In the ﬁgure, the postﬁx “learn” denotes that using A2Q method, “manual” denotes that we assign bits to nodes and the model only learns the stepsize, and “mixed-precision” denotes that th e model uses the same quantization method as DQ-INT4 but assigning different bitwidths to nodes. For t he “mixed-precision”, we assign 5bits to those nodes with 50% top in-degrees and assign 3bits to oth ers. The implications are two-fold. First, compared with the DQ-INT4, which uses the same quanti zation bitwidth, the mixed-precision 8Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 T able 3: Ablation Study.

Second, the results of the learning metho d outperform the manual method on all tasks. Especially for the models with a high compression ratio, on GIN-CiteSeer task, learning method can achieve 21.5% higher accuracy. This demonstrate s that our learning method can perform better than the assignment method according to prior knowle dge for mixed-precision quantization of GNNs. The power of learning the quantization parameters:Ablations of two quantization parameters (s, b) on the GIN-Cora task are reported in the ﬁrst row of T able 3. Th e “no-lr” denotes that do not use learning method, “no-lr-b” denotes that only learn the s tep size s , “no-lr-s” denotes that only learn the bitwidths b, and “lr-all” denotes that learn the bitwidth and step size s imultaneously. W e can see that learning the step size can signiﬁcantly increas e the accuracy and even the “no-lr-bit” model can outperform the DQ-INT4 at the same compression rat io. When learning the bitwidth and step size simultaneously, the model can achieve higher accu racy with a higher compression ratio. This is because our method learns lower bitwidths for most no des with low in-degrees and higher bitwidths for a tiny fraction of nodes with high in-degrees, which can improve the compression ratio while achieving higher accuracy. Local Gradient v .s. Global Gradient:T o demonstrate the effectiveness of our Local Gradient method, we compare the models trained with and without it on t he GCN-CiteSeer task in the last row of T able 3. The “Global” denotes that the model is trained with Eq. 3 and Eq. 4. The model trained with the local method outperforms the global method by 13.8% with a higher compression ratio. This is because the Local Gradient method can learn qu antization parameters for all nodes, while only quantization parameters for a part of nodes can be updated with the Global Gradient method due to the extreme sparse connection in the graph on th e node-level semi-supervised tasks. The overhead of Nearest Neighbor Strategy:W e evaluate the real inference time of the GIN model on the 2080ti GPU. On REDDIT -BINAR Y task, the model without t he selection process requires 121.45ms, while it takes 122.60ms for the model with our Near est Neighbor Strategy, which only introduces 0.95% overhead. But with the help of the Nearest N eighbor Strategy, our model can obtain 19.3% accuracy gains for quantized GIN on REDDIT -BIN AR Y . 6 C ONCLUSIO N This paper proposes A2Q, an aggregation-aware mixed-precision quantization meth od for GNNs, and introduces the Local Gradient and Nearest Neighbor Stra tegy to generalize A2Q to the node- level and graph-level tasks, respectively. Our method can l earn the quantization parameters for different nodes by fully utilizing the property of GNNs and g raph data. The model quantized by our A2Q can achieve up to a 18.6x compression ratio, and the accuracy degradation is negligible compared with the FP32 baseline. Compared with the prior SOT A, DQ-INT4, our method can signiﬁcantly improve 11.4% accuracy with up to a 2.00x speed up on different tasks. Our work provides a general, robust and feasible solution to speed up the inference of GNNs. 9Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 REFERENC ES Radhakrishna Achanta, Appu Shaji, Kevin Smith, Aurelien Lu cchi, Pascal Fua, and Sabine S ¨ usstrunk.

A.1.1 Q UA N T IZ AT IO N PRO CE S S For a vector x, the xq is a quantized representation. Given the quantization step size s, s ∈ R+, and the quantization bitwidth b, b ∈ N+, then the uniform quantization is implemented as: ¯x = sign(x)      ⌊|x| s + 0. 5⌋, |x| < s (2b−1 − 1) 2b−1 − 1, |x| ≥ s(2b−1 − 1) . (9) The x at 32bits is mapped to the integer number set {−2b−1 + 1 , ..., 0, ..., 2b−1 − 1} where the bitwidth is #b bits, and the quantized representation can be calculated as xq = s · ¯x. For inference, ¯x can be used to compute matrix multiplication in the update ph ase or perform other computations in GNNs layers and the output of these computations then are r escaled by the corresponding s using a relatively lower cost scalar-vector multiplication. As a n illustrative example, for vectors x ∈ R3×1 and y ∈ R3×1, the quantization parameters are both s = 0 . 1, b = 5 , the process of inner product between these two vectors by integers is shown in Figure 6. Wh en the values in a vector are all non-negative, we do not need to represent the sign bit in the ﬁ xed-point representation. Therefore, the value can use #b bits to quantize instead of using the ﬁrst bit to represent th e sign bit. Then the quantization range of uniform quantization is [−s(2b − 1), s (2b − 1)]. 0.11 - 0.21 1.29 0.31  0.58 -0.27  -0.436 1 - 2 13  3 6 -3 -48   ! = 0.1  \" = 0.1Preform by float-point representation  Perform by integers representation  -48  Rescale  -48  ! \" -0.48  × = × = × = 0.11 (0.11) 0.5 1 0.1 sign ê ú ´ + = ê ú  ë û  0.21( 0.21) 0.5 2 0.1sign ê - ú - ´ + = - ê ú  ë û  5 1 0.1 (2 1) 1.5 -´ - =  Quantization process  Figure 6: An example of performing inner product by integers representation. A.1.2 G RA D IE N T IN BACK P RO PAG AT IO N Due to the ﬂoor function used in the quantization process is n ot differentiable, the gradient of xq with respect to x vanishes almost everywhere, which makes it impossible to tr ain the model by the backpropagation algorithm. Therefore, we use the straight -through estimator (Bengio et al., 2013) to approximate the gradient through the ﬂoor function, i.e., ∂L ∂x = ∂L ∂x q I|x|≤s(2b−1), where I|x|≤s(2b−1) is a indicator function, whose value is 1 when |x| ≤ s(2b − 1), and vice versa. In our paper, the quantiﬁcation parameters (s, b ) are learnable, the gradients of xq w .r.t. (s, b ) used in Eq. 3 and Eq. 4 are:   ∂x q ∂s ∂x q ∂b  =        [ 1 s (xq − x) 0 ] , |x| < s (2b−1 − 1) sign(x) [ ( 2b−1 − 1 ) 2b−1 ln (2) s ] , |x| ≥ s(2b−1 − 1) .

A graph G = ( V, E) consist of nodes V = {1, ..., N } and edges E ⊆ V × V has node features X ∈ RN×F and optionally H-dimensional edge features E ∈ RE×H . The MPNN framework can be formulated by x(l) i = γ(l)(x(l−1) i , □ j∈N (i) φ(l)(x(l−1) i , x(l−1) j , e(l−1) ij )), where φ is a differentiable kernel function, □ is the aggregation function which is permutation-invarian t, and the γ is a learnable update function, xi is the features of node i and eij is the features of edge between node i and j, N (i) = {j : ( i, j ) ∈ E} , and l represents the l-th layer of the GNNs. In this paper, we focus on three typical GNN models whose forw ardpass all can be represented by the MPNN framework, Graph Convolution Network (GCN) (Kip f & W elling, 2016), Graph Iso- morphism Network (GIN) (Xu et al., 2018), and Graph Attentio n Network (GA T) (V eliˇ ckovi´ c et al., 2017). the detailed information is shown in T able 4. A.3 P RO O F S O F TH E O RE T ICA L RE S U LT S This section provides formal proof of the theoretical resul ts of our paper. A.3.1 N OTAT IO N S Here, we deﬁne the notations utilized in our proof. A = {0, 1}N×N is the adjacency matrix that indicates whether there is an edge between each pair of nodes , e.g., if there is an edge between node i and node j, then aij = 1 , otherwise, aij = 0 . Then, ˜A = A + I is the adjacency matrix for a graph 14Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 that is added to the self-loops. The degree matrix D = diag(d1, d 2, ..., d n), where di = ∑ j aij and the degree matrix for the graph having self-loops is ˜D = ( ˜d1, ˜d2, ..., ˜dn), where ˜di = ∑ j ˜aij. A.3.2 P RO O F S Proof 1. The gradients of the loss function with respect to the node fe atures in semi-supervised tasks are most zero. Without loss of generality, we use the GCN model as an example. From the T able 4, the graph convolution operation can be described as X(l+1) = σ( ˆAX(l)W (l)), (11) where ˆA = ˜D− 1 2 ˜A ˜D− 1 2 , is the normalized adjacency matrix, W (l) ∈ RFin×Fout is a learnable weight matrix in the l-th layer of GCN. X(l) is the input of the l-th layer and the output of the (l − 1)-th layer in GCN. σ is the non-linear activation function, e.g., ReLU. Note tha t the ˆA is an extreme sparse matrix for node-level datasets in our paper. In our training process of the model, we usenll loss as our task loss function L. Only the nodes in the train set T have labels. For the last layer of GCN, we get the node feature s to be classiﬁed by H(l+1) = softmax(X(l+1)). Then the gradient of L with respect to X(l+1) is G1 = ∇X(l+1) L = ∂L ∂H(l+1) · ∂H(l+1) ∂X(l+1) = [ lij ] ∈ RN×Fout , (12) where only the G1 i,:, i ∈ T is not zero, otherwise, G1 i,: = 0 . Then, the gradient of the loss function with respect to X(l) is G2 = ∇X(l) L = ˆAT (∇X(l+1) L ⊙ σ′( ˆAX(l)W (l)))(W (l))T . (13) For node j do not have an edge with the node i, i ∈ T , G2 j,: = 0 . T able 5 lists the density of the adjacency matrix A and the percentage of the labeled nodes in four node-level da tasets. Because the sparsity property of adjacency matrix and the nodes with trained labels only account for a tiny fraction of the graph, the gradients from the loss function f or most node features are zero. Proof 2. The normalized adjacency matrix ˆA is not needed to be quantized for the GCN model. W e take the process of XW → A(XW ) as an illustrative example, which represents ﬁrst calculat e the B = XW and then calculate AB. For the l-th layer of FP32 models, the ﬁrst stage is Bl = XlWl, and then calculate the Xl+1 = ˆABl, where Xl ∈ RN×F1 , Wl ∈ RF1×F2 and A ∈ RN×N . The step-size for Bl, Xl and Wl is SBl , SXl and SWl , respectively. And they are all diagonal matrices. The integer representations are calculated as Bl = Bl qSBl , Xl = SXl Xl q and Wl = Wl qSWl . Note that for the node-level tasks, we can obtain the SBl , SXl and SWl in advance. And for the graph-level tasks, we can obtain them through one mor e element-wise multiplication whose overhead is negligible, as the comparison in T able 6. Then th e ﬁrst stage is: Bl = Xl · Wl = ( SXl · Xl q) · (Wl q · SWl ) , (14) and there exists Bl = Bl qSBl . Therefore, the integers representation for the next stage can be calculated as: Bl q = BlS−1 Bl = ( SXl · Xl q) · (Wl q · SWl )S−1 Bl = ( SXl · Xl q) · (Wl q · (SWl S−1 Bl )) = ( SXl ⊗ (SWl S−1 Bl )) ⊙ (Xl q · Wl q) , (15) where the (SXl ⊗ (SWl S−1 Bl )) can be calculated ofﬂine. Then we obtain the ﬁxed-point repr esenta- tion Bl q for the next stage and do not introduce overhead. The process of node degree normalization after the aggregat ion process can be represented as Xl+1 = σ( ˆABl), where ˆA = D− 1 2 ˜AD− 1 2 is the normalized adjacency matrix, and σ is the 15Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Figure 7: The pipeline of the quantization process on our acc elerator. non-linear activation function. D− 1 2 at the right side of ˜A can be fused into the SXl and then calculate Bl q as Eq. 15. Then the features of the (l + 1) -th layer Xl+1 can be obtained as Xl+1 = σ(D− 1 2 ˜ABl q). And there exits Xl+1 = SXl+1 X(l+1) q. Therefore, the X(l+1) q can be obtained as: X(l+1) q = S−1 Xl+1 Xl+1 = S−1 Xl+1 σ(D− 1 2 ˜ABl q) . (16) Note that the elements in diagonal matrix SXl+1 are all positive because this matrix is made up of step-size, which is always positive. Then we can obtain X(l+1) q = σ(S−1 Xl+1 D− 1 2 ˜ABl q) , where S−1 Xl+1 D− 1 2 can be obtained before inference and ˜A ∈ { 0, 1}N×N . The computation of ˜ABl q only has addition operations and the S−1 Xl+1 D− 1 2 can be obtained before inference for node-level tasks or introduce only once more element-wise multiplication to ca lculate for the graph-level tasks. The D− 1 2 at the left side is fused into the element-wise multiplicati on performed by the next layer and the D− 1 2 at the right side is fused into the element-wise multiplicat ion performed by the current layer and the element-wise multiplication is a necessary st age in the quantized model. Therefore, we can perform the node degree normalization using ﬁxed point a ddition operation instead of quantizing the normalized adjacency matrix which may introduce more qu antization error. Proof 3. The quantization process can be fused with Batch Normalizat ion operations. When GNNs have Batch Normalization (BN) Layers, the calcula tion process is as follows (Note that we have fused the mean and standard-deviation with the l earned parameters in BN): Xl+1 = BN (σ( ˆABl q)) = σ( ˆABl q)Y + Z , (17) where Y = diag(y1, y 2, ..., y F2 ) ∈ RF2×F2 , Z = ( z1, z2, ..., zF2 ) ∈ RN×F2 and zi = (θi, θ i, ..., θ i)T ∈ RN among which yi and θi are the BN parameters for the i-th dimension fea- ture of the nodes features. And there exits that Xl+1 = SXl+1 Xl+1 q. Therefore, Xl+1 q = S−1 Xl+1 Xl+1 = S−1 Xl+1 (σ( ˆABl q)Y + Z) = ( S−1 Xl+1 ⊗ Y ) ⊙ (σ( ˆABl q)) + S−1 Xl+1 Z . (18) Through Eq. 18, we can fuse the quantization of the next layer into the BN operation of the cur- rent layer, which will not introduce overhead because the BN layer itself requires ﬂoating point operations. Note that the ﬂoat point operations are also ele ment-wise. 16Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 T able 6: The comparison between ﬁxed-point operations and ﬂ oat-point operations for some tasks using the Nearest Neighbor Strategy.

As t he pipeline is shown in Figure 7, we fuse the (NNS) with the following operations. The ﬁxed-po int results produced by the previous stage are used to ﬁrst multiply the corresponding step-size from the previous stage (an element- wise ﬂoat point multiplication) and then execute the NNS pro cess. After getting the step-size, these features are quantized immediately (an element-wise ﬂoat p oint multiplication). Therefore, through this fusion way, we do not need the extra memory to store a copy of FP32 features. In addition, the overhead of the NNS is from one more element- wise ﬂoat point multiplication and the search process. W e provide a comparison of the number of ﬂ oat-point operations and ﬁxed-point operations for different graph-level tasks in T able 6, wher e ‘Fixed-point’ denotes the ﬁxed-point op- eration, ‘Float-point’ denotes the ﬂoat-point operation a nd the ‘Ratio’ denotes the percentage of the ﬂoat-point operations in the overall process. The extra ﬂoa t-point operations introduced by NNS is only a tiny fraction of the ﬁxed-point operations. On the oth er hand, through our optimized pipeline and the comparator array used in our accelerator the latency introduced by the search process of the NNS can be overlapped. Therefore, the overhead introduced b y NNS is negligible. A.5 D ATA S E T S W e show the statistics for each dataset used in our work in T ab le 7. For datasets in node-level tasks, nodes correspond to documents and edges to citations between them. Node features are a bag-of-words representation of the document. The target is to classify each node in the graph cor- rectly. The Cora, CiteSeer and PubMed are from Y ang et al. (2016). The ogbn-arxiv, ogbl-mag and ogbn-collab are from Hu et al. (2020). The Flickr is from Zeng et al. (2019). The Reddit is from Hamilton et al. (2017). In graph-level tasks, REDDIT -BINARY(Y anardag & V ishwanathan, 2015) is a balanced dataset where each graph corresponds to a n online discussion thread and the nodes correspond to users. There would be an edge between two nodes if at least one of them responded to another’s comment. The task is then to identify whether a given graph belongs to a question/answer-based community or a discussion-based co mmunity The MNIST and CIF AR-10 datasets (Dwivedi et al., 2020) which are often used for imag e classiﬁcation tasks are transformed into graphs in which every node is represented by their super pixel and location, and the edges are constructed by Achanta et al. (2012). The task is to classify the image using its graph representation. The ZINC G ´ omez-Bombarelli et al. (2018) dataset contains graphs re presenting molecules, where each node is an atom. The task is to regress the penalized logP (also called constrained solubility in some works) of a given graph.

(2020) a nd Kipf & W elling (2016) respectively. W e use standard splits for MNIST , CIF AR-10, and ZINC (Dwived i et al., 2020). For Cora, CiteSeer and PubMed, we use the splits used by Y ang et al. (2016). For REDDIT -BINA R Y , we use 10-fold cross-validation. Our data split way is also the same as DQ-I NT4. Figure 9 shows the architectures of the models used in our eva luations, including the layers, the number of hidden units, and whether to use a skip connection. Our method is implemented using PyT orch Geometric (Fey & Lenssen, 2019). W e quantize the same parts as the DQ-INT4 in all models except for the normali zed adjacency matrix in the GCN model, which we have proven that the quantization of this mat rix is not necessary in Appendix A.3.2, proof 2.. The values in the Cora and CiteSeer are all 0 or 1, therefore, we do not quantize the input features for the ﬁrst layer of the GNNs trained on the two data sets as DQ. For all quantized GNNs, we train them by Adam optimizer. The learning rate and the lea rning rate schedule are consistent with their FP32 version. In our method, the quantization par ameters (s, b ) are also learnable, so we set the learning rate for them, including the b for features, s for features, and s for weights. When initializing, the parameters of the models are initial ized as their FP32 version, the quantization bits for all nodes and weight matrixes are initialized by 4bi ts, and the step sizes for node features and weights are initialized by s ∈ N (0. 01, 0. 01) except for the graph-level tasks on GA T , where we initialize the step size by s ∈ U (0, 1). The N is normal distribution and the U is uniform distribution. And for GA T model trained on graph-level data sets, we just learn the quantization bits of the node features, while in the attention coefﬁcients com putation part, we use the exact 4bit to quantize. The batch size is 128 in all graph-level tasks. The results reported in our work for GNNs on Cora, CiteSeer and PubMed are averaged over 100 runs with different seeds, and the resu lts for ogbn-arxiv, MNIST, CIF AR-10and ZINC are averaged over ten runs. The results on REDDIT - BINARY are obtained by 10-fold cross-validation and the split seed is 12345, which is the same as DQ-INT4. All experiments in our paper ran on R TX 2080Ti GPU driven by Ubuntu 18.04. The version of the CUDA and Pytorch are 10.2 and 1.8.0, respectiv ely.

In the model trained by the bit assign- ment method, the bit is not learnable, and other hyperparame ters are all consistent with the model using the A2Q method. For the “GCN-Cora-mixed-precision” and “GIN-Cite Seer-mixed-precision” tasks, we use 3bit and 5bit to quantize the GNNs while keeping the average bitwidth at 4bits. In particular, we assign 5bits to those nodes with 50% top in-de grees and assign 3bits to others. 19Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Figure 9: The model architectures used in our evaluations, t he head number for all GA T models on different tasks are 8.

Local Gradient v .s. Global Gradient:All settings of the model trained by global gradient is consistent with the model trained by local gradient method. The overhead of Nearest Neighbor Strategy:The model, without using the Nearest Neighbor Strategy, selects the quantization parameters according t o their in-degrees. Every in-degree has a corresponding group of quantization parameters. Those nod es whose in-degrees are larger than 1000 will share the same group quantization parameters. In t his way, The quantization parameters used by the nodes features can be determined as soon as the gra ph data is available, without the need for selection during the inference process, and then we can c ompare the overhead introduced by the selection process.

On the GA T -ogbn-arxiv task, our GPU raised the Out Of Memory error, so we do not report the resu lts on the GA T -ogbn-arxiv task. The model quantized by our A2Q method is also signiﬁcantly better than DQ-INT4, which show s that our A2Q is general. W e do not compare with DQ-INT8 because our result s are comparable with the FP32 baseline with a much larger compression ratio than D Q-INT8. W e also show the relationship between bit and average in-deg rees of nodes using the corresponding bitwidth to quantize on more tasks in Figure 10. W e present th e results of the ﬁnal layer of GNNs. The results show that the bitwidth learned by our A2Q method is also aggregation-aware, which means that our method is robust. W e also evaluate the inductive model, GraphSage, on some other node-level tasks to demonstrate the generality of our method on inductive learning tasks. Du e to the sampling operation in the GraphSage model, the subgraph input to the model varies, we a pply our nearest neighbor strategy to these tasks, i.e., GraphSage-Flickr and GraphSage-Reddit . In addition, we evaluate our method on more datasets, such as the ogbn-mag and ogbl-collab. ogbn-m ag is a heterogeneous graph and the ogbl-collab is used for the link prediction tasks. The results of our experiments are presented in T able 9, where we can see that our approach still works well and even brings some generalization performance improvement while signiﬁcantly com- pressing the model size. This also demonstrates that our Nei ghbor Nearest Strategy generalizes well on inductive models for node-level tasks. W e also compare with more quantization methods on GNNs. Zhaoet al. (2020) uses the Network Architecture Search (NAS) to search for the best quantizati on strategy for different components in the GNNs. Brennan et al. (2020) explore the use of half-preci sion (i.e., FP16) in the forward and backward passes of GNNs. T able 10 presents the comparison re sults on various tasks with these two methods. ‘Half-pre’ denotes the method in Brennan et al. (2020), and ‘LPGNAS’ denotes the method in Zhao et al. (2020). The results demonstrate that ou r method achieves better accuracy with a smaller quantization bitwidth on all tasks. A.7.2 G RA P H -L E V E L TA S K S W e propose the Nearest Neighbor Strategy to quantize the nod e features in graph-level tasks, in which the number of nodes input to models is various. In our Ne arest Neighbor Strategy, #m groups quantization parameters (s, b ) should be initialized, and we explore the effect of the value of m on the performance of the quantized model in T able 11 using the G IN trained on REDDIT -BINAR Y dataset. W e can observe that when the value of m is smaller than 800, the accuracy increases as the value of m increases. When the value of m is higher than 800, the performances of the models with different m are similar. However, the models with a larger m are more stable. Moreover, the selection of m may be related to the number of nodes input to the model. Accor ding to our experiments, we ﬁnally select m as 1000 for all graph-level tasks. T able 12 lists the comparison results on GIN-ZINC and GA T -ZI NC. On the regression tasks, our method is also signiﬁcantly better than DQ-INT4. Notably, w e do not learn different bitwidths for the nodes in ZINC datasets due to the similar topology struct ure between nodes. 22Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 T able 12: The results comparison on GIN-ZINC and GA T -ZINC.

Figure 12: The relationship between bit and average in-degr ees of nodes using the corresponding bitwidth to quantize on different layers of GIN trained on CI F AR10. W e also show the relationship between bit and average in-deg ree of nodes using the correspond- ing bit to quantize for more graph-level tasks in different l ayers immediately after the aggregation phase in Figure 11-Figure 16. The quantization bitwidths le arned for graph-level tasks are also aggregation-aware. Because the difference of the in-degre es between different nodes is little in the MNIST and CIF AR10 dataset resulting in the aggregated fe atures are similar between different nodes, the relationship between learned bitwidths and the i n-degrees is irregular in some layers, e.g., the 2-nd layer in GCN trained on MNIST . 23Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023

As shown in T able 13, our method can also maintain the performance with a high compression ratio for the model with different layers compared with the FP32 model. In addition, we observe that the learned quantization bitwidth increases with the number of layers. W e analysis the average bitwidth used by 2nd to 5th layer for t he ﬁve layers GCN model in Figure 17. Our method learns a higher bitwidth for the deeper layer. Due to the over-smooth phenomenon that exists in the deep layer, the embedding features of diff erent nodes are similar in the deep layer. Therefore, we consider the deeper layer may need a higher qua ntization bitwidth to distinguish the embedding features of different nodes. The impact of skip connection on quantization performance:The ﬁrst column denoted by ‘With- out skip connection’ and the second column denoted by ‘With s kip connection’ of 18 present the comparison results for different layers GCN on Cora dataset s without skip connection and with skip connection, respectively. For the model with skip connecti on, our method is also effective. Our method learns a higher bitwidth for the deeper layer. Due to t he over-smooth phenomenon that ex- ists in the deep layer, we consider that the deeper layer may n eed a higher quantization bitwidth to distinguish the embedding features of different nodes. and the higher learned quantization bitwidth for deeper layers also alleviate quantization error. And co mpared to the quantized model with a skip connection, the learned quantization bitwidths are hi gher for the quantized model without skip connection. Figure 18 presents that the quantization error s of the model with skip connection are always higher than the model without skip connection in ever y layer which means that the model without skip connection is more sensitive to the quantizati on error. Therefore, a higher quantization bitwidth is necessary for the model without skip connection to maintain the performance. W e will add these analyses to the appendix in the revision. Scalability for models that use other aggregation functions: T o demonstrate that our method is also helpful to the GNNs using other aggregation functions r ather than the sum function, we replace the aggregation function of the GIN model, which is based on t he MPNN framework with mean and max functions, and we conduct the comparison experiment on t he Cora dataset.

W e analyze the average features for different aggregation functions i n different in-degrees group in Figure 19. The average features of the sum and max functions are highly d ependent on in-degrees. The other insight is that the variance of the features is also highly de pendent on in-degrees. The analysis demonstrates the generality of our approach, w hich can capture differences between nodes introduced by topology information of graphs and comp ress the model size as much as possi- ble while maintaining the performance. A.7.4 C O M PA RIS O N WIT H BINA RY QUA N T IZ AT IO N ME T H O D In this section, we show the advantages of our method over the binary quantization method for GNNs. W e select the binary quantization method in W ang et al. (2021b) as our baseline. W e just ran the experiments on the node-level because the binary quanti zation method only supports node-level tasks, which is one of the drawbacks of the binary quantizati on method in GNNs. W e quantize the same part as W ang et al. (2021b) does for a fair comparison. The comparison results are shown in T able 16. The binary quantization method performs well on GCN, where the aggregation and update phases are simple. How ever, on both models, GA T and GIN, the accuracy drops signiﬁcantly compared with the FP32 baseline, which makes the deploy- ment unrealistic. However, our method is immune to this prob lem, although it has to use a higher average bit for node features which we believe is necessary f or GA T and GIN. In summary, our method outperforms the binary quantization method in two wa ys: 1. Our method can quantize more complex GNN models and ensure th e accuracy degradation is negligible compared with the FP32 baseline while achieving a high compression ratio of 13.4x- 19.9x. 2.Our method can be applied to graph-level tasks. However, the binary quantization method can not handle them. 27Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Edge Buffer  Weight Buffer  Output Buffer  Input Buffer  Decode Control Unit  DRAM  Data Control signal  MAC …MAC MAC  MAC …MAC MAC  MAC …MAC MAC  MAC …MAC MAC  PE (a) 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1Features  Weights  = 1 0 1 1023 hh h 1 0 1 1122 hh 1 0 1 1021 hh 1 0 1 1120 hh + + + = 55  0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 + reg  <<  & (b) Figure 20: (a) The overview of our accelerator architecture .

A.7.5 A CCE L E RATO R ARCH IT E CT U RE In this section, we introduce the architecture of our hardwa re accelerator designed for GNN infer- ence. As presented in Section 3.1, we quantize each node feat ure to an appropriate precision and ﬁx the weights to 4bits. T o support mixed-precision computa tion, we adopt bit-serial multipliers at the core. Speciﬁcally, we follow the methodology in Judd et a l. (2016) to only serialize the node features. This way, it takes m cycles to complete the multiplication between an m-bit node feature with a 4bit weight, as shown in Figure 20(b). The product invo lving 2n is implemented by left-shift, i.e., for 2n × a, we can shift a left by n bits to implement the product. T o increase the computationa l throughput, we use 256 × 16 MACs which can process 256 16-dimensional features in paral lel. As shown in Figure 20(a), the compute unit is composed of 256 P rocessing Engines (PEs), each containing a row of 16 MACs. The architecture of the MAC is sho wn in Figure 20(b). The on-chip memory consists of an Edge Buffer, which stores t he adjacency matrix of graphs, a W eight Buffer, which stores the weight of the GNNs, an Input B uffer, and an Output Buffer to store the input features and the output result, and the regis ter of each MAC to store the partial sum. T o reduce data movement in the memory hierarchy, the input bu ffer and output buffer work in a swapped fashion, as the output of the current layer is the inp ut to the next layer. W e set the memory size of Input Buffer, Output Buffer, Edge Buffer, and the W ei ght Buffer to 2MB, 2MB, 256KB, and 256KB, respectively. The overview of our architecture is sh own in Figure 20(a). T o calculate Bl = XlW l, 256 consecutive rows in Xl and a column of W l are mapped onto the MAC array to compute 256 inner products in each phase. T o a chieve this, a column of W l is broadcast and shared among PEs. The results of the inner prod ucts are written to the output buffer, which can be reused to reduce the off-chip DRAM access. The ca lculation of Xl+1 = ABl is also in a inner-product manner. In this scenario, A is a sparse matrix. W e therefore represent A in the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format, where full zero rows or elements of A are eliminated. During inference, consecutive compressed rows of A and a column of Bl are mapped onto the MAC array in each phase. W e also sort the nodes in descending o rder according to their in-degrees, and the nodes with similar in-degrees are processed in paral lel simultaneously to alleviate the load imbalance problem when performing the aggregation operati ons. A.7.6 E N E RG Y EFFICIE N CY ANA LY S IS Our method can save energy cost signiﬁcantly from the follow ing two aspects: 1. By compressing the model size as much as possible, e.g., 18 .6x compression ratio on GCN-Cora as shown in T able 1, our method can signiﬁcantly reduce the me mory footprints. Figure 21 presents the energy table for the 45nm technology node. It shows that m emory access consumes further more energy than arithmetic operations. Therefore, the memory f ootprints domains the energy cost, and then compressing the model can save much energy cost. 2. Through our quantization method and the accelerator, themodel can perform inference using the ﬁxed-point operations instead of ﬂoat-point operations, w hich are much more energy-consuming 28Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Figure 21: The energy table for 45nm technology node(Han et al., 2016; Sze et al., 2020). /uni0000002a/uni00000026/uni00000031/uni00000010/uni00000026/uni00000052/uni00000055/uni00000044/uni0000002a/uni0000002c/uni00000031/uni00000010/uni00000026/uni0000004c/uni00000057/uni00000048/uni00000036/uni00000048/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni0000002a/uni00000024 /uni00000037 /uni00000010/uni00000033/uni00000058/uni00000045/uni00000030/uni00000048/uni00000047/uni0000002a/uni00000026/uni00000031/uni00000010/uni00000030/uni00000031/uni0000002c/uni00000036/uni00000037/uni0000002a/uni00000024 /uni00000037 /uni00000010/uni00000026/uni0000002c/uni00000029 /uni00000024/uni00000035/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni0000002a/uni0000002c/uni00000031/uni00000010/uni00000035/uni00000028/uni00000010/uni00000025/uni0000002c/uni0000002a/uni00000048/uni00000052/uni00000003/uni00000030/uni00000048/uni00000044/uni00000051 /uni00000037 /uni00000044/uni00000056/uni0000004e/uni00000056 /uni00000013 /uni00000018 /uni00000014/uni00000013 /uni00000014/uni00000018 /uni00000015/uni00000013 /uni00000015/uni00000018 /uni00000016/uni00000013 /uni00000016/uni00000018 /uni00000017/uni00000013 /uni00000028/uni00000051/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni0000004a/uni0000005c/uni00000003/uni00000028/uni00000049/uni00000049/uni0000004c/uni00000046/uni0000004c/uni00000048/uni00000051/uni00000046/uni0000005c/uni0000000b/uni00000029/uni0000002f/uni00000032/uni00000033/uni00000056/uni00000012/uni0000002d/uni0000000c /uni00000015/uni00000015/uni00000011/uni00000018× /uni00000016/uni00000016/uni00000011/uni00000014× /uni00000017/uni00000011/uni00000018× /uni00000018/uni00000011/uni00000018× /uni0000001c/uni00000011/uni00000019× /uni0000001b/uni00000011/uni00000017× /uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a× /uni00000014× /uni00000014× /uni00000014× /uni00000014× /uni00000014× /uni00000014× /uni00000014× /uni0000002a/uni00000033/uni00000038 /uni00000024 /uni00000015 /uni00000034 Figure 22: The energy efﬁciency compared with 2080Ti GPU on various tasks. than ﬁxed-point operations. As shown in Figure 21, the 32bit ﬂoat MUL T consumes 18.5x energy compared to the 8bit int MUL T . Therefore, our method’s energ y consumption is much lower than the FP32 model. T o illustrate the advantage of our approach in terms of energy efﬁciency, we compare our accelerator with the 2080Ti GPU on various tasks. T o estimate the energy e fﬁciency of GPU, we use the nvidia- smi to obtain the power of GPU when performing the inference and m easure the inference time by time function provided by Python. Then we can get the energy cost o f GPU. W e also model the energy cost of our method on the accelerator. W e use High Band width Memory (HBM) as our off- chip storage. Then we count the number of integer operations , and ﬂoating point operations, and the number of accesses to SRAM and HBM when performing the inf erence process of the quantized models on our accelerator. Based on the data in T able 21, we es timate the energy consumed by ﬁxed- point operations and ﬂoating-point operations. The static and dynamic power of SRAM is estimated using CACTI 7.0(Balasubramonian et al., 2017). The energy o f HBM 1.0 is estimated with 7 pJ/bit as in (O’Connor, 2014). Figure 22 presents these results, wh ich shows that the the energy efﬁciency of our method is signiﬁcantly better than GPU. A.8 C O M P L E X IT Y ANA LY S IS In this section, we provide the analysis of the complexity of our proposed A2Q method, including the computational complexity and space complexity. Space Complexity:When analyzing the space complexity, we use the data size of t he node features as an approximation of the entire loaded data, including wei ghts and features, because the node features account for more than 90% of the overall memory cons umption for a GNN model. For a GNN has L layers, we assume that the input data to the ﬁrst laye r is X ∈ RN×F0 , and the dimension of the hidden features is F1. Then the dimension of the input to the 2-(L-1) layer is N × F1. After quantizing the model, the average bits of the feature maps ar e bm. The memory size includes two parts: 1. the nodes features bm[NF0 + ( L − 1)NF1]. 2. the quantization step size (a step size is a ﬂoat-point number which is 32bit) for each node 32NL. Therefore, the space complexity of the overall GNN model is as follows: M = bm[NF0 + (L − 1)NF1] + 32 NL. (19) W e can also obtain the ratio of the memory consumption of the s tep size in overall memory size: r = 32NL bm[NF0 + (L − 1)NF1]. (20) In the node-level tasks, the F0 is usually much larger than 32, e.g., 3703 in the CiteSeer dat aset. Moreover, in the graph-level tasks, we usually set m = 1000 , which is much smaller than the number of the input nodes to models, i.e., N. Therefore, alth ough our method learns the quantization step size for each node the memory overhead introduced by the quantization step size is negligible. Computational Complexity: The forward pass is divided into the aggregation and update p hases according to the MPNN framework. The aggregation phase can b e represented as Hl = ˆAXl, 29Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 and then the update phase calculates Xl+1 = HlW l. For ˆA ∈ RN×N , Xl ∈ RN×F1 , and W l ∈ RF1×F2 , the computational complexity of the FP32 models is O(N2F1 + NF1F2), which are all the ﬂoat-point operations. After quantizing the mod el, the ﬂoat-point matrix multiplication can be replaced by integer multiplication, and the element- wise operation, which calculates the mul- tiplication between integers and ﬂoat-point numbers accor ding to the Eq. 2. Then the computational complexity is C = OI (N2F1 + NF1F2) + OE (NF2), (21) where OI represents the complexity of the integers multiplication, whose cost is much lower than the ﬂoat-point operations, and the OE represents the complexity of the element-wise operations. Note that although we quantize each node features by different st ep size, the complexity of element-wise operation involving ﬂoat-point is the same as the DQ-INT4 be cause the number of element-wise operations is equal to the number of the elements in a feature map, i.e., N × F2. 30",

For instance, graph neural networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on learning tasks such as node classiﬁcation, link and graph property prediction, with applications ranging from drug design [ 8], social networks [ 11], transaction networks [16], gene expression networks [9], and knowledge graphs [19]. One major challenge of training GNNs comes from the requirements of heavy ﬂoating point operations and large memory footprints, due to the recursive expansions over the neighborhoods. For a minibatch with a single vertex vi, to compute its embedding h(L) i at the L-th layer, we have to expand its neighborhood from the (L−1)-th layer to the 0-th layer, i.e. L-hops neighbors. That will soon cover ∗Equal Contribution. Preprint. Under review. arXiv:2006.05806v2  [cs.LG]  11 Jun 2020a large portion of the graph if particularly the graph is dense. One basic idea of alleviating such “neighbor explosion” problem was to sample neighbors in a top-down manner, i.e. sample neighbors in the l-th layer given the nodes in the (l+ 1)-th layer recursively. Several layer sampling approaches [11, 6, 14, 25] have been proposed to alleviate above “neighbor explosion” problem and improve the convergence of training GCNs, e.g. with importance sampling. However, the optimal sampler [14], q⋆ ij = αij∥h(l) j ∥2 ∑ k∈Ni αik∥h(l) k ∥2 for vertex vi, to minimize the variance of the estimator ˆh(l+1) i involves all its neighbors’ hidden embeddings, i.e.{ˆh(l) j |vj ∈Ni}, which is infeasible to be computed because we can only observe them partially while doing sampling. Existing approaches [6, 14, 25] typically compromise the optimal sampling distribution via approximations, which may impede the convergence. Moreover, such approaches are not applicable to more general cases where the weights or kernelsαij’s are not known a priori, but are learned weights parameterized by attention functions [22]. That is, both the hidden embeddings and learned weights involved in the optimal sampler constantly vary during the training process, and only part of the unnormalized attention values or hidden embeddings can be observed while do sampling. Present work. We derive novel variance reduced samplers for training of GCNs and attentive GNNs with a fundamentally different perspective. That is, different with existing approaches that need to compute the immediate sampling distribution, we maintain nonparametric estimates of the sampler instead, and update the sampler towards optimal variance after we acquire partial knowledges about neighbors being sampled, as the algorithm iterates. To fulﬁl this purpose, we formulate the optimization of the samplers as a bandit problem, where the regret is the gap between expected loss (negative reward) under current policy (sampler) and expected loss with optimal policy. We deﬁne the reward with respect to each action, i.e. the choice of a set of neighbors with sample size k, as the derivatives of the sampling variance, and show the variance of our samplers asymptotically approaches the optimal variance within a factor of3. Under this problem formulation, we propose two bandit algorithms. The ﬁrst algorithm based on multi-armed bandit (MAB) chooses k < Karms (neighbors) repeatedly. Our second algorithm based on MAB with multiple plays chooses a combinatorial set of neighbors with size konly once. To summarize, ( 1) We recast the sampler for GNNs as a bandit problem from a fundamentally different perspective. It works for GCNs and attentive GNNs while existing approaches apply only to GCNs. ( 2) We theoretically show that the regret with respect to the variance of our estimators asymptotically approximates the optimal sampler within a factor of 3 while no existing approaches optimize the sampler. ( 3) We empirically show that our approachs are way competitive in terms of convergence and sample variance, compared with state-of-the-art approaches on multiple public datasets. 2 Problem Setting Let G= (V,E) denote the graph with N nodes vi ∈V, and edges (vi,vj) ∈E. Let the adjacency matrix denote as A∈RN×N. Assuming the feature matrix H(0) ∈RN×D(0) with h(0) i denoting the D(0)-dimensional feature of node vi. We focus on the following simple but general form of GNNs: h(l+1) i = σ ( N∑ j=1 α(vi,vj) h(l) j W(l) ) , l = 0,...,L −1 (1) where h(l) i is the hidden embedding of node vi at the l-th layer, ααα= (α(vi,vj)) ∈RN×N is a kernel or weight matrix, W(l) ∈RD(l)×D(l+1) is the transform parameter on the l-th layer, and σ(·) is the activation function. The weight α(vi,vj), or αij for simplicity, is non-zero only if vj is in the 1-hop neighborhood Ni of vi. It varies with the aggregation functions [ 3, 23]. For example, (1) GCNs [8, 15] deﬁne ﬁxed weights as ααα= ˜D−1 ˜Aor ααα= ˜D−1 2 ˜A˜D−1 2 respectively, where ˜A= A+I, and ˜Dis the diagonal node degree matrix of ˜A. (2) The attentive GNNs [22, 17] deﬁne a learned weight α(vi,vj) by attention functions: α(vi,vj) = ˜α(vi,vj;θ)∑ vk∈Ni ˜α(vi,vk;θ) , where the unnormalized attentions ˜α(vi,vj; θ) = exp(ReLU(aT[Whi∥Whj])), are parameterized by θ= {a,W}. Different 2from GCNs, the learned weights αij ∝˜αij can be evaluated only given all the unnormalized weights in the neighborhood. The basic idea of layer sampling approaches [11, 6, 14, 25] was to recast the evaluation of Eq. (1) as ˆh(l+1) i = σ ( N(i) Epij [ ˆh(l) j ] W(l) ) , (2) where pij ∝αij, and N(i) =∑ jαij. Hence we can evaluate each node vi at the (l+ 1)-th layer, using a Monte Carlo estimator with sampled neighbors at the l-th layer. Without loss of generality, we assume pij = αij and N(i) = 1that meet the setting of attentive GNNs in the rest of this paper. To further reduce the variance, let us consider the following importance sampling ˆh(l+1) i = σW(l) ( ˆµ(l) i ) = σW(l) ( Eqij [αij qij ˆh(l) j ]) , (3) where we use σW(l) (·) to include transform parameter W(l) into the function σ(·) for conciseness. As such, one can ﬁnd an alternative sampling distribution qi = (qij1 ,...,q ij|Ni|) to reduce the variance of an estimator, e.g. a Monte Carlo estimator ˆµ(l) i = 1 k ∑k s=1 αijs qijs ˆh(l) js , where js ∼qi. Take expectation overqi, we deﬁne the variance of ˆµ(l) i = αijs qijs ˆh(l) js at step tand (l+ 1)-th layer to be: Vt(qi) =E [ˆµ(l) i (t) −µ(l) i (t)  2] = E [αijs(t) qijs h(l) js (t) − ∑ j∈Ni αij(t)h(l) j (t)  2] . (4) Note that αij and h(vj) that are inferred during training may vary over steps t’s. We will explicitly include step tand layer lonly when it is necessary. By expanding Eq. (4) one can write V(qi) as the difference of two terms. The ﬁrst is a function of qi, which we refer to as the effective variance: Ve(qi) = ∑ j∈Ni 1 qij α2 ij∥hj∥2 , (5) while the second does not depend on qi, and we denote it by Vc = ∑ j∈Ni αijhj  2 . The optimal sampling distribution [6, 14] at (l+ 1)-th layer for vertex ithat minimizes the variance is: q⋆ ij = αij∥h(l) j ∥2 ∑ k∈Ni αik∥h(l) k ∥2 . (6) However, evaluating this sampling distribution is infeasible because we cannot have all the knowledges of neighbors’ embeddings in the denominator of Eq.(6). Moreover, the αij’s in attentive GNNs could also vary during the training procedure. Existing layer sampling approaches based on importance sampling just ignore the effects of norm of embeddings and assume theαij’s are ﬁxed during training. As a result, the sampling distribution is suboptimal and only applicable to GCNs where the weights are ﬁxed. Note that our derivation above follows the setting of node-wise sampling approaches [11], but the claim remains to hold for layer-wise sampling approaches [6, 14, 25]. 3 Related Works We summarize three types of works for training graph neural networks. First, several “layer sampling” approaches [11, 6, 14, 25] have been proposed to alleviate the “neigh- bor explosion” problems. Given a minibatch of labeled vertices at each iteration, such approaches sample neighbors layer by layer in a top-down manner. Particularly, node-wise samplers [11] ran- domly sample neighbors in the lower layer given each node in the upper layer, while layer-wise samplers [6, 14, 25] leverage importance sampling to sample neighbors in the lower layer given all the nodes in upper layer with sample sizes of each layer be independent of each other. Empirically, the layer-wise samplers work even worse [5] compared with node-wise samplers, and one can set an appropriate sample size for each layer to alleviate the growth issue of node-wise samplers. In this paper, we focus on optimizing the variance in the vein of layer sampling approaches. Though the 3derivation of our bandit samplers follows the node-wise samplers, it can be extended to layer-wise. We leave this extension as a future work. Second, Chen et al. [5] proposed a variance reduced estimator by maintaining historical embeddings of each vertices, based on the assumption that the embeddings of a single vertex would be close to its history. This estimator uses a simple random sampler and works efﬁcient in practice at the expense of requiring an extra storage that is linear with number of nodes. Third, two “graph sampling” approaches [7, 24] ﬁrst cut the graph into partitions [ 7] or sample into subgraphs [24], then they train models on those partitions or subgraphs in a batch mode [ 15]. They show that the training time of each epoch may be much faster compared with “layer sampling” approaches. We summarize the drawbacks as follows. First, the partition of the original graph could be sensitive to the training problem. Second, these approaches assume that all the vertices in the graph have labels, however, in practice only partial vertices may have labels [12, 16]. GNNs Architecture.For readers who are interested in the works related to the architecture of GNNs, please refer to the comprehensive survey [23]. Existing sampling approaches works only on GCNs, but not on more advanced architectures like GAT [22]. 4 Variance Reduced Samplers as Bandit Problems We formulate the optimization of sampling variance as a bandit problem. Our basic idea is that instead of explicitly calculating the intractable optimal sampling distribution in Eq. (6) at each iteration, we aim to optimize a sampler or policy Qt i for each vertex iover the horizontal steps 1 ≤t≤T, and make the variance of the estimator following this sampler asymptotically approach the optimum Q⋆ i = argmin Qi ∑T t=1 Vt e(Qi), such that ∑T t=1 Vt e(Qt i) ≤c∑T t=1 Vt e(Q⋆ i) for some constant c >1. Each action of policy Qt i is a choice of any subset of neighbors Si ⊂Ni where Si ∼Qt i. We denote Qi,Si(t) as the probability of the action that vi chooses Si at t. The gap to be minimized between effective variance and the oracle is Vt e(Qt i) −Vt e(Q⋆ i) ≤⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩. (7) Note that the function Vt e(Qt i) is convex w.r.t Qt i, hence for Qt i and Q⋆ i we have the upper bound derived on right hand of Eq. (7). We deﬁne this upper bound as regret at t, which means the expected loss (negative reward) with policy Qt i minus the expected loss with optimal policy Q⋆ i. Hence the reward w.r.t choosing Si at tis the negative derivative of the effective varianceri,Si(t) = −∇Qi,Si(t)Vt e(Qt i). In the following, we adapt this bandit problem in the adversary bandit setting [1] because the rewards vary as the training proceeds and do not follow a priori ﬁxed distribution [4]. We leave the studies of other bandits as a future work. We show in section 6 that with this regret the variances of our estimators asymptotically approach the optimal variance within a factor of 3. Our samplers sample 1-element subset of neighbors k times or a k-element subset of neighbors once from the alternative sampling distribution qt i = (qij1 (t),...,q ij|Ni|(t)) for each vertex vi. We instantiate above framework under two bandit settings.(1) In the adversary MAB setting [1], we deﬁne the sampler Qt i as qt i, that samples exact anarm (neighbor) vjs ⊂Nifrom qt i. In this case the set Siis the 1-element subset {vjs}. To have a sample size ofkneighbors, we repeat this action ktimes. After we collected krewards rijs(t) =−∇qi,js(t)Vt e(qt i) we update qt i by EXP3 [1]. (2) In the adversary MAB with multiple plays setting [21], it uses an efﬁcient k-combination sampler (DepRound [10]) Qi to sample any k-element subset Si ⊂Ni that satisﬁes ∑ Si:j∈Si Qi,Si = qij,∀vj ∈Ni, where qij corresponds to the alternative probability of sampling vj. As such, it allows us to select from a set of (|Ni| k ) distinct subsets of armsfrom |Ni|arms at once. The selection can be done in O(|Ni|). After we collected the reward −∇Qi,Si(t)Vt e(Qt i), we update qt i by EXP3.M [21]. Discussions. We have to select a sample size of k neighbors in GNNs. Note that in the rigorous bandit setting, exact one action should be made and followed by updating the policy. In adversary MAB, we do the selection ktimes and update the policy, hence strictly speaking applying MAB to our problem is not rigorous. Applying MAB with multiple plays to our problem is rigorous because it allows us to sample k neighbors at once and update the rewards together. For readers who are interested in EXP3, EXP3.M and DepRound, please ﬁnd them in Appendix A. 4Algorithm 1Bandit Samplers for Training GNNs. Require: step T, sample size k, number of layers L, node features H(0), adjacency matrix A. 1: Initialize: qij(1) = 1/|Ni|if j ∈Ni else 0, wij(1) = 1if j ∈Ni else 0. 2: for t= 1to T do 3: Read a minibatch of labeled vertices at layer L. 4: Use sampler qt i or DepRound(k,qt i) to sample neighbors top-down with sample size k. 5: Forward GNN model via estimators deﬁned in Eq.

We show this framework in Algorithm 1. Note that the variance w.r.tqi in Eq. (4) is deﬁned only at the (l+ 1)-th layer, hence we should maintain multiple qi’s at each layer. In practice, we ﬁnd that maintain a single qi and update it only using rewards from the 1-st layer works well enough. The time complexity of our algorithm is same with any node-wise approaches [11]. In addition, it requires a storage in O(|E|) to maintain nonparametric estimates qi’s. It remains to instantiate the estimators, variances and rewards related to our two bandit settings. We name our ﬁrst algorithm GNN-BS under adversary MAB setting, and the second GNN-BS.M under adversary MAB with multiple plays setting. We ﬁrst assume the weights αij’s are ﬁxed, then extend to attentive GNNs that αij(t)’s change. 5.1 GNN-BS: Graph Neural Networks with Bandit Sampler In this setting, we choose 1 arm and repeat ktimes. We have the following Monte Carlo estimator ˆµi = 1 k k∑ s=1 αijs qijs ˆhjs, js ∼qi. (8) This yields the variance V(qi) = 1 k Eqi [ αijs qijs hjs −∑ j∈Ni αijhj  2] . Following Eq. (5) and Eq. (7), we have the reward of vi picking neighbor vj at step tas rij(t) =−∇qij(t)Vt e(qt i) = α2 ij k·qij(t)2 ∥hj(t)∥2. (9) 5.2 GNN-BS.M: Graph Neural Networks with Multiple Plays Bandit Sampler Given a vertex vi, an important property of DepRound is that it satisﬁes ∑ Si:j∈Si Qi,Si = qij,∀vj ∈ Ni, where Si ⊂Ni is any subset of size k. We have the following unbiased estimator. Proposition 1. ˆµi = ∑ js∈Si αijs qijs hjs is the unbiased estimator of µi = ∑ j∈Ni αijhj given that Si is sampled from qi using the DepRound sampler Qi, where Si is the selected k-subset neighbors of vertex i. The effective variance of this estimator is Ve(Qi) =∑ Si⊂Ni Qi,Si∥∑ js∈Si αijs qijs hjs∥2. Since the derivative of this effective variance w.r.t Qi,Si does not factorize, we instead have the following approximated effective variance using Jensen’s inequality. Proposition 2. The effective variance can be approximated by Ve(Qi) ≤∑ js∈Ni αijs qijs ∥hjs∥2. 5Table 1: Dataset summary. “s” dontes multi-class task, and “m” denotes multi-label task.

Follow EXP3.M we use the reward w.r.t each arm asrij(t) = αij qij(t)2 ∥hj(t)∥2,∀j ∈Si. Our proofs rely on the property of DepRound introduced above. 5.3 Extension to Attentive GNNs In this section, we extend our algorithms to attentive GNNs. The issue remained is that the attention value αij can not be evaluated with only sampled neighborhoods, instead, we can only compute the unnormalized attentions ˜αij. We deﬁne the adjusted feedback attention values as follows: α′ ij = ∑ j∈Si qij · ˜αij∑ j∈Si ˜αij , (10) where ˜αij’s are the unnormalized attention values that can be obviously evaluated when we have sampled (vi,vj). We use ∑ j∈Si qij as a surrogate of ∑ j∈Si ˜αij ∑ j∈Ni ˜αij so that we can approximate the truth attention values αij by our adjusted attention values α′ ij. 6 Regret Analysis As we described in section 4, the regret is deﬁned as ⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩. By choosing the reward as the negative derivative of the effective variance, we have the following theorem that our bandit sampling algorithms asymptotically approximate the optimal variance within a factor of 3. Theorem 1. Using Algorithm 1 with η= 0.4 and δ= √ (1−η)η4k5 ln(n/k) Tn4 to minimize the effective variance with respect to {Qt i}1≤t≤T, we have T∑ t=1 Vt e(Qt i) ≤3 T∑ t=1 Vt e(Q⋆ i) + 10 √ Tn4 ln(n/k) k3 (11) where T ≥ln(n/k)n2(1 −η)/(kη2), n= |Ni|. Our proof follows [18] by upper and lower bounding the potential function. The upper and lower bounds are the functions of the alternative sampling probability qij(t) and the reward rij(t) respec- tively. By multiplying the upper and lower bounds by the optimal sampling probability q⋆ i and using the reward deﬁnition in (9), we have the upper bound of the effective variance. The growth of this regret is sublinear in terms of T. The regret decreases in polynomial as sample size kgrows. Note that the number of neighbors nis always well bounded in pratical graphs, and can be considered as a moderate constant number. Compared with existing layer sampling approaches [11, 6, 25] that have a ﬁxed variance given the speciﬁc estimators, this is the ﬁrst work optimizing the sampling variance of GNNs towards optimum. We will empirically show the sampling variances in experiments. 7 Experiments In this section, we conduct extensive experiments compared with state-of-the-art approaches to show the advantage of our training approaches. We use the following rule to name our approaches: GNN 6architecture plus bandit sampler. For example, GCN-BS, GAT-BSand GP-BS denote the training approaches for GCN, GAT [22] and GeniePath [17] respectively. The major purpose of this paper is to compare the effects of our samplers with existing training algorithms, so we compare them by training the same GNN architecture. We use the following architectures unless otherwise stated. We ﬁx the number of layers as 2 as in [15] for all comparison algorithms. We set the dimension of hidden embeddings as 16 for Cora and Pubmed, and 256 for PPI, Reddit and Flickr. For a fair comparison, we do not use the normalization layer [2] particularly used in some works [5, 24]. For attentive GNNs, we use the attention layer proposed in GAT. we set the number of multi-heads as 1 for simplicity. We report results on 5 benchmark data that include Cora [20], Pubmed [20], PPI [11], Reddit [11], and Flickr [24]. We follow the standard data splits, and summarize the statistics in Table 1.

(1) GraphSAGE [11] is a node-wise layer sampling approach with a random sampler. (2) FastGCN [6], LADIES [ 25], and AS-GCN [ 14] are layer sampling approaches based on importance sampling. (3) S-GCN [5] can be viewed as an optimization solver for training of GCN based on a simply random sampler. (4) ClusterGCN [7] and GraphSAINT [24] are “graph sampling” techniques that ﬁrst partition or sample the graph into small subgraphs, then train each subgraph using the batch algorithm [15]. (5) The open source algorithms that support the training of attentive GNNs are AS-GCN and GraphSAINT. We denote them as AS-GAT and GraphSAINT-GAT. We do grid search for the following hyperparameters in each algorithm, i.e., the learning rate {0.01,0.001}, the penalty weight on theℓ2-norm regularizers {0,0.0001,0.0005,0.001}, the dropout rate {0,0.1,0.2,0.3}. By following the exsiting implementations2, we save the model based on the best results on validation, and restore the model to report results on testing data in Section 7.1. For the sample size k in GraphSAGE, S-GCN and our algorithms, we set 1 for Cora and Pubmed, 5 for Flickr, 10 for PPI and reddit. We set the sample size in the ﬁrst and second layer for FastGCN and AS-GCN/AS-GAT as 256 and 256 for Cora and Pubmed, 1,900 and 3,800 for PPI, 780 and 1,560 for Flickr, and 2,350 and 4,700 for Reddit. We set the batch size of all the layer sampling approaches and S-GCN as 256 for all the datasets. For ClusterGCN, we set the partitions according 2Checkout: https://github.com/matenure/FastGCN or https://github.com/huangwb/AS-GCN 7to the suggestions [7] for PPI and Reddit. We set the number of partitions for Cora and Pubmed as 10, for ﬂickr as 200 by doing grid search. We set the architecture of GraphSAINT as “0-1-1”3 which means MLP layer followed by two graph convolution layers. We use the “rw” sampling strategy that reported as the best in their original paper to perform the graph sampling procedure. We set the number of root and walk length as the paper suggested. 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5 20.0 Epoch 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation Cora GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN LADIES AS-GCN ClusterGCN GraphSAINT-GCN S-GCN 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5 20.0 Epoch 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90Micro F1 on validation Pubmed GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN LADIES AS-GCN ClusterGCN GraphSAINT-GCN S-GCN 0 20 40 60 80 100 Epoch 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation PPI GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN LADIES AS-GCN ClusterGCN GraphSAINT-GCN S-GCN 2 4 6 8 10 Epoch 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation Reddit GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN LADIES AS-GCN ClusterGCN GraphSAINT-GCN S-GCN 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5 20.0 Epoch 0.350 0.375 0.400 0.425 0.450 0.475 0.500 0.525Micro F1 on validation Flickr GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN LADIES AS-GCN ClusterGCN GraphSAINT-GCN S-GCN 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5 20.0 Epoch 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation Cora GP-BS.M GAT-BS.M GP-BS GAT-BS GraphSAINT-GAT AS-GAT 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5 20.0 Epoch 0.55 0.60 0.65 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90Micro F1 on validation Pubmed GP-BS.M GAT-BS.M GP-BS GAT-BS GraphSAINT-GAT AS-GAT 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Epoch 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation PPI GP-BS.M GAT-BS.M GP-BS GAT-BS GraphSAINT-GAT AS-GAT 2 4 6 8 10 Epoch 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation Reddit GP-BS.M GAT-BS.M GP-BS GAT-BS GraphSAINT-GAT Figure 1: The convergence on validation in terms of epochs. 7.1 Results on Benchmark Data We report the testing results on GCN and attentive GNN architectures in Table 2 and Table 3 respectively. We run the results of each algorithm3 times and report the mean and standard deviation. The results on the two layer GCN architecture show that our GCN-BS performs the best on most of datasets. The results on the two layer attentive GNN architecture show the superiority of our algorithms on training more complex GNN architectures. GraphSAINT or AS-GAT cannot compute the softmax of learned weights, but simply use the unnormalized weights to perform the aggregation. As a result, most of results from AS-GAT and GraphSAINT-GAT in Table 3 are worse than their results in Table 2. Thanks to the power of attentive structures in GNNs, our algorithms perform better results on PPI and Reddit compared with GCN-BS, and signiﬁcantly outperform the results from AS-GAT and GraphSAINT-GAT. 7.2 Convergence In this section, we analyze the convergences of comparison algorithms on the two layer GCN and attentive GNN architectures in Figure 1 in terms of epoch. We run all the algorithms3 times and show the mean and standard deviation. Our approaches consistently converge to better results with faster 3Checkout https://github.com/GraphSAINT/ for more details. 8rates and lower variances in most of datasets like Pubmed, PPI, Reddit and Flickr compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. The GNN-BS algorithms perform very similar to GNN-BS.M, even though strictly speaking GNN-BS does not follow the rigorous MAB setting. Furthermore, we show a huge improvement on the training of attentive GNN architectures compared with GraphSAINT-GAT and AS-GAT. The convergences on validation in terms of timing (seconds), compared with layer sampling approaches, in Appendix C.1 show the similar results. We further give a discussion about timing among layer sampling approaches and graph sampling approaches in Appendix C.2. 3 5 7 10 Sample Size 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Micro F1 on test FastGCN LADIES AS-GCN GraphSAGE S-GCN GCN-BS AS-GAT GP-BS 3 5 7 10 Sample Size 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0Variance FastGCN LADIES AS-GCN GraphSAGE S-GCN GCN-BS AS-GAT GP-BS Figure 2: Comparisons on PPI by varying the sample sizes: ( left) F1 score, (right) sample variances. 7.3 Sample Size Analysis We analyze the sampling variances and accuracy as sample size varies using PPI data. Note that existing layer sampling approaches do not optimize the variances once the samplers are speciﬁed. As a result, their variances are simply ﬁxed [25], while our approaches asymptotically appoach the optimum. For comparison, we train our models until convergence, then compute the average sampling variances. We show the results in Figure 2. The results are grouped into two categories, i.e. results for GCNs and attentive GNNs respectively. The sampling variances of our approaches are smaller in each group, and even be smaller than the variances of S-GCN that leverages a variance reduction solver. This explains the performances of our approaches on testing Micro F1 scores. We also ﬁnd that the overall sampling variances of node-wise approaches are way better than those of layer-wise approaches. 8 Conclusions In this paper, we show that the optimal layer samplers based on importance sampling for training general graph neural networks are computationally intractable, since it needs all the neighbors’ hidden embeddings or learned weights. Instead, we re-formulate the sampling problem as a bandit problem that requires only partial knowledges from neighbors being sampled. We propose two algorithms based on multi-armed bandit and MAB with multiple plays, and show the variance of our bandit sampler asymptotically approaches the optimum within a factor of 3. Furthermore, our algorithms are not only applicable to GCNs but more general architectures like attentive GNNs. We empirically show that our algorithms can converge to better results with faster rates and lower variances compared with state-of-the-art approaches. References [1] P. Auer, N. Cesa-Bianchi, Y .

Proof. Let us denote Qi,Si as the probability of vertex vi choosing any k-element subset Si ⊂Ni from the K-element set Ni using DepRound sampler Qi. This sampler follows the alternative sampling distribution qi = (qij1 ,...,q ijK ) where qijs denotes the alternative probability of sampling neighbor vjs. This sampler is guaranteed to satisfy ∑ Si:j∈Si Qi,Si = qij, i.e. the sum over the probabilities of all subsets Si that contains element jequals the probability qij.

The effective variance can be approximated by Ve(Qi) ≤∑ js∈Ni αijs qijs ∥hjs∥2. Proof. The variance is V(Qi) =E    ∑ js∈Si αijs qijs hjs − ∑ j∈Ni αijhj  2  = ∑ Si⊂Ni Qi,Si  ∑ js∈Si αijs qijs hjs  2 −  ∑ j∈Ni αijhj  2 .

Lemma 1. For any real value constantη≤1 and any valid distributions Qt i and Q⋆ i we have (1 −2η)Vt e(Qt i) −(1 −η)Vt e(Q⋆ i) ≤⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩+ η⟨Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩ (18) Proof. The function Vt e(Q) is convex with respect to Q, hence for any Qt i and Q⋆ i we have Vt e(Qt i) −Vt e(Q⋆ i) ≤⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩. (19) Multiplying both sides of this inequality by 1 −η, we have (1 −η)Vt e(Qt i) −(1 −η)Vt e(Q⋆ i) (20) ≤⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩−η⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩. (21) In the following, we prove this Lemma in our two bandit settings: adversary MAB setting and adversary MAB with multiple plays setting. In adversary MAB setting, we have ⟨Qt i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩= − ∑ j∈Ni qij(t) α2 ij k·qij(t)2 ∥hj(t)∥2 (22) = −Vt e(Qt i) (23) In adversary MAB with multiple plays setting , we use the approximated effective variance∑ js∈Ni αijs qijs ∥hjs∥2 derived in Proposition 2. For notational simplicity, we denote the approxi- mated effective variance as Ve in the following. We have ⟨Qt i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩= − ∑ Si⊂Ni Qt i,Si ∑ js∈Si αijs qijs(t)2 ∥hjs∥2 (24) = − ∑ js∈Ni αijs qijs(t)2 ∥hjs∥2 ∑ Si:js∈Si Qt i,Si (25) = − ∑ js∈Ni αijs qijs(t)∥hjs∥2 (26) = −Vt e(Qt i). (27) The equation (24) holds because of Proposition 3. 14At last, we conclude the proof (1 −η)Vt e(Qt i) −(1 −η)Vt e(Q⋆ i) (28) ≤⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩−η⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩ (29) = ⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩+ η⟨Q⋆ i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩+ ηVt e(Qt i). (30) Theorem 1. Using Algorithm 1 with η= 0.4 and δ = √ (1 −η)η4k5 ln(n/k)/(Tn4) to minimize effective variance with respect to {Qt i}1≤t≤T, we have T∑ t=1 Vt e(Qt i) ≤3 T∑ t=1 Vt e(Q⋆ i) + 10 √ Tn4 ln(n/k) k3 (31) where T ≥ln(n/k)n2(1 −η)/(kη2) and n= |Ni|. Proof. First we explain why condition T ≥ln(n/k)n2(1 −η)/(kη2) ensures that δˆrij(t) ≤1, δˆrij(t) = √ (1 −η)η4k5 ln(n/k) Tn4 ·αij(t) q3 ij(t) ∥hj(t)∥2 (32) ≤ √ (1 −η)η4k5 ln(n/k) Tn4 · n3 k3η3 (33) ≤1 (34) Assuming ∥hj(t)∥≤ 1, inequality (33) holds because αij(t) ≤1 and qij(t) ≥kη/n. Then replace T by the condition, we get δˆrij(t) ≤1. Let Wi(t), W′ i(t) denote ∑ j∈Ni wij(t), ∑ j∈Ni w′ ij(t) respectively. Then for any t= 1,2,...,T , Wi(t+ 1) Wi(t) = ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i wij(t+ 1) Wi(t) + ∑ j∈Ut i wij(t+ 1) Wi(t) (35) = ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i wij(t) Wi(t) ·exp(δˆrij(t)) + ∑ j∈Ut i wij(t) Wi(t) (36) ≤ ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i wij(t) Wi(t) [ 1 +δˆrij(t) + (δˆrij(t))2] + ∑ j∈Ut i wij(t) Wi(t) (37) = 1 +W′ i (t) Wi(t) ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i wij(t) W′ i (t) [ δˆrij(t) + (δˆrij(t))2] (38) = 1 +W′ i (t) Wi(t) ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)/k−η/n 1 −η [ δˆrij(t) + (δˆrij(t))2] (39) ≤1 + δ k(1 −η) ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆrij(t) + δ2 k(1 −η) ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆr2 ij(t) (40) Inequality (37) uses ea ≤1 +a+ a2 for a≤1. Equality (39) holds because of update equation of qij(t) deﬁned in EXP3.M. Inequality (40) holds because W′ i (t) Wi(t) ≤1. Since 1 +x≤ex for x≥0, we have ln Wi(t+ 1) Wi(t) ≤ δ k(1 −η) ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆrij(t) + δ2 k(1 −η) ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆr2 ij(t) (41) 15If we sum, for 1 ≤t≤T, we get the following telescopic sum ln Wi(T + 1) Wi(1) = T∑ t=1 ln Wi(t+ 1) Wi(t) (42) ≤ δ k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆrij(t) + δ2 k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆr2 ij(t) (43) ≤ δ k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆrij(t) + δ2 k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni qij(t)ˆr2 ij(t) (44) On the other hand, for any subset Scontaining k elements, ln Wi(T + 1) Wi(1) ≥ln ∑ j∈S wij(T + 1) Wi(1) (45) ≥ ∑ j∈S ln wij(T + 1) k −ln n k (46) ≥δ k ∑ j∈S ∑ t:j /∈Ut i ˆrij(t) −ln n k (47) The inequality (46) uses the fact that ∑ j∈S wij(T + 1)≥k( ∏ j∈S wij(T + 1))1/k The equation (47) uses the fact that wij(T + 1) = exp(δ ∑ t:j /∈Ut i ˆrij(t)) From (44) and (47), we get δ k ∑ j∈S ∑ t:j /∈Ut i ˆrij(t) −ln n k ≤ δ k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆrij(t) + δ2 k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni\\Ut i qij(t)ˆr2 ij(t) (48) And we have the following inequality δ k ∑ j∈S ∑ t:j∈Ut i rij(t) = δ k ∑ j∈S ∑ t:j∈Ut i qij(t)ˆrij(t) (49) ≤ δ k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ut i qij(t)ˆrij(t) (50) The equality (49) holds beacuse rij(t) =qijˆrij(t) when j ∈St i and Ut i ⊆St i bacause qt ij = 1for all j ∈Ut i. Then add inequality (50) in (48) we have δ k ∑ j∈S ∑ t:j∈Ut i rij(t) +δ k ∑ j∈S ∑ t:j /∈Ut i ˆrij(t) −ln n k (51) ≤ δ k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni qij(t)ˆrij(t) + δ2 k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni qij(t)ˆr2 ij(t) (52) Given qij(t) we have E[ˆr2 ij(t)] =r2 ij(t)/qij(t), hence, taking expectation of (51) yields that δ k T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈S rij(t) −ln n k ≤ δ k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni qij(t)rij(t) + δ2 k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni r2 ij(t) (53) 16By multiplying (53) by Q⋆ i,S and summing over S, we get δ k T∑ t=1 ∑ S⊂Ni Q⋆ i,S ∑ j∈S rij(t) −ln n k ≤ δ k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni qij(t)rij(t) + δ2 k(1 −η) T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni r2 ij(t) (54) As ∑ j∈Ni qij(t)rij(t) = ∑ j∈Ni ∑ Si:j∈Si Qt i,Sirij(t) (55) = ∑ Si⊂Ni Qt i,Si ∑ j∈Si rij(t) (56) = − ∑ Si⊂Ni Qt i,Si∇Qt i,Si Vt e(Qt i,Si) (57) = −⟨Qt i,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩ (58) By plugging (58) in (54) and rearranging it, we ﬁnd T∑ t=1 ⟨Qt i −Q⋆ i ,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩+ η T∑ t=1 ⟨Q⋆ i ,∇Qt i Vt e(Qt i)⟩ (59) ≤δ T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni r2 ij(t) +(1 −η)k δ ln(n/k) Using Lemma 1, we have (1 −2η) T∑ t=1 Vt e(Qt i) −(1 −η) T∑ t=1 Vt e(Q⋆ i ) ≤δ T∑ t=1 ∑ j∈Ni r2 ij(t) +(1 −η)k δ ln(n/k) (60) Finally, we know that ∑ j∈Ni r2 ij(t) = ∑ j∈Ni αij(t)2 qij(t)4 (61) ≤ ∑ j∈Ni αij(t) n4 k4η4 (becauseqij(t) ≥kη/n) (62) = n4 k4η4 (63) By setting η= 0.4 and δ= √ (1 −η)η4k5 ln(n/k)/(Tn4), we get the upper bound. C Experiments C.1 Convergences We show the convergences on validation in terms of timing (seconds) in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Basically, our algorithms converge to much better results in nearly same duration compared with other “layer sampling” approaches. Note that we cannot complete the training of AS-GAT on Reddit because of memory issues. C.2 Discussions on Timings between Layer Sampling and Graph Sampling Paradigms Note that the comparisons of timing between “graph sampling” and “layer sampling” paradigms have been studied recently in [ 7, 24]. As a result, we do not compare the timing with “graph sampling” approaches. Under certain conditions, the graph sampling approaches should be faster than layer sampling approaches. That is, graph sampling approaches are designed for graph data that all vertices have labels. Under such condition, the ﬂoating point operations analyzed in [7] are 170.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 Time 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8Micro F1 on validation Cora GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN AS-GCN LADIES 5 10 15 20 Time 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90Micro F1 on validation Pubmed GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN AS-GCN LADIES 0 1000 2000 3000 Time 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation PPI GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN AS-GCN LADIES 500 1000 1500 Time 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation Reddit GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN AS-GCN LADIES 100 200 300 400 Time 0.40 0.45 0.50Micro F1 on validation Flickr GCN-BS GraphSAGE FastGCN AS-GCN LADIES Figure 3: The convergence in timing (seconds) on GCNs. 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 Time 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8Micro F1 on validation Cora GP-BS.M GP-BS GAT-BS.M GAT-BS AS-GAT 0 10 20 30 Time 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation Pubmed GP-BS.M GP-BS GAT-BS.M GAT-BS AS-GAT 0 1000 2000 Time 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9Micro F1 on validation PPI GP-BS.M GP-BS GAT-BS.M GAT-BS AS-GAT 100 200 300 Time 0.44 0.46 0.48 0.50Micro F1 on validation Flickr GP-BS.M GP-BS GAT-BS.M GAT-BS AS-GAT Figure 4: The convergence in timing (seconds) on attentive GNNs. maximally utilized compared with the “layer sampling” paradigm. However, in practice, there are large amount of graph data with labels only on some types of vertices, such as the graphs in [ 16]. “Graph sampling” approaches are not applicable to cases where only partial vertices have labels. To summarize, the “layer sampling” approaches are more ﬂexible and general compared with “graph sampling” approaches in many cases. C.3 Results on OGB We report our results on OGB protein dataset [13]. We set the learning rate as 1e-3, batch size as 256, the dimension of hidden embeddings as 64, sample size as 10 and epochs as 200. We save the model based on the best results on validation and report results on testing data. We run the experiment 10 times with different random seeds to compute the average and standard deviation of the results. Our result of GP-BS on protein dataset performs the best4 until we submitted this paper. Please ﬁnd our implementations at https://github.com/xavierzw/ogb-geniepath-bs.

It identifies that existing sampling algorithms for Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are suboptimal and not applicable to general GNNs (e.g., Graph Attention Networks) due to the intractability of computing optimal sampling distributions, which involve dynamically changing node embeddings and learned weights. The main contributions include: (1) Formulating the optimization of GNN samplers as an adversary bandit problem, allowing for a dynamic, nonparametric approach that works for both GCNs and attentive GNNs. (2) Proposing two bandit algorithms, GNN-BS (based on Multi-Armed Bandit) and GNN-BS.M (based on MAB with multiple plays), which acquire partial knowledge from sampled neighbors and iteratively update the sampler towards optimal variance. (3) Theoretically demonstrating that the proposed algorithms asymptotically approach the optimal sampling variance within a factor of 3.

Instead of explicitly calculating the intractable optimal sampling distribution q*ij (which depends on all neighbors' hidden embeddings and learned weights), the approach maintains nonparametric estimates of the sampler and updates them after acquiring partial knowledge from sampled neighbors. The regret is defined as the gap between the expected loss under the current sampler policy and the optimal policy. The reward for choosing a set of neighbors is defined as the negative derivative of the sampling variance. Two bandit algorithms are proposed: (1) GNN-BS: Samples a single neighbor (arm) k times and updates the sampling distribution using the EXP3 algorithm. The reward is calculated as rij(t) = -∇qij(t)Ve(qt i) = α^2ij / (k·qij(t)^2) * ∥hj(t)∥^2. (2) GNN-BS.M: Uses a k-combination sampler (DepRound) to select a k-element subset of neighbors once. It uses an unbiased estimator ˆµi = ∑js∈Si (αijs / qijs) * hjs and an approximated effective variance Ve(Qi) ≤ ∑js∈Ni (αijs / qijs) * ∥hjs∥^2. Rewards for updating are rij(t) = αij / qij(t)^2 * ∥hj(t)∥^2 for j ∈ Si, updated by EXP3.M. For attentive GNNs, adjusted feedback attention values α'ij are introduced to approximate true attention values from unnormalized attentions of sampled neighbors.",
        "experimental_setup": "The experimental evaluation was conducted on two main GNN architectures: GCN and attentive GNNs (GAT and GeniePath). All comparison algorithms used a fixed number of 2 layers. Hidden embedding dimensions were set to 16 for Cora and Pubmed, and 256 for PPI, Reddit, and Flickr. No normalization layer was used, and the number of multi-heads for attentive GNNs was 1. Five benchmark datasets were used: Cora, Pubmed, PPI, Reddit, and Flickr, with standard data splits. Comparison algorithms included: GraphSAGE, FastGCN, LADIES, AS-GCN, S-GCN, ClusterGCN, GraphSAINT, AS-GAT, and GraphSAINT-GAT. Hyperparameters (learning rate, L2-norm regularizers, dropout rate) were tuned via grid search. Sample size 'k' for GraphSAGE, S-GCN, and the proposed algorithms was 1 for Cora/Pubmed, 5 for Flickr, and 10 for PPI/Reddit. Specific sample sizes for FastGCN/AS-GCN/AS-GAT layers were also defined. Batch size for layer sampling approaches and S-GCN was 256. ClusterGCN partitions were set per suggestions or grid search. GraphSAINT used a '0-1-1' architecture with 'rw' sampling. Models were saved based on best validation results, and testing results (Micro F1 scores) were reported. Convergence was analyzed in terms of epochs and timing (seconds). Sample size analysis was performed on PPI. Additional results for GP-BS on the OGB 'ogbn-proteins' dataset were reported with specific hyperparameters (learning rate 1e-3, batch size 256, hidden dims 64, sample size 10, epochs 200).",
        "limitations": "The optimal sampling distribution is computationally intractable due to its dependency on all neighbors' hidden embeddings and learned weights. The initial derivation of the bandit samplers primarily follows node-wise sampling approaches, with a full extension to layer-wise sampling left for future work. The GNN-BS algorithm, which repeats 1-arm sampling 'k' times, is not strictly rigorous under the standard Multi-Armed Bandit setting where an action should ideally be followed by a single policy update. The current problem formulation exclusively uses an adversary bandit setting, and exploring other bandit settings remains a future research direction. Furthermore, 'graph sampling' approaches, while potentially faster in some cases, are limited to scenarios where all vertices have labels, making them less flexible than 'layer sampling' approaches for graphs with partially labeled data.",

(2) Exploring other bandit settings beyond the adversary bandit framework to further optimize sampling strategies. (3) Investigating how the proposed bandit samplers could be integrated with and benefit graph sampling paradigms in scenarios where partial labels are present, potentially combining the strengths of both approaches.",

Our main theorem serves as a stepping stone to studying the learning dynamics of positive homogeneous models with attention mechanisms. 1 Introduction A rapidly growing class of model architectures for graph representation learning are Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [20] which have achieved strong empirical performance across various applications such as social network analysis [8], drug discovery [27], recommendation systems [61], and traffic forecasting [50]. This has driven research focused on constructing and assessing specific architectural designs [59] tailored to various tasks. On the theoretical front, mostly the expressive power [51, 26] and computational capabilities [45] of GNNs have been studied. However, there is limited understanding of the underlying learning mechanics. We undertake a classical variant of GNNs, the Graph Attention Network (GAT) [48, 9]. It overcomes the limitation of standard neighborhood representation averaging in GCNs [29, 22] by employing a self-attention mechanism [47] on nodes. Attention performs a weighted aggregation over a node’s neighbors to learn their relative importance. This increases the expressiveness of the neural network. GAT is a popular model that continues to serve as strong baseline. However, a major limitation of message-passing GNNs in general, and therefore GATs as well, is severe performance degradation when the depth of the network is even slightly increased. SOTA results are reportedly achieved by models of 2 or 3 layers. This problem has largely been attributed to over-smoothing [35], a phenomenon in which node representations become indistinguishable when multiple layers are stacked. To relieve GNNs of over-smoothing, practical techniques inspired by classical deep neural networks tweak the training process, e.g. by normalization [11, 64, 65, 66] or regularization [38, 42, 55, 67], and impose architectural changes such as skip connections (dense 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023). arXiv:2310.07235v2  [cs.LG]  25 Oct 2023and residual) [34, 53] or offer other engineering solutions [ 33] or their combinations [ 12]. Other approaches to overcome over-smoothing include learning CNN-like spatial operators from random paths in the graph instead of the point-wise graph Laplacian operator [ 17] and learning adaptive receptive fields (different ‘effective’ neighborhoods for different nodes) [63, 36, 52]. Another problem associated with loss of performance in deeper networks is over-squashing [1], but we do not discuss it since non-attentive models are more susceptible to it, which is not our focus. Alternative causes for the challenged trainability of deeper GNNs beyond over-smoothing is hampered signal propagation during training (i.e. backpropagation) [25, 62, 13]. To alleviate this problem for GCNs, a dynamic addition of skip connections to vanilla-GCNs, which is guided by gradient flow, and a topology-aware isometric initialization are proposed in [ 25]. A combination of orthogonal initialization and regularization facilitates gradient flow in [21]. To the best of our knowledge, these are the only works that discuss the trainability issue of deep GNNs from the perspective of signal propagation, which studies a randomly initialized network at initialization. Here, we offer an insight into a mechanism that allows these approaches to improve the trainability of deeper networks that is related to the entire gradient flow dynamics. We focus in particular on GAT architectures and the specific challenges that are introduced by attention. Our work translates the concept of neuronwise balancedness from traditional deep neural networks to GNNs, where a deeper understanding of gradient dynamics has been developed and norm balanced- ness is a critical assumption that induces successful training conditions. One reason is that the degree of initial balancedness is conserved throughout the training dynamics as described by gradient flow (i.e. a model of gradient descent with infinitesimally small learning rate or step size). Concretely, for fully connected feed-forward networks and deep convolutional neural networks with continuous homogenous activation functions such as ReLUs, the difference between the squared l2-norms of incoming and outgoing parameters to a neuron stays approximately constant during training [ 15, 32]. Realistic optimization elements such as finite learning rates, batch stochasticity, momentum, and weight decay break the symmetries induced by these laws. Yet, gradient flow equations can be extended to take these practicalities into account [31]. Inspired by these advances, we derive a conservation law for GATs with positive homogeneous activation functions such as ReLUs. As GATs are a generalization of GCNs, most aspects of our insights can also be transferred to other architectures. Our consideration of the attention mechanism would also be novel in the context of classic feed-forward architectures and could have intriguing implications for transformers that are of independent interest. In this work, however, we focus on GATs and derive a relationship between model parameters and their gradients, which induces a conservation law under gradient flow. Based on this insight, we identify a reason for the lack of trainability in deeper GATs and GCNs, which can be alleviated with a balanced parameter initialization. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposal is effective in mitigating the highlighted trainability issues, as it leads to considerable training speed-ups and enables significant parameter changes across all layers. This establishes a causal relationship between trainability and parameter balancedness also empirically, as our theory predicts. The main theorem presented in this work serves as a stepping stone to studying the learning dynamics of positive homogeneous models with attention mechanisms such as transformers [47] and in particular, vision transformers which require depth more than NLP transformers[49]. Our contributions are as follows. • We derive a conservation law of gradient flow dynamics for GATs, including its variations such as shared feature weights and multiple attention heads. • This law offers an explanation for the lack of trainability of deeper GATs with standard initialization. • To demonstrate empirically that our theory has established a causal link between balancedness and trainability, we propose a balanced initialization scheme that improves the trainability of deeper networks and attains considerable speedup in training and convergence time, as our theory predicts. 2 Theory: Conservation laws in GATs Preliminaries For a graph G = (V, E) with node set V and edge set E ⊆ V × V , where the neighborhood of a node v is given as N(v) = {u|(u, v) ∈ E}, a GNN layer computes each node’s representation by aggregating over its neighbors’ representation. In GATs, this aggregation is weighted by parameterized attention coefficients αuv, which indicate the importance of node u for v. 2Table 1: Attributes of init. schemes Init. Feat. Attn. Bal.? Xav Xavier Xavier No XavZ Xavier Zero No BalX Xavier Zero Yes BalO LLortho Zero Yes Figure 1: Params. to balance for neuron i ∈ [nl] Given input representations hl−1 v for all nodes v ∈ V , a GAT 1 layer l transforms those to: hl v = ϕ( X u∈N(v) αl uv · Wl shl−1 u ), where (1) αl uv = exp((al)⊤ · LeakyReLU(Wl shl−1 u + Wl t hl−1 v ))P u′∈N(v) exp((al)⊤ · LeakyReLU(Wlshl−1 u′ + Wl t hl−1v ))) . (2) We consider ϕ to be a positively homogeneous activation functions (i.e ϕ(x) =xϕ′(x) and conse- quently, ϕ(ax) =aϕ(x) for positive scalars a), such as a ReLU ϕ(x) = max{x, 0} or LeakyReLU ϕ(x) = max{x, 0} + −α max{−x, 0}. The feature transformation weights Ws and Wt for source and target nodes, respectively, may also be shared such that W = Ws = Wt. Definition 2.1. Given training data {(xm, ym)}M m=1 ⊂ Rd × Rp for M ≤ V , let f : Rd → Rp be the function represented by a network constructed by stacking L GAT layers as defined in Eq. (1) and (2) with W = Ws = Wt and h0 m = g(xm). Each layer l ∈ [L] of size nl has associated parameters: a feature weight matrix Wl ∈ Rnl×nl−1 and an attention vector al ∈ Rnl, where n0 = d and nL = p. Given a differentiable loss function ℓ : Rd × Rp → R, the loss L = 1/M PM i=1 ℓ(f(xm), ym) is used to update model parameters w ∈ {Wl, al}L l=1 with learning rate γ by gradient descent, i.e., wt+1 = wt − γ∇wL, where ∇wL = [∂L/∂w1, . . . ,∂L/∂w|w|] and w0 is set by the initialization scheme. For an infinitesimal γ → 0, the dynamics of gradient descent behave similarly to gradient flow defined by dw/dt = −∇wL, where t is the continuous time index. We useW[i, :], W[:, i], and a[i] to denote the ith row of W, column of W, and entry ofa, respectively. Note that Wl[i, :] is the vector of weights incoming to neuron i ∈ [nl] and Wl+1[:, i] is the vector of weights outgoing from the same neuron. For the purpose of discussion, let i ∈ [dl], j∈ [dl−1], and k ∈ [dl+1], as depicted in Fig. 1. ⟨·, ·⟩ denotes the scalar product. Conservation Laws We focus the following exposition on weight-sharing GATs, as this variant has the practical benefit that it requires fewer parameters. Yet, similar laws also hold for the non-weight- sharing case, as we state and discuss in the supplement. For brevity, we also defer the discussion of laws for the multi-headed attention mechanism to the supplement. Theorem 2.2 (Structure of gradients). Given the feature weight and attention parameters Wl and al of a layer l in a GAT network as described in Def. 2.1, the structure of the gradients for layer l ∈ [L − 1] in the network is conserved according to the following law: ⟨Wl[i, :], ∇Wl[i,:]L⟩ − ⟨al[i], ∇al[i]L⟩ = ⟨Wl+1[:, i], ∇Wl+1[:,i]L⟩. (3) Corollary 2.3 (Norm conservation of weights incoming and outgoing at every neuron). Given the gradient structure of Theorem 2.2 and positive homogeneity of the activation ϕ in Eq. (1), gradient flow in the network adheres to the following invariance for l ∈ [L − 1]: d dt \u0010\r\rWl[i, :] \r\r2 − \r\ral[i] \r\r2\u0011 = d dt \u0010\r\rWl+1[: i] \r\r2\u0011 , (4) 1This definition of GAT is termed GATv2 in [9]. Hereafter, we refer to GATv2 as GAT. 3(a) δ with GD  (b) δ with Adam  (c) c with Xavier  (d) c with BalO Figure 2: Visualizing conservation laws: (a),(b) show δ ≈ 0 (can not empirically be exactly zero due to finite γ = 0.1) from Eq. (7) for hidden layers when L = 3. (c),(d) show the value of c from Eq. (5), which is determined by the initialization and should be 0 when the network is balanced, for L = 10 trained with GD. With Xav., the network is unbalanced and hence c ̸= 0for all neurons. With BalO, c = 0exactly at initialization for all neurons by design but during training, it varies slightly andc ≈ 0 as the network becomes slightly unbalanced due to the finite γ = 0.1. As both δ and c approximately meet their required value, we conclude that the derived law holds for practical purposes as well. It then directly follows by integration over time that the l2-norms of feature and attention weights incoming to and outgoing from a neuron are preserved such that \r\rWl[i, :] \r\r2 − \r\ral[i] \r\r2 − \r\rWl+1[: i] \r\r2 = c, (5) where c = d dt \u0010\r\rWl[i, :] \r\r2 − \r\ral[i] \r\r2\u0011 at initialization (i.e. t = 0). We denote the ‘degree of balancedness’ by c and call an initialization balanced if c = 0. Corollary 2.4 (Norm conservation across layers). Given Eq. (4), the invariance of gradient flow at the layer level for l ∈ [L − 1] by summing over i ∈ [nl] is: d dt \u0010\r\rWl\r\r2 F − \r\ral\r\r2\u0011 = d dt \u0010\r\rWl+1\r\r2 F \u0011 . (6) Remark 2.5. Similar conservation laws also hold for the original less expressive GAT version [48] as well as for the vanilla GCN [29] yielded by fixing al = 0. Insights We first verify our theory and then discuss its implications in the context of four different initializations for GATs, which are summarized in Table 1. Xavier (Xav.) initialization [19] is the standard default for GATs. We describe the Looks-Linear-Orthogonal (LLortho) initialization later. In order to empirically validate Theorem 2.2, we rewrite Equation 3 to define δ as: δ = ⟨Wl[i, :], ∇Wl[i,:]L⟩ − ⟨al, ∇alL⟩ − ⟨Wl+1[:, i], ∇Wl+1[:,i]L⟩ = 0. (7) We observe how the value of δ varies during training in Fig. 2 for both GD and Adam optimizers with γ = 0.1. Although the theory assumes infinitesimal learning rates due to gradient flow, it still holds sufficiently (δ ≈ 0) in practice for normally used learning rates as we validate in Fig. 2. Furthermore, although the theory assumes vanilla gradient descent optimization, it still holds for the Adam optimizer (Fig. 2b). This is so because the derived law on the level of scalar products between gradients and parameters (see Theorem 2.2) still holds, as it states a relationship between gradients and parameters that is independent of the learning rate or precise gradient updates. Having verified Theorem 2.2, we use it to deduce an explanation for a major trainability issue of GATs with Xavier initialization that is amplified with increased network depth. The main reason is that the last layer has a comparatively small average weight norm, as E \r\rWL[:, i] \r\r2 = 2nL/(nL + nL−1) << 1, where the number of outputs is smaller than the layer width nL << nL−1. In contrast, E \r\rWL−1[i, :] \r\r2 = 2nL−1/(nL−1 + nL−2) = 1 and EaL−1[i]2 = 2/(1 +nL−1). In consequence, the right-hand side of our derived conservation law nL−2X j=1 (WL−1 ij )2 ∇WL−1 ij L WL−1 ij − (aL−1 i )2 ∇aL−1 i L aL−1 i = nLX k=1 (WL ki)2 ∇WL ki L WL ki (8) 4(a) Frac. of sig. params with relative change > 0.05  (b) Rel. grad. norms of feat. wghts. & training curve Figure 3: For L = 5, a high fraction of parameters change, and gradients propagate to earlier layers for both the unbalanced and balanced initialization Xav. and BalO initialization achieve 75.5% and 79.9% test accuracy, respectively.

Note that the balanced initialization in (b) is also able to train faster than the 5 layer network with Xavier initialization in Fig. 3b. is relatively small, as PnL k=1(WL ki)2 << 1, on average, while the weights on the left-hand side are orders of magnitude larger. This implies that the relative gradients on the left-hand side are likely relatively small to meet the equality unless all the signs of change are set in such a way that they satisfy the equality, which is highly unlikely during training. Therefore, relative gradients in layer L −1 and accordingly also the previous layers of the same dimension can only change in minor ways. The amplification of this trainability issue with depth can also be explained by the recursive substitu- tion of Theorem 2.2 in Eq. (8) that results in a telescoping series yielding: n1X j=1 n0X m=1 W(1) jm 2 ∇W(1) jm L W(1) jm − L−1X l=1 nlX o=1 a(l) o 2 ∇a(l) o L a(l) o = nL−1X i=1 nLX k=1 W(L) ki 2 ∇W(L) ki L W(L) ki (9) Generally, 2n1 < n0 and thus E \r\rW1[j :] \r\r2 = 2n1/(n1 + n0) < 1. Since the weights in the first layer and the gradients propagated to the first layer are both small, gradients of attention parameters of the intermediate hidden layers must also be very small in order to satisfy Eq. (9). Evidently, the problem aggravates with depth where the same value must now be distributed over the parameters and gradients of more layers. Note that the norms of the first and last layers are usually not arbitrary but rather determined by the input and output scale of the network. Analogously, we can see see how a balanced initialization would mitigate the problem. Equal weight norms \r\rWL−1[i, :] \r\r2 and \r\rWL[:, i] \r\r2 in Eq. (8) (as the attention parameters are set to 0 during balancing, see Procedure 2.6) would allow larger relative gradients in layerL − 1, as compared to the imbalanced case, that can enhance gradient flow in the network to earlier layers. In other words, gradients on both sides of the equation have equal room to drive parameter change. 5Figure 5: Relative gradient norms of feature (left axis, solid) and of attention (right axis, stylized) parameters for l ∈ [1, 5, 10] and L = 10, sampled every 25 epochs. Test accuracy is at the top. Both attention and feature gradients at the first, middle, and last layer of the network with both balanced initializations are much larger than with unbalanced initialization (note axis scales). To visualize the trainability issue, we study the relative change |(w∗−w0)/w∗|. of trained network parameters (w∗) w.r.t. their initial value. In order to observe meaningful relative change, we only con- sider parameters with a significant contribution to the model output (w∗ ≥ 10−4). We also plot the rel- ative gradient norms of the feature weights across all layers to visualize their propagation. We display these values forL = 5and L = 10in Fig. 3 and 4, respectively, and observe a stark contrast, similar to the trends in relative gradient norms of selected layers of a 10 layer GAT in Fig. 5. In all experiments, GAT was trained with the specified initialization on Cora using GD with γ = 0.1 for 5000 epochs. Interestingly, the attention parameters change most in the first layer and increasingly more towards the last layer, as seen in Fig. 3a and 4a. This is consistently observed in both the 5 and 10 layer networks if the initialization is balanced, but with unbalanced initialization, the 10 layer network is unable to produce the same effect. As our theory defines a coarse-level conservation law, such fine-grained training dynamics cannot be completely explained by it. Since the attention parameters are set to 0 in the balanced initializations (see Procedure 2.6), as ablation, we also observe the effect of initializing attention and feature parameters with zero and Xavier, respectively. From Eq.(2), al = 0leads to αuv = 1/|N(v)|, implying that all neighbors u of the node v are equally important at initialization. Intuitively, this allows the network to learn the importance of neighbors without any initially introduced bias and thus avoids the ‘chicken and egg’ problem that arises in the initialization of attention over nodes[30]. Although this helps generalization in some cases (see Fig. 6), it alone does not help the trainability issue as seen in Fig. 4a. It may in fact worsen it (see Fig. 5), which is explained by Eq. 8. These observations underline the further need for parameter balancing. Procedure 2.6 (Balancing). Based on Eq. (5) from the norm preservation law 2.3, we note that in order to achieve balancedness, (i.e. set c = 0in Eq.(5)), the randomly initialized parameters Wl and al must satisfy the following equality for l ∈ [L]: \r\rWl[i, :] \r\r2 − \r\ral[i] \r\r2 = \r\rWl+1[: i] \r\r2 This can be achieved by scaling the randomly initialized weights as follows: 1. Set al = 0 for l ∈ [L]. 2. Set W1[i, :] = W1[i,:] ∥W1[i,:]∥ √βi, for i ∈ [n1] where βi is a hyperparameter 3. Set Wl+1[:, i] = Wl+1[:,i] ∥Wl+1[:,i]∥ \r\rWl[i, :] \r\r for i ∈ [nl] and l ∈ [L − 1] In step 2, βi determines the initial squared norm of the incoming weights to neuron i in the first layer. It can be any constant thus also randomly sampled from a normal or uniform distribution. We explain why we set βi = 2for i ∈ [n1] in the context of an orthogonal initialization. Remark 2.7. This procedure balances the network starting from l = 1towards l = L. Yet, it could also be carried out in reverse order by first defining \r\rWL[:, i] \r\r2 = βi for i ∈ [nL−1]. Balanced Orthogonal Initialization The feature weights Wl for l ∈ [L] need to be initialized randomly before balancing, which can simply be done by using Xavier initialization. However, existing works have pointed out benefits of orthogonal initialization to achieve initial dynamical 6(a) Test accuracy (higher is better).  (b) Epochs to best model (lower is better). Figure 6: GAT trained on Cora using SGD isometry for DNNs and CNNs [37, 44, 23], as it enables training very deep architectures. In line with these findings, we initialize Wl, before balancing, to be an orthogonal matrix with a looks-linear (LL) mirrored block structure [46, 6], that achieves perfect dynamical isometry in perceptrons with ReLU activation functions. Due to the peculiarity of neighborhood aggregation, the same technique does not induce perfect dynamical isometry in GATs (or GNNs). Exploring how dynamical isometry can be achieved or approximated in general GNNs could be an interesting direction for future work. Nevertheless, using a (balanced) LL-orthogonal initialization enhances trainaibility, particularly of deeper models. We defer further discussion on the effects of orthogonal initialization, such as with identity matrices, to the appendix. We outline the initialization procedure as follows: Let ∥ and |= denote row-wise and column- wise matrix concatenation, respectively. Let us draw a random orthonormal submatrix Ul and define W1 = [U1 ∥ −U1] where U1 ∈ R n1 2 ×n0 , Wl = [[Ul ∥ −Ul] |= [−Ul ∥ Ul]] where Ul ∈ R nl 2 × nl−1 2 for l = {2, . . . , L− 1}, and WL = [UL |= −UL] where UL ∈ RnL× nl−1 2 . Since UL is an orthonormal matrix, \r\rWL[:, i] \r\r2 = 2by definition, and by recursive application of Eq. (2.3 (with al = 0), balancedness requires that \r\rW1[i :, ] \r\r2 = 2. Therefore, we set βi = 2for i ∈ n1. 3 Experiments The main purpose of our experiments is to verify the validity of our theoretical insights and deduce an explanation for a major trainability issue of GATs that is amplified with increased network depth. Based on our theory, we understand the striking observation in Figure 4a that the parameters of default Xavier initialized GATs struggle to change during training. We demonstrate the validity of our theory with the nature of our solution. As we balance the parameter initialization (see Procedure 2.6), we allow the gradient signal to pass through the network layers, which enables parameter changes during training in all GAT layers. In consequence, balanced initialization schemes achieve higher generalization performance and significant training speed ups in comparison with the default Xavier initialization. It also facilitates training deeper GAT models. To analyze this effect systematically, we study the different GAT initializations listed in Table 1 on generalization (in % accuracy) and training speedup (in epochs) using nine common benchmark datasets for semi-supervised node classification tasks. We defer dataset details to the supplement. We use the standard provided train/validation/test splits and have removed the isolated nodes from Citeseer. We use the Pytorch Geometric framework and run our experiments on either Nvidia T4 Tensor Core GPU with 15 GB RAM or Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU with 6 GB RAM. We allow each network to train, both with SGD and Adam, for 5000 epochs (unless it converges earlier, i.e. achieves training loss ≤ 10−4) and select the model state with the highest validation accuracy. For each experiment, the mean ±95% confidence interval over five runs is reported for accuracy and epochs to the best model. All reported results use ReLU activation, weight sharing and no biases, unless stated otherwise. No weight sharing leads to similar trends, which we therefore omit. SGD We first evaluate the performance of the different initialization schemes of GAT models using vanilla gradient descent. Since no results have been previously reported using SGD on these datasets, to the best of our knowledge, we find that setting a learning rate of 0.1, 0.05 and 0.005 for L = [2, 5], L = [10, 20], and L = 40, respectively, allows for reasonably stable training on Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed. For the remaining datasets, we set the learning rate to 0.05, 0.01, 0.005 and 0.0005 for 7Table 2: Mean accuracy(%) ± 95% CI over five runs of GAT with width= 64trained using SGD. Init.

Note that we do not perform fine-tuning of the learning rate or other hyperparameters with respect to performance and use the same settings for all initializations to allow fair comparison. Figure 6 highlights that models initialized with balanced parameters, Bal O, consistently achieve the best accuracy and significantly speed up training, even on shallow models of 2 layers. In line with our theory, the default Xavier (Xav) initialization hampers model training (see also Figure 4a). Interestingly, the default Xavier (Xav) initialized deeper models tend to improve in performance with width but cannot compete with balanced initialization schemes. For example, the accuracy achieved by Xav for L = 10increases from 24.7% to 68.7% when the width is increased from 64 to 512. We hypothesize that the reason why width aids generalization performance is that a higher number of (almost random) features supports better models. This would also be in line with studies of overparameterization in vanilla feed-forward architectures, where higher width also aids random feature models [2, 4, 57, 43]. The observation that width overparameterized models enable training deeper models may be of independent interest in the context of how overparameterization in GNNs may be helpful. However, training wider and deeper (hence overall larger) models is computationally inefficient, even for datasets with the magnitude of Cora. In contrast, the BalO initialized model for L = 10is already able to attain 79.7% even with width= 64and improves to 80.9% with width= 512. Primarily the 8(a) Test accuracy.  (b) Epochs to convergence. Figure 7: GAT with 64 hidden dimensions trained using Adam. parameter balancing must be responsible for the improved performance, as it is not sufficient to simply initialize the attention weights to zero, as shown in Figure 4a and 5. For the remaining datasets, we report only the performance of networks with 64 hidden dimension in Table 2 for brevity. Since we have considered the XavZ initialization only as an ablation study and find it to be ineffective (see Figure 6a), we do not discuss it any further. Note that for some datasets (e.g.Pubmed, Wisconsin), deeper models (e.g. L = 40) are unable to train at all with Xavier initialization, which explains the high variation in test accuracy across multiple runs as, in each run, the model essentially remains a random network. The reduced performance even with balanced initialization at higher depth may be due to a lack of convergence within5000 epochs. Nevertheless, the fact that the drop in performance is not drastic, but rather gradual as depth increases, indicates that the network is being trained, i.e. trainability is not an issue. As a stress test, we validate that GAT networks with balanced initialization maintain their trainability at even larger depths of 64 and 80 layers (see Fig. 9 in appendix). In fact, the improved performance and training speed-up of models with balanced initialization as opposed to models with standard initialization is upheld even more so for very deep networks. Apart from Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed, the other datasets are considered heterophilic in nature and standard GNN models do not perform very well on them. State-of-the-art performance on these datasets is achieved by specialized models. We do not compare with them for two reasons: i) they do not employ an attention mechanism, which is the focus of our investigations, but comprise various special architectural elements and ii) our aim is not to outperform the SOTA, but rather highlight a mechanism that underlies the learning dynamics and can be exploited to improve trainability. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of a balanced initialization in training deep GATs in comparison to LipschitzNorm [14], a normalization technique proposed specifically for training deep GNNs with self-attention layers such as GAT (see Table 6 in appendix). Adam Adam, the most commonly used optimizer for GNNs, stabilizes the training dynamics and can compensate partially for problematic initializations. However, the drop in performance with depth, though smaller, is inevitable with unbalanced initialization. As evident from Figure 7, BalO initialized models achieve higher accuracy than or at par with Xavier initialization and converge in fewer epochs. As we observe with SGD, this difference becomes more prominent with depth, despite the fact that Adam itself significantly improves the trainability of deeper networks over SGD. Our argument of small relative gradients (see Eq.(8)) also applies to Adam. We have used the initial learning rates reported in the literature [9]: 0.005 for Cora and Citeseer, and 0.01 for Pubmed for the 2 and 5 layer networks. To allow stable training of deeper networks, we reduce the initial learning rate by a factor 0.1 for the 10 and 20 layer networks on all three datasets. Architectural variations We also consider other architectural variations such as employing ELUs instead of ReLUs, using multiple attention heads, turning off weight sharing, and addition of standard elements such as weight decay and dropout. In all cases, the results follow a similar tendency as already reported. Due to a lack of space, we defer the exact results to the appendix. These variations further increase the performance of networks with our initialization proposals, which can therefore be regarded as complementary. Note that residual skip connections between layers are also supported 9in a balanced initialization provided their parameters are initialized with zero. However, to isolate the contribution of the initialization scheme and validate our theoretical insights, we have focused our exposition on the vanilla GAT version. Limitations The derived conservation law only applies to the self-attention defined in the original GAT and GATv2 models, and their architectural variations such as ωGAT[18] (see Fig. 10 in appendix). Note that the law also holds for the non-attentive GCNs (see Table 7 in appendix) which are a special case of GATs (where the attention parameters are simply zero). Modeling different kinds of self-attention such as the dot-product self-attention in [28] entails modification of the conservation law, which has been left for future work. 4 Discussion GATs [9] are powerful graph neural network models that form a cornerstone of learning from graph- based data. The dynamic attention mechanism provides them with high functional expressiveness, as they can flexibly assign different importance to neighbors based on their features. However, as we slightly increase the network depth, the attention and feature weights face difficulty changing during training, which prevents us from learning deeper and more complex models. We have derived an explanation of this issue in the form of a structural relationship between the gradients and parameters that are associated with a feature. This relationship implies a conservation law that preserves a sum of the respective squared weight and attention norms during gradient flow. Accordingly, if weight and attention norms are highly unbalanced as is the case in standard GAT initialization schemes, relative gradients for larger parameters do not have sufficient room to increase. This phenomenon is similar in nature to the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime [ 24, 54], where only the last linear layer of a classic feed-forward neural network architecture can adapt to a task. Conservation laws for basic feed-forward architectures [15, 3, 32] do not require an infinite width assumption like NTK-related theory and highlight more nuanced issues for trainability. Furthermore, they are intrinsically linked to implicit regularization effects during gradient descent [41]. Our results are of independent interest also in this context, as we incorporate the attention mechanism into the analysis, which has implications for sequence models and transformers as well. One of these implications is that an unbalanced initialization hampers the trainability of the involved parameters. Yet, the identification of the cause already contains an outline for its solution. Balancing the initial norms of feature and attention weights leads to more effective parameter changes and significantly faster convergence during training, even in shallow architectures. To further increase the trainability of feature weights, we endow them with a balanced orthogonal looks-linear structure, which induces perfect dynamical isometry in perceptrons [10] and thus enables signal to pass even through very deep architectures. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets have verified the validity of our theoretical insights and isolated the effect of different modifications of the initial parameters on the trainability of GATs. 5 Acknowledgements We gratefully acknowledge funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the Horizon Europe Framework Programme (HORIZON) for proposal number 101116395 SPARSE-ML. 10References [1] Uri Alon and Eran Yahav.

Scalar and element-wise products are denoted ⟨, ⟩ and ⊙, respectively. Boldface lowercase and uppercase symbols represent vectors and matrices, respectively. Our proof of Theorem 2.2 utilizes a rescale invariance that follows from Noether’s theorem, as stated by [31]. Note that we could also derive the gradient structure directly from the derivatives, but the rescale invariance is easier to follow. Definition 6.1 (Rescale invariance). The loss L(θ) is rescale invariant with respect to disjoint subsets of the parameters θ1 and θ2 if for every λ >0 we have L(θ) =L((λθ1, λ−1θ2, θd)), where θ = (θ1, θ2, θd). We frequently utilize the following relationship. Lemma 6.2 (Gradient structure due to rescale invariance [31]). The rescale invariance of L enforces the following geometric constraint on the gradients of the loss with respect to its parameters: ⟨θ1, ∇θ1 L⟩ − ⟨θ2, ∇θ2 L⟩ = 0. (10) We first use this rescale invariance to prove our main theorem for a GAT with shared feature transformation weights and a single attention head, as described in Def. 2.1. The underlying principle generalizes to other GAT versions as well, as we exemplify with two other variants. Firstly, we study the case of unshared weights for feature transformation of source and target nodes. Secondly, we discuss multiple attention heads. Proof of Theorem 2.2 Our main proof strategy relies on identifying a multiplicative rescale invariance in GATs that allows us to apply Lemma 6.2. We identify rescale invariances for every neuron i at layer l that induce the stated gradient structure. Specifically, we define the components of in-coming weights to the neuron as θ1 = {w | w ∈ Wl[i, : ]} and the union of all out-going edges (regarding features and attention) as θ2 = {w | w ∈ Wl+1[: , i]} ∪ {al[i]}. It is left to show that these parameters are invariant under rescaling. Let us, therefore, evaluate the GAT loss at λθ1 and λ−1θ2 and show that it remains invariant for any choice of λ >0. Note that the only components of the network that potentially change under rescaling are hl u[i], hl+1 v [j], and αl uv. We denote the scaled network components with a tilde resulting in ˜hl u[i], ˜hl+1 v [k], and ˜αl uv As we show, parameters of upper layers remain unaffected, as ˜hl+1 v [k] coincides with its original non-scaled variant ˜hl+1 v [k] =hl+1 v [k]. Let us start with the attention coefficients. Note that ˜al[i] =λ−1al[i] and ˜Wl[i, j] =λWl[i, j]. This implies that ˜αl uv = exp(el uv)P u′∈N(v) exp(eluv) = αl uv , because (11) ˜el uv = (al)⊤ · ϕ2(Wl(hl−1 u + hl−1 v )) =el uv, (12) which follows from the positive homogeneity of ϕ2 that allows ˜el uv = λ−1al[i]ϕ2( nl−1X j λWl[i, j](hl−1 u [j] +hl−1 v [j]) + nlX i′̸=i al[i]ϕ2( nl−1X j Wl[i, j](hl−1 u [j] +hl−1 v [j]) (13) = λ−1λal[i]ϕ2( nl−1X j Wl[i, j](hl−1 u [j] +hl−1 v [j]) + nlX i′̸=i al[i]ϕ2( nl−1X j Wl[i, j](hl−1 u [j] +hl−1 v [j]) (14) = el uv. (15) 15Since ˜αl uv = αl uv, it follows that ˜hu l [i] =ϕ1   X z∈N(u) αl zu nl−1X j λWl[i, j]hl−1 z [j]   = λϕ1   X z∈N(u) αl zu nl−1X j Wl[i, j]hl−1 z [j]   = λhl u[i] In the next layer, we therefore have ˜hl+1 v [k] =ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i λ−1Wl+1[k, i]˜hl u[i]   = ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i λ−1Wl+1[k, i]λhl u[i]   = ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i Wl+1[k, i]hl u[i]   = hl+1 v [k] Thus, the output node representations of the network remain unchanged, and according to Def. 6.1, the loss L is rescale-invariant. Consequently, as per Lemma 6.2, the constraint in Eq.(10) can be written as: ⟨Wl[i, :], ∇Wl[i,:]L⟩ − ⟨al[i], ∇al[i]L⟩ − ⟨Wl+1[:, i], ∇Wl+1[:,i]L⟩ = 0. which can be rearranged to Eq.((2.2): ⟨Wl[i, :], ∇Wl[i,:]L⟩ − ⟨al[i], ∇al[i]L⟩ = ⟨Wl+1[:, i], ∇Wl+1[:,i]L⟩. thus proving Theorem 2.2. Proof of Corollary 2.3 Given that gradient flow applied on loss L is captured by the differential equation dw dt = −∇wL (16) which implies: d dt \r\rWl[i, :] \r\r2 = 2⟨Wl[i, :], d dtWl[i, :]⟩ = −2⟨Wl[i, :], ∇Wl[i,:]L⟩ (17) substituting in Eq.(4) similarly for gradient flow of Wl+1[:, i] and al[i], as done in Eq.(17) yields Theorem 2.2: d dt \u0010\r\rWl[i, :] \r\r2 − \r\ral[i] \r\r2\u0011 = d dt \u0010\r\rWl+1[: i] \r\r2\u0011 . −2⟨Wl[i, :], ∇Wl[i,:]L⟩ −(−2)⟨al[i], ∇al[i]L⟩ = −2⟨Wl+1[:, i], ∇Wl+1[:,i]L⟩. Therefore, Eq.(4) and consequently Eq.(5) in Corollary 2.3 hold. Summing over i ∈ [nl] on both sides of Eq.(4) yields Corollary 2.4. 16Theorem 6.3 (Structure of gradients for GAT without weight-sharing). Let a GAT network as defined by Def. 2.1 consisting of L layers be given. The feature transformation parameters Wl s and Wl t of the source and target nodes of an edge and attention parametersal of a GAT layer l are defined according to Eq.(1) and (2). Then the gradients for layer l ∈ [L − 1] in the network are governed by the following law: ⟨Wl s[i, :], ∇Wls[i,:]L⟩ + ⟨Wl t [i, :], ∇Wl t [i,:]L⟩ − ⟨al[i], ∇al[i]L⟩ = ⟨Wl+1 s [:, i], ∇Wl+1 s [:,i]L⟩ (18) Proof. The proof is analogous to the derivation of Theorem 2.2. We follow the same principles and define the disjoint subsets θ1 and θ2 of the parameter set θ, associated with a neuron i in layer l accordingly, as follows: θ1 = {w|w ∈ Wl s[i, :]} ∪ {w|w ∈ Wl t [i, :]} θ2 = {w|w ∈ Wl+1 s [:, i]} ∪ {al[i]} Then, the invariance of node representations follows similarly to the proof of Theorem 2.2. The only components of the network that potentially change under rescaling are hl u[i], hl+1 v [j], and αl uv. We denote the scaled network components with a tilde resulting in ˜hl u[i], ˜hl+1 v [k], and ˜αl uv As we show, parameters of upper layers remain unaffected, as ˜hl+1 v [k] coincides with its original non-scaled variant ˜hl+1 v [k] =hl+1 v [k]. Let us start with the attention coefficients. Note that ˜al[i] =λ−1al[i], ˜Ws l [i, j] = λWl s[i, j] and ˜Wl t [i, j] =λWl t [i, j]. This implies that ˜αl uv = exp(el uv)P u′∈N(v) exp(eluv) = αl uv , because (19) ˜el uv = (al)⊤ · ϕ2(Wl shl−1 u + Wl t hl−1 v ) =el uv, (20) which follows from the positive homogeneity of ϕ2 that allows ˜el uv = λ−1al[i]ϕ2( nl−1X j λWl s[i, j]hl−1 u [j] +λWl t [i, j]hl−1 v [j] (21) + nlX i′̸=i al[i]ϕ2( nl−1X j Wl s[i, j]hl−1 u [j] +Wl t [i, j]hl−1 v [j]) (22) = λ−1λal[i]ϕ2( nl−1X j Wl s[i, j]hl−1 u [j] +Wl t [i, j]hl−1 v [j] (23) + nlX i′̸=i al[i]ϕ2( nl−1X j Wl s[i, j]hl−1 u [j] +Wl t [i, j]hl−1 v [j]) (24) = el uv. (25) Since ˜αl uv = αl uv, it follows that ˜hu l [i] =ϕ1   X z∈N(u) αl zu nl−1X j λWl s[i, j]hl−1 z [j]   = λϕ1   X z∈N(u) αl zu nl−1X j Wl s[i, j]hl−1 z [j]   = λhl u[i] 17In the next layer, we therefore have ˜hv l+1 [k] =ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i λ−1Wl+1 s [k, i]˜hl u[i]   = ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i λ−1Wl+1 s [k, i]λhl u[i]   = ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i Wl+1 s [k, i]hl u[i]   = hl+1 v [k] Thus, the application of Lemma 6.2 derives Theorem 6.3. Theorem 6.4 (Structure of gradients for GAT with multi-headed attention) . Given the feature transformation parameters Wl k and attention parameters al k of an attention head k ∈ [K] in a GAT layer of a L layer network. Then the gradients of layer l ∈ [L − 1] respect the law: KX k ⟨Wl k[i, :], ∇Wl k[i,:]L⟩ − KX k ⟨al k[i], ∇al k[i]L⟩ = KX k ⟨Wl+1 k [:, i], ∇Wl+1 k [:,i]L⟩. (26) Proof. Each attention head is independently defined by Eq.1 and Eq.2, and thus Theorem 2.2 holds for each head, separately. The aggregation of multiple heads in a layer is done over node representations of each head in either one of two ways: Concatenation: hl v =∥K k ϕ(P u∈N(v) αkuv l · Wl khl−1 u ) , or Average: hl v = 1 K PK k ϕ(P u∈N(v) αkuv l · Wl khl−1 u ) Thus, the rescale invariance and consequent structure of gradients of the parameters in each head are not altered and Eq.(6.2) holds by summation of the conservation law over all heads. For the most general case of a GAT layer without weight-sharing and with multi-headed attention, each term in Theorem 6.3 is summed over all heads. Further implications analogous to Corollary 2.3, and 2.4 can be derived for these variants by similar principles. 7 Training Dynamics In the main paper, we have shared observations regarding the learning dynamics of GAT networks of varying depths with standard initialization and or balanced initialization schemes. Here, we report additional figures for more varied depths to complete the picture. All figures in this section correspond to a L layer GAT network trained on Cora. For SGD, the learning rate is set to γ = 0.1, γ = 0.05 and γ = 0.01 for L = 5, L = 10and L = 20, respectively. For Adam, γ = 0.005 and γ = 0.0001 for L = 5and L = 10, respectively. Relative change of a feature transformation parameter w is defined as |(w∗−w0)/w∗| where w0 is the initialized value and w∗ is the value for the model with maximum validation accuracy during training. Absolute change |a∗ − a0| is used for attention parameters a since attention parameters are initialized with 0 in the balanced initialization. We view the fraction of parameters that remain unchanged during training separately in Figure 8, and examine the layer-wise distribution of change in parameters in Figure 11 without considering the unchanged parameters. To analyze how gradients vary in the network during training, we define the relative gradient norm of feature transformation and attention parameters for a layer l as ∥∇WlWl∥F/∥Wl∥F and ∥∇alal∥/∥al∥, respectively. Figures 3b and 4b, and Figure 12 depict relative gradient norms for training under SGD and Adam respectively. 18(a) L = 5  (b) L = 10  (c) L = 20 Figure 8: Layer-wise fraction of feature transformation parameters Wl and attention parameters al with zero relative and absolute change, respectively, trained with SGD. For L = 2, no parameters with zero change existed. A small number of feature weights do not change in a 5 layer unbalanced network initialized with Xavier, but this fraction becomes significantly large when depth is increased to L = 10. Note that W1 contains a much larger number of parameters compared to the intermediate layers (specifically in this case, though it is generally common). At L = 20, nearly all w ∈ Wl with an unbalanced initialization (Xav. and Xav+ZeroAtt) struggle to change during training, whereas the balanced Xavier and LL-orthogonal initialization are able to drive change in most w ∈ Wl and all a ∈ al parameters, allowing the network to train. 8 Additional Results The results of the main paper have focused on the vanilla GAT having ReLU activation between consecutive layers, a single attention head, and shared weights for feature transformation of the source and target nodes, optimized with vanilla gradient descent (or Adam) without any regularization. Here, we present additional results for training with architectural variations, comparing a balanced initialization with a normalization scheme focused on GATs, and discussing the impact of an orthogonal initialization and the applicability of the derived conservation law to other message- passing GNNs (MPGNNs). Training variations To understand the impact of different architectural variations, common regular- ization strategies such as dropout and weight decay, and different activation functions, we conducted additional experiments. For a 10-layer network with width 64, Table 3 and 4 report our results for SGD and Adam, respectively. The values of hyperparameters were taken from [48].

Dropout generally does not seem to be helpful to the deeper network ( L = 10), regardless of the initialization. From Table 3 and 4, it is evident that although techniques like dropout and weight decay may aid optimization, they are 19Table 4: Mean test accuracy(%) ± 95% CI over five runs of GAT trained on Cora using Adam Variation L Xav Bal X BalO None (Vanilla GAT) 5 76 .18 ± 1.61 79 .38 ± 2.24 80.20 ± 0.57 10 70 .86 ± 3.99 75 .72 ± 2.35 79.62 ± 1.27 attention heads = 8 5 75 .62 ± 1.74 78 .54 ± 1.06 79.56 ± 0.85 10 70 .94 ± 2.76 75 .48 ± 2.48 79.74 ± 1.10 activation = ELU 5 76 .56 ± 1.72 78 .72 ± 1.02 79.56 ± 0.64 10 75 .30 ± 1.42 78.48 ± 1.79 76.52 ± 0.97 dropout = 0.6 5 76 .74 ± 1.44 78 .42 ± 1.28 79.92 ± 0.48 10 32 .48 ± 6.99 31 .76 ± 1.33 76.34 ± 0.95 weight decay = 0.0005 5 75 .10 ± 2.05 78 .52 ± 1.41 79.80 ± 0.63 10 28 .74 ± 12.04 74 .68 ± 3.06 79.70 ± 1.14 weight sharing = False 5 76 .56 ± 1.72 78 .72 ± 1.02 79.56 ± 0.64 10 71 .12 ± 2.23 73 .32 ± 1.23 79.46 ± 1.16 alone not enough to enable the trainability of deeper network GATs and thus are complementary to balancedness. Note that ELU is not a positively homogeneous activation function, which is an assumption in out theory. In practice, however, it does not impact the Xavier-balanced initialization (Bal X). However, the Looks-Linear orthogonal structure is specific to ReLUs. Therefore, the orthogonality and balancedness of the Bal O initialization are negatively impacted by ELU, although the Adam optimizer seems to compensate for it to some extent. In addition to increasing the trainability of deeper networks, the balanced initialization matches the state-of-the-art performance of Xavier initialized 2 layer GAT, given the architecture and optimization hyperparameters as reported in [48]. We used an existing GAT implementation and training script2 of Cora that follows the original GAT(v1)[48] paper and added our balanced initialization to the code. As evident from Table 5, the balanced initialization matches SOTA performance of GAT(v1) on Cora (83-84%) (on a version of the dataset with duplicate edges). GAT(v2) achieved 78.5% accuracy on Pubmed but the corresponding hyperparameter values were not reported. Hence, we transferred them from [48]. This way, we are able to match the state-of-the-art performance of GAT(v2) on Pubmed, as shown in Table 5.

We use their provided code to reproduce their experiments on Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed for 2,5,10,20 and 40-layer GATs with Lipschitz normalization and compare them with LLortho+Bal initialization in Table 6. Note that Lipschitz normalization has been shown to outperform other previous normalization techniques for GNNs such as pair-norm [64] and layer-norm [5]. Impact of orthogonal initialization In the main paper, we have advocated and presented results for using a balanced LL-orthogonal initialization. Here, we discuss two special cases of orthogonal initialization (and their balanced versions): identity matrices that have also been used for GNNs in 2https://github.com/Diego999/pyGAT 20Table 6: Comparing a balanced LL-orthogonal initialization to Lipschitz normalization applied with a standard (imbalanced) Xavier initialization: the balanced initialization results in a much higher accuracy as the depth of the network increases.

In line with [18], identity and LLidentity are used to initialize the hidden layers while Xavier is used to initialize the first and last layers. A network initialized with identity is balanced by adjusting the weights of the first and last layer to have norm1 (as identity matrices have row-wise and column-wise norm). A network with LLidentity initialization is balanced to have norm 2 in the first and last layer, similar to LLortho initialization. We compare the performance using these four base initializations (one standard Xavier, and three orthogonal cases) and their balanced counterparts in Fig. 9. We observe that balancing an (LL-)orthogonal initialization results in an improvement in the general- ization ability of the network in most cases and speeds up training, particularly for deeper networks. However, note that an (LL-)orthogonal initialization itself also has a positive effect on trainability in particular of deep networks. Contributing to this fact is the mostly-balanced nature of an (LL- )orthogonal initialization i.e. given hidden layers of equal dimensions the network is balanced in all layers except the first and last layers (assuming zero attention parameters), which allows the model to train, as opposed to the more severely imbalanced standard Xavier initialization. This further enforces the key takeaway of our work that norm imbalance at initialization hampers the trainability of GATs. In addition, the LLortho+Bal initialization also speeds up training over the LLortho initialization even in cases in which the generalization performance of the model is at par for both initializations. Figure 9: GAT network with varying initialization trained using SGD. Note that identity initializations have also been explored in the context of standard feed-forward neural networks. While they tend to work in practice, the lack of induced feature diversity can be problematic from a theoretical point of view (see e.g. for a counter-example [7]). However, potentially due to the reasons regarding feature diversity and ReLU activation discussed above, the balanced looks-linear random orthogonal initialization (LLortho+Bal.) outperforms initialization with identity matrices (see Fig. 9). In most cases, the balanced versions outperform the imbalanced version of the base initialization and the performance gap becomes exceedingly large as network depth increases. 21Applicability to other MPGNNs As GAT is a generalization of the GCN, all theorems are also applicable to GCNs (where the attention parameters are simply0). We provide additional experiments in Table 7, comparing the performance of GCN models of varying depths with imbalanced and balanced initializations trained on Cora using the SGD optimizer. We use the same hyperparameters as reported for GAT. As expected, the trainability benefits of a balanced initialization are also evident in deeper GCN networks.

However, adapting the balanced initialization to different methods entails modification of the conservation law derived for GATs to correspond to the specific architecture of the other method. For example, the proposed balanced initialization can be applied directly to a more recent variant of GAT, ωGAT [18], for which the same conservation law holds and also benefits from a balanced initialization. We conduct additional experiments to verify this. The results in Fig. 10 follow a similar pattern as for GATs: a balanced orthogonal initialization with looks linear structure (LLortho+Bal) of ωGAT performs the best, particularly by a wide margin at much higher depths (64 and 80 layers). Figure 10: ωGAT network with varying trained on Cora. In this work, we focus our exposition on GATs and take the first step in modeling the training dynamics of attention-based models for graph learning. An intriguing direction for future work is to derive modifications in the conservation law for other attention-based models utilizing the dot-product self-attention mechanism such as SuperGAT [28] and other architectures based on Transformers[47], 22that are widely used in Large Language Models (LLMs) and have recently also been adapted for graph learning [58, 60]. 9 Datasets Summary We used nine benchmark datasets for the transductive node classification task in our experiments, as summarized in Table 8. For the Platenoid datasets (Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed) [56], we use the graphs provided by Pytorch Geometric (PyG), in which each link is saved as an undirected edge in both directions. However, the number of edges is not exactly double (for example, 5429 edges are reported in the raw Cora dataset, but the PyG dataset has 10556 < (2 × 5429)) edges as duplicate edges have been removed in preprocessing. We also remove isolated nodes in the Citeseer dataset. The WebKB (Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin), Wikipedia (Squirrel and Chameleon) and Actor datasets [39], are used from the replication package provided by [40], where duplicate edges are removed. All results in this paper are according to the dataset statistics reported in Table 8. Table 8: Summary of datasets used in experiments. Dataset Cora Cite. Pubmed Cham. Squi. Actor Corn.

The change distribution for the parameters in al is missing for l = 5and l ∈ [7, 10] because these parameters remain unchanged (see Fig.8). (b) L = 20: The same pattern as in L = 10is seen. However, the difference between the trainability of models with unbalanced and balanced initialization becomes even more prominent. No attention parameters change at all with standard Xavier initialization (and hence their change distribution is not visible in the plot). Figure 11: Distributions of the relative and absolute change in the values of feature transformation parameters Wl and attention parameters al, respectively, when trained using SGD with unbalanced (Xav. and Xav+ZeroAtt) and balanced (Xav+Bal and LLortho+Bal) initialization. The black markers in each standard box-whisker plot denote the mean. In general, larger changes occur in attention parameters at later layers closer to the output of the network, whereas feature parameters change more in the earlier layers at the input of the network. We observe this also from the perspective of relative gradients, as higher gradients cause higher parameter changes. 24(a) L = 5: test accuracy (left to right) is 71.6%, 76.2%, 77.3%, and 80.5%. (b) L = 10: test accuracy (left to right) is 63.2%, 68.8%, 71.8%, and 78.0%. Figure 12: Layer-wise relative gradient norms of GAT parameters trained with Adam, which in itself improves trainability over SGD, especially for L = 10(see Fig.4b) even with standard initialization. However, with a balanced initialization, the training is faster and the model also generalizes better, as evident from the significant margin in test accuracy. A general noticeable trend, particularly with balanced initialization, is that the attention parameters have higher gradients at the end of the network (and thus change more in the later layers (see Fig. 11)) whereas the feature parameters have high gradients at the start of the network. Also, it can be seen that the feature parameters begin to change a few epochs before the attention parameters change noticeably, while the attention parameters continue to change for a few more epochs after the gradients of feature parameters have dropped. We speculate a representational benefit could drive this behaviour, i.e. with depth, the learned representation of neighbors becomes increasingly informative for a node and thus leads to a higher activity of the attention mechanism. 25",

        "main_contributions": "The research identifies and addresses a fundamental issue in Graph Attention Networks (GATs): the poor trainability of deeper networks, where a high portion of parameters with standard initialization struggle to change during training. The main contributions include deriving a conservation law of GAT gradient flow dynamics, which explains this lack of trainability, particularly in deeper GATs. Based on this insight, the authors propose a novel balanced initialization scheme that significantly improves gradient propagation, enabling the effective training of deeper GATs and achieving considerable speedups in training and convergence time. This work also serves as a foundational step for studying the learning dynamics of positive homogeneous models with attention mechanisms.",
        "methodology": "The core methodology involves a theoretical derivation of a conservation law for GAT gradient flow dynamics. This law is established using a rescale invariance principle, applied to GATs with positive homogeneous activation functions (like ReLU and LeakyReLU) and shared feature weights. The conservation law mathematically links the l2-norms of incoming feature weights, attention weights, and outgoing feature weights at each neuron, defining a 'degree of balancedness' (c). An initialization is deemed balanced if c=0. To achieve this, a balancing procedure is introduced: it initializes attention parameters to zero and scales feature weights across layers to ensure the norm conservation property holds. A specific 'Balanced Orthogonal Initialization' (BalO) is proposed, which combines this balancing procedure with a Looks-Linear-Orthogonal (LLortho) structure for feature weights, known for inducing dynamical isometry in other neural network types.",
        "experimental_setup": "Experiments were conducted on nine benchmark datasets for semi-supervised node classification: Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, Cornell, Texas, Wisconsin, Squirrel, Chameleon, and Actor. Standard train/validation/test splits were used, with minor preprocessing like removing isolated nodes. The GAT models were implemented using the Pytorch Geometric framework and trained on Nvidia T4 or RTX 3060 GPUs. Both SGD and Adam optimizers were employed, running for up to 5000 epochs with specific learning rates tuned per dataset and depth, without hyperparameter fine-tuning to ensure fair comparison. Models used ReLU activation, weight sharing, and no biases (unless specified for variations). Performance was evaluated by mean test accuracy (%) and epochs to the best model, averaged over five runs with 95% confidence intervals. The study compared four initialization schemes (Xavier, Xavier with Zero Attention, Balanced Xavier, Balanced LL-Orthogonal) and included ablation studies on architectural variations (e.g., multiple attention heads, ELU, dropout, weight decay, no weight sharing), as well as stress tests for very deep networks (up to 80 layers). Comparisons were also made against Lipschitz Normalization and applicability to GCNs and ωGAT was verified.",
        "limitations": "The derived conservation law is specifically applicable to the self-attention mechanisms in the original GAT and GATv2 models, and close architectural variations like ωGAT. It does not directly apply to different types of self-attention, such as dot-product self-attention in models like SuperGAT or Transformers, which would require modification of the law. The theoretical assumption of positive homogeneous activation functions means that non-homogeneous functions like ELU can negatively impact the effectiveness of the balanced orthogonal initialization, although Adam optimizer can partially compensate. The study also notes that while orthogonal initialization generally helps, simple versions like identity matrices may lack induced feature diversity, which can be problematic theoretically. Furthermore, training wider and deeper models, while sometimes improving performance with unbalanced initialization, is computationally inefficient.",
        "future_research_directions": "Future research directions include exploring methods to achieve or approximate dynamical isometry in general Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). A significant area for extension involves deriving modifications to the conservation law for other attention-based models, particularly those using dot-product self-attention mechanisms, such as SuperGAT and Transformer-based architectures used in Large Language Models (LLMs) and graph learning (e.g., graph Transformers, vision Transformers). The authors also suggest further investigating the observation that width-overparameterized models can enable the training of deeper models, which could offer insights into the role of overparameterization in GNNs.",

Introduction Graph neural networks (GNNs) (Gori et al., 2005) are a standard class of models for machine learning on graph- structured data that utilize node feature and graph struc- ture information jointly to achieve strong empirical per- formance, particularly on node classification tasks. In- put graphs to GNNs stem from various domains of real- world systems such as social (Bian et al., 2020), com- mercial (Zhang & Chen, 2020), academic (Hamaguchi et al., 2017), economic (Monken et al., 2021), biochem- ical(Kearnes et al., 2016), physical (Shlomi et al., 2021), and transport (Wu et al., 2019) networks that are diverse in their node feature and graph structure properties. 1CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, 66123 Saarbr¨ucken, Germany. Correspondence to: Nimrah Mustafa <nimrah.mustafa@cispa.de>. Proceedings of the 41 st International Conference on Machine Learning, Vienna, Austria. PMLR 235, 2024. Copyright 2024 by the author(s). The message-passing mechanism of GNNs (Kipf & Welling, 2017; Xu et al., 2019) involves two key steps: a transformation of the node features, and the aggregation of these transformed features from a node’s neighborhood to update the node’s representation during training. While this has proven to be largely successful in certain cases, it gen- erally introduces some problems for learning with GNNs, the most notorious of which is over-smoothing (Li et al., 2018). The enforced use of structural information in ad- dition to node features may be detrimental to learning the node classification task, as shown by recent results where state-of-the-art GNNs perform the same as or worse than multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) (Gomes et al., 2022; Yan et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2022). One such task is where node labels can be easily determined by informative node fea- tures and require no contribution from the neighborhood. Here, standard neighborhood aggregation, as in most GNN architectures, would impair model performance, particu- larly with an increase in model depth. A popular standard GNN architecture that, in principle, tries to resolve this problem is the Graph Attention Net- work (GAT) (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2018; Brody et al., 2022). By design, neighborhood aggregation in GATs is charac- terized by learnable coefficients intended to assign larger weights to more important neighboring nodes (including the node itself) in order to learn better node representations. Therefore, in the above example, GATs should ideally re- sort to assigning near-zero importance to neighbor nodes, effectively switching off neighborhood aggregation. How- ever, we find that, counter-intuitively, GATs are unable to do this in practice and continue to aggregate the uninforma- tive features in the neighborhood which impedes learning. One may ask why one would employ a GAT (or any GNN architecture) if an MLP suffices. In practice, we do not know whether neighborhood aggregation (of raw features or features transformed by a perceptron or MLP), would be beneficial or not beforehand. This raises a pertinent ques- tion for the GNN research community: How much neigh- borhood aggregation is needed for a given task? . Ideally, it is what we would want a model to learn. Otherwise, the right task-specific architecture would need to be identified by time and resource-intensive manual tuning. We address the challenge faced by GAT to effectively de- 1 arXiv:2406.00418v2  [cs.LG]  29 Jul 2024GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors termine how well a node is represented by its own features compared to the features of neighboring nodes, i.e., dis- tinguish between the relative importance of available node features and graph structure information for a given task. Firstly, we provide an intuitive explanation for the problem based on a conservation law of GAT gradient flow dynam- ics derived by Mustafa & Burkholz (2023). Building on this insight, we present GATE, an extension of the GAT architecture that can switch neighborhood aggregation on and off as necessary. This allows our proposed architecture to gain the following advantages over GAT: 1. It alleviates the notorious over-smoothing problem by addressing the root cause of unnecessarily repeated neighborhood aggregation. 2. It allows the model to benefit from more meaningful representations obtained solely by deeper non-linear transformations, similarly to perceptrons, in layers with little to no neighborhood aggregation. 3. It often outperforms GATs on real-world heterophilic datasets by weighing down unrelated neighbors. 4. It offers interpretable learned self-attention coeffi- cients, at the node level, that are indicative of the rel- ative importance of feature and structure information in the locality of the node. In order to validate these claims, we construct a syn- thetic test bed of two opposite types of learning problems for node classification where label-relevant information is completely present only in a node’s i) own features and ii) neighboring nodes’ features (see Fig. 2). GATE is able to adapt to both cases as necessary. On real-world datasets, GATE performs competitively on homophilic datasets and is substantially better than GAT on heterophilic datasets. Furthermore, up to our knowledge, it achieves a new state of the art on the relatively large OGB-arxiv dataset (Hu et al., 2021) (i.e., 79.57 ± 0.84% test accuracy). In sum- mary, our contributions are as follows: • We identify and experimentally demonstrate a struc- tural limitation of GAT, i.e., its inability to switch off neighborhood aggregation. • We propose GATE, an extension of GAT, that over- comes this limitation and, in doing so, unlocks several benefits of the architecture. • We update an existing conservation law relating the structure of gradients in GAT to GATE. • We construct a synthetic test bed to validate our claims, which could be of independent interest to mea- sure progress in developing adaptive neighborhood aggregation schemes. Figure 1: MLP only performs node feature transforma- tions, whereas GAT also always aggregates over the neigh- borhood. With the ability to switch off neighborhood ag- gregation, GATE can learn to emulate MLP behavior and potentially interleave effective perceptron and standard lay- ers in a flexible manner. This allows for more expressive power that we find to benefit real-world tasks (see Table 3). 2. Related Work To relieve GNNs from the drawbacks of unnecessarily re- peated neighborhood aggregation in deeper models, ini- tial techniques were inspired by classical deep learning of MLPs such as normalization (Cai et al., 2021; Zhao & Akoglu, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; 2021) and regularization (Papp et al., 2021; Rong et al., 2020; Yang et al., 202; Zou et al., 2019). More recently, the need for deeper models and architectural changes to limit neighborhood aggregation as necessary has been recognized. Some approaches use linear combi- nations of initial features and current layer representation (Gasteiger et al., 2019), add skip connections and identity mapping (Chen et al., 2020; Cong et al., 2021), combine representations of all previous layers at the last layer (Xu et al., 2018), aggregate information from a node-wise de- fined range of k-hop neighbors(Liu et al., 2020), and limit the number of aggregation iterations based on node influ- ence scores (Zhang et al., 2021). However, these architec- tures are not flexible enough to utilize additional network layers to simulate perceptron behavior, which, as we find, benefits heterophilic tasks. (Ma et al., 2023) discuss ‘good’ and ‘bad’ heterophily, which are also task-dependent. Other contemporary works for general GNNs propose the use of bilevel optimization to determine a node’s strategic discrete action to a received message (Finkelshtein et al., 2023) and a variational inference framework for adaptive message passing (Errica et al., 2023). While these non- attentive architectures improve message passing in GNNs, we focus on identifying and explaining a structural limita- tion of self-attention in GAT, that continues to be used as a strong baseline architecture. An orthogonal line of research uses graph structural learn- ing (Yang et al., 2019; Stretcu et al., 2019; Franceschi et al., 2020) to amend the input graph structure such that neighborhood aggregation benefits the given task. Such 2GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors approaches are difficult to scale, more susceptible to over- smoothing, and potentially destroy any inherent informa- tion in the original graph structure. On the contrary, a standard GNN architecture equipped to selectively per- form neighborhood aggregation avoids these pitfalls. Self- supervision of the attention mechanism has also been pro- posed (Wang et al., 2019; Kim & Oh, 2021). Methods such as graph rewiring (Deac et al., 2022) to overcome problems such as over-squashing (Alon & Yahav, 2021) are comple- mentary and may also be combined with GATE. While we focus our insights on GAT, architectures based on GAT such as ωGAT (Eliasof et al., 2023) also suffer from the same problem (see Fig. 14 in Appendix C). This further confirms that the universal problem with GAT has been correctly identified. In general, recent works direct ef- fort to understand the current limitations of graph attention (Lee et al., 2023; Fountoulakis et al., 2023). 3. Architecture Notation Consider a graph G = ( V, E) with node set V and edge set E ⊆ V × V, where for a node v ∈ V the neighborhood is N(v) = {u|(u, v) ∈ E} and input features are h0 v. A GNN layer updates each node’s repre- sentation by aggregating over its neighbors’ representation and combining it with its own features. The aggregation and combination steps can be performed together by in- troducing self-loops in G such that, ∀v ∈ V, (v, v) ∈ E. We assume the presence of self-loops in G unless spec- ified otherwise. In GATs, this aggregation is weighted by parameterized attention coefficients αuv, which indi- cate the importance of node u for v. A network is con- structed by stacking L layers, defined as follows, using a non-linear activation function ϕ that is homogeneous (i.e ϕ(x) = xϕ′(x)) and consequently, ϕ(ax) = aϕ(x) for positive scalars a) such as ReLU ϕ(x) = max {x, 0} or LeakyReLU ϕ(x) = max{x, 0} + −α max{−x, 0}. GAT Given input representations hl−1 v for v ∈ V, a GAT 1 layer l ∈ [L] transforms those to: hl v = ϕ   X u∈N(v) αl uv · Wl shl−1 u  , where (1) αl uv = exp \u0000 el uv \u0001 P u′∈N(v) exp \u0000 el u′v \u0001, and (2) el uv = \u0000 al\u0001⊤ · ϕ \u0000 Wl shl−1 u + Wl thl−1 v \u0001 (3) The feature transformation weights Ws and Wt for source and target nodes, respectively, may also be shared such that Ws = Wt. We denote this variant of GAT by GATS. 1Throughout, we refer to GATv2 (Brody et al., 2022) as GAT. GATE In addition, we propose GATE, a GAT variant that flexibly weights the importance of node features and neigh- borhood features. A GATE layer is also defined by Eq. (1) and (2) but modifies euv in Eq. (3) to Eq. (4). el uv = \u0000 1u̸=val s + 1u=val t \u0001⊤ ·ϕ \u0000 Ulhl−1 u + Vlhl−1 v \u0001 . (4) We denote euv in Eq. (3) and (4) as el vv if u = v. For GATE, Wl s in Eq. (1) is denoted as Wl. A weight- sharing variant of GATE, GATE S, is characterized by all feature transformation parameters being shared in a layer (i.e. Wl = Ul = Vl). Note that, then, for a d-dimensional layer, GATE adds onlyd more parameters to GAT. We next present theoretical insights into the reasoning be- hind the inability of GATs to switch off neighborhood ag- gregation, which is rooted in norm constraints imposed by the inherent conservation law for GATs. The gradients of GATE fulfill an updated conservation law (Thoerem 4.3) that enables switching off neighborhood aggregation in a parameter regime with well-trainable attention. 4. Theoretical Insights For simplicity, we limit our discussion here to GATs with weight sharing. We derive similar arguments for GATs without weight sharing in Appendix A.1. The following conservation law was recently derived for GATs to explain trainability issues of standard initialization schemes. Even with improved initializations, we argue that this law lim- its the effective expressiveness of GATs and their ability to switch off neighborhood aggregation when necessary. Theorem 4.1 (Thm. 2.2 by Mustafa & Burkholz (2023)) . The parameters θ of a layer l ∈ [L − 1] in a GAT network and their gradients ∇θL w.r.t. loss L fulfill: ⟨Wl [i,:], ∇Wl [i,:] ⟩ = ⟨Wl+1 [:,i] , ∇Wl+1 [:,i] ⟩ + ⟨al [i], ∇al [i] ⟩. (5) Intuitively, this equality limits the budget for the relative change of parameters and imposes indirectly a norm con- straint on the parameters. Under gradient flow that assumes infinitesimally small learning rates, this law implies that the relationship \r\rWl[i, :] \r\r2 − \r\ral[i] \r\r2 − \r\rWl+1[: i] \r\r2 = c stays constant during training, where c is defined by the initial norms. Other gradient-based optimizers fulfill this norm balance also approximately. Note that the norms\r\rWl[i, :] \r\r generally do not assume arbitrary values but are determined by the required scale of the output. Deeper models are especially less flexible in varying these norms as deviations could lead to exploding or diminishing out- puts and/or gradients. In consequence, the norms of the attention parameters are also bounded. Furthermore, a pa- rameter becomes harder to change during training when its 3GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors magnitude increases. This can be seen by transforming the law with respect to the relative change of a parameter de- fined as ∆θ = ∇θL/θ for θ ̸= 0 or ∆θ = 0 for θ = 0. nl+1X j=1 Wl ij 2 ∆Wl ij = nl+2X k=1 Wl+1 ki 2 ∆Wl+1 ki + al i 2 ∆al i. (6) The higher the magnitude of an attention parameter (al i)2, the smaller will be the relative change ∆al i and vice versa. This restricts the attention mechanism in the network to a less-trainable regime without converging to a meaningful model. We next explain why large \r\ral\r\r are required to switch off neighborhood aggregation in a layer. Insight 4.2 (Effective expressiveness of GATs). GATs are challenged to switch off neighborhood aggregation during training, as this requires the model to enter a less trainable regime with large attention parameters ∥a∥2 >> 1. An intuitive derivation of this insight is presented in the appendix. Here, we outline the main argument based on the observation that to make the contribution of neighbor j insignificant relative to node i, we require αij/αii << 1. We use relativeαij/αii instead of αij and αii to cancel out normalization constants and simplify the analysis. Our key observation is that, given an insignificant link (i, j), its relative contribution to its two neighborhoods αij/αii << 1 and αji/αjj << 1 are affected in oppo- site ways by a feature f of the attention parameters a, i.e. if a[f] contributes to reducing αij/αii, it automatically in- creases αji/αjj . However, we require multiple features that contribute to reducing only αij without strengthen- ing αji that may only be possible in a high dimensional space requiring large norms of a. Yet, the norms ∥a∥2 are constrained by the parameter initialization and cannot in- crease arbitrarily due to the derived conservation law. Note that to switch off all neighborhood aggregation, we require αij/αii << 1, ∀ j ∈ N(i), further complicating the task. To address this challenge, we modify the GAT architecture by GATE that learns separate attention parameters for the node and the neighborhood contribution. As its conserva- tion law indicates, it can switch off neighborhood aggrega- tion in the well-trainable parameter regime. Theorem 4.3 (Structure of GATE gradients). The param- eters and gradients of a GATE network w.r.t. to loss L for layer l ∈ [L − 1] are conserved according to the following laws. Given Θ(θ) = ⟨θ, ∇θL⟩, it holds that: Θ(Wl [i,:]) − Θ(al+1 s [i]) − Θ(al+1 t [i]) = Θ(Wl+1 [:,i] ). (7) and, if additional independent matrices Ul and Vl are trainable, it also holds that: Θ(al s[i]) + Θ(al t[i]) = Θ(Ul [i,:]) + Θ(Vl [i,:]). (8) The proof is provided in the appendix. We utilize this the- orem for two purposes. Firstly, it induces an initialization that enables at least the initial trainability of the network. Similarly to GAT (Mustafa & Burkholz, 2023), we initial- ize all a parameters with zero and matrices W with ran- dom orthogonal looks-linear structure in GATE. This also ensures that we have no initial inductive bias or preference for specific neighbor or node features. As an ablation, we also verify that the initialization of the attention parameters in GAT with zero alone can not switch off neighborhood aggregation in GAT (see Fig. 7 in Appendix C). Secondly, the conservation law leads to the insight that a GATE network is more easily capable of switching off neighborhood aggregation or node feature contributions in comparison with GAT. Insight 4.4 (GATE is able to switch off neighborhood ag- gregation.). GATE can flexibly switch off neighborhood aggregation or node features in the well-trainable regime of the attention parameters. This insight follows immediately from the related conser- vation law for GATE that shows that at and as can inter- change the available budget for relative change among each other. Furthermore, the contribution of neighbors and the nodes are controlled separately. We show how the respec- tive switch-off can be achieved with relatively small atten- tion parameter norms that correspond to the well-trainable regime in Appendix A.3. To verify these insights in exper- iments, we next design synthetic data generators that can test the ability of GNNs to take structural infromation into account in a task-appropriate manner. 5. Experiments We validate the ability of GATE to perform the appropri- ate amount of neighborhood aggregation, as relevant for the given task and input graph, on both synthetic and real- world graphs. In order to gauge the amount of neighbor- hood aggregation, we study the distribution of αvv values (over the nodes) at various epochs during training and lay- ers in the network. This serves as a fair proxy since ∀ v ∈ V, αvv = 1 − P u∈N(v),u̸=v αuv. Thus, αvv = 1 implies no neighborhood aggregation (i.e. only hv is used) whereas αvv = 0 implies only neighborhood aggregation (i.e. hv is not used). Figure 2 shows an exemplary con- struction of both these cases. We defer a discussion of the experimental setup to Appendix B. 5.1. Synthetic Test Bed We construct the synthetic test bed as a node classification task for two types of problems: self-sufficient learning and neighbor-dependent learning. In the self-sufficient learning problem, complete label-relevant information is present in 4GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors (a) No neighborhood contribution required. (b) Only neighborhood contribution required. Figure 2: Examples of synthetic input graphs constructed for learning tasks that are (a) self-sufficient and can be bet- ter solved by switching off neighborhood aggregation, i.e. αvv = 1 and (b) neighbor-dependent that benefit from ig- noring the node’s own features, i.e.αvv = 0. In both cases, ∀ v ∈ V, P u∈N(v),u̸=v αuv + αvv = 1. These represent opposite ends of the spectrum whereas real-world tasks of- ten lie in between and require αii ∈ [0, 1]. GATE’s atten- tion mechanism is more flexible than GAT’s in learning the level of neighborhood aggregation required for a task. a node’s own features. On the contrary, in the neighbor- dependent learning problem, label-relevant information is present in the node features of the k-hop neighbors. We discuss both cases in detail, beginning with the simpler one. Learning self-sufficient node labels In order to model this task exactly, we generate an Erd ˝os–R´enyi (ER) graph structure G with N = 1000 nodes and edge probabil- ity p = 0 .01. Node labels yv are assigned uniformly at random from C = [2 , 8] classes. Input node features h0 v are generated as one-hot encoded node labels in both cases, i.e., h0 v = 1yv . Nodes are divided randomly into train/validation/test split with a 2 : 1 : 1 ratio. We also use a real-world graph structure of the Cora dataset. Two cases using this graph structure are tested: i) using the original node labels consisting of7 classes, and ii) randomized labels of 7 classes. Input node features are generated as one-hot encoding of node labels in both cases. The standard splits of Cora are used. Table 1: Self-sufficient learning: S, Cand L denote graph structure, number of label classes, and number of net- work layers, respectively. Original (Orig.) and randomized (Rand.) labels are used for the Cora structure. In all cases, 100% train accuracy is achieved except in ones marked with ∗ and GATE eventually achieves 100% test accuracy a few epochs later except in one marked with ‡. GAT S and GAT models marked with † also eventually achieve 100% test accuracy. GATE S behaves similarly to GATE and achieves 100% train and test accuracy. . S C L Test Acc.@Epoch of Min.

In line with the homophilic nature of Cora, GAT achieves reasonably good accuracy when the original labels of the Cora graph structure are used as neighborhood aggregation is relatively less detrimental, particularly in a single-layer model. Nevertheless, in the same case, GATE generalizes better than GAT with an increase in model depth. This in- dicates that over-smoothing, a major cause of performance degradation with model depth in GNNs, is also alleviated due to reduced neighborhood aggregations (see Fig. 3). On the contrary, random labels pose a real challenge to GAT. Since the neighborhood features are fully uninforma- tive about a node’s label in the randomized case, aggrega- tion over such a neighborhood distorts the fully informa- tive features of the node itself. This impedes the GAT net- work from learning the task, as it is unable to effectively switch off aggregation (see Fig. 3), whereas GATE is able to adapt to the required level of neighborhood aggregation (i.e. none, in this case). Interestingly, note that a single 5GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors (a) GAT with original labels  (b) GAT with random labels (c) GATE with original labels  (d) GATE with random labels Figure 3: Distribution of αvv against training epoch for self-sufficient learning problem using Cora structure and input node features as the one-hot encoding of labels for 1 and 2 layer models. Due to space limitation, we defer the plots of 5 layer networks to Fig. 8 in Appendix C. layer GAT in the case of random labels can almost, though not completely, switch off neighborhood aggregation (see Fig. 3) and achieve (near) perfect accuracy in the simpler cases. This is in line with our theoretical analysis (see In- sight 4.2), as the norms of a single-layer model are not con- strained and thus the attention parameters have more free- dom to change. Overall, the accuracy of GAT worsens drastically along two dimensions simultaneously: i) an increase in the depth of the model (due to increased unnecessary aggregation), and ii) an increase in the complexity of the task (due to an in- crease in the number of classes in an ER graph and conse- quently in node neighborhoods). In the interest of space, we defer results for GATE S to Fig. 9 in Appendix C as aggregation patterns similar to GATE are observed. Having established that GATE excels GAT in avoiding task-irrelevant neighborhood aggregation, it is also impor- tant to verify whether GATE can perform task-relevant neighborhood aggregation when required, and as much as required. We answer this question next by studying the be- havior of GATE, in comparison to GAT, on a synthetically constructed neighbor-dependent learning problem. Learning neighbor-dependent node labels To model this task, we generate an ER graph structure with N = 1000 nodes and edge probability p = 0 .01. Input node features h0 v ∈ Rd are sampled from a multivariate normal distribution N(0d, Id). For simplicity, d = 2. This input graph G is fed to a random GAT network Mk with k layers of width d. Note that this input graph G has no self-loops on nodes (i.e. v /∈ N(v)).The parameters of Mk are initialized with the standard Xavier (Glorot & Ben- gio, 2010) initialization. Thus, for each node v, the node embedding output by Mk, hMk v is effectively a function f Table 2: Neighbor-dependent learning: k and L denote the number of aggregation steps of the random GAT used for label generation and the number of layers of the evaluated network, respectively. Mean test accuracy ±95% confi- dence interval over 5 runs is reported. In all cases, a GATE variant outperforms the GAT variants. We further analyze one experimental run in detail in Table 8 in Appendix C. k L GATS GAT GATE S GATE 1 1 93 .6±1.3 92 .3±1.3 96.4 ± 0.7 93.5±1.3 2 93 .5±0.7 92 .7±2.7 97.9 ± 0.8 94.6±2.1 3 88 .2±4.9 91 .8±3.4 92 .1±4.6 94.0 ± 1.5 2 2 90 .4±1.3 87 .7±1.6 93.8 ± 0.5 88.7±2.5 3 82 .2±4.5 88 .9±2.1 85 .8±2.5 93.4 ± 3.3 4 84 .0±5.0 83 .0±4.8 89.2 ± 2.3 87.8±2.4 3 3 84 .3±3.2 83 .8±2.7 87 .5±1.8 88.6 ± 2.0 4 71 .4±3.9 75 .9±7.6 89.2 ± 1.0 89.0±0.5 5 80 .2±4.8 83 .9±2.2 86 .1±0.8 87.8 ± 1.6 of the k-hop neighboring nodes of node v represented by a random GAT network. Let Nk(v) denote the set of k-hop neighbors of v and v /∈ Nk(v). Finally, we run K-means clustering on the neighborhood aggregated representation of nodes hMk v to divide nodes into C clusters. For simplicity, we set C = 2. This cluster- ing serves as the node labels (i.e. yv = argc∈[C](v ∈ c) for our node classification task. Thus, the label yv of a node v to be learned is highly dependent on the input features of the neighboring nodes h0 u ∈ Nk(v) rather than the node’s own input features h0 v. The generated input data and the real decision boundary for varying k are shown in Fig. 4. Corresponding results in Table 2 and Fig. 5 exhibit that GATE can better detect the amount of necessary neighborhood aggregation than GAT. However, this task is more challenging than the previous one, and GATE too can not achieve perfect100% test accu- racy. This could be attributed to data points close to the real decision boundary which is not crisply defined (see Fig. 4). 5.2. Real-World Data To demonstrate that the ability of GATE to switch-off neighborhood aggregation has real application relevance, we evaluate GATE on relatively large-scale real-world node classification tasks, namely on five heterophilic benchmark datasets (Platonov et al., 2023) (see Table 3) and three OGB datasets (Hu et al., 2021) (see Table 5). We defer results and discussion on five small-scale datasets with varying homophily levels to Table 7 in Appendix C.

Columns (left to right): 3, 4, and 5 layer models. While GAT is unable to switch off neighborhood aggregation in any layer, only 3 layers of the 4 and 5 layer models perform neighborhood aggregation. the potential benefits of combining MLP and GAT layers in GATE, we compare its behavior with GAT and MLP. We argue that the better performance of GATE, by a large margin in most cases, can be attributed to down-weighting unrelated neighbors, leveraging deeper non-linear feature transformations, and reducing over-smoothing. While we focus our exposition on the neighborhood aggre- gation perspective of GATs, we also consider the FAGCN architecture (Bo et al., 2021), which relies on a similar at- tention mechanism and, in theory, could switch off neigh- borhood aggregation when positive and negative contribu- tions of neighbors cancel out. In contrast to GATE, it re- quires tuning a hyperparameter ϵ, which controls the con- tribution of raw node features to each layer. Furthermore, on our synthetic tasks, we find that, like GAT, FAGCN is also unable to limit neighborhood contribution. We also provide a detailed qualitative and quantitative discussion comparing GATE and FAGCN using the synthetic testbed in Appendix C. Next, we analyze GATE’s ability to mix MLP and GAT layers. To this end, we evaluate a GNN architecture con- structed by alternately placing GAT and MLP layers in the network that we denote by MLP +GAT on various het- erophilic tasks. The purpose of this experiment is twofold. Firstly, we observe in Table 3 that MLP+GAT outperforms both GAT and MLP in most cases. This highlights the benefit of only performing non-linear transformations on raw or aggregated neighborhood features without immedi- ate further neighborhood aggregation to learn potentially more complex features. Secondly, we find GATE to outper- form MLP+GAT (see Table 3). This illustrates that rigidly embedding MLP layers in a GNN with arbitrary predefined roles is not ideal as the appropriate degree and placement of neighborhood aggregation is unknown a-priori. In con- trast, GATE offers more flexibility to learn intricate com- binations of GNN layers and nonlinear feature transforma- tions that define more adequate models for a given task, as exemplified in Fig. 6. The distributions ofαvv in Fig. 6 across layers in GATE re- veal information about the relative importance of node fea- ture and graph structure at the node level, which allows us to analyze the question to which degree graph information is helpful for a task. For example, in Fig. 6, we observe that the αvv values are mostly lower in the minesweeper dataset than the roman-empire dataset. This indicates that aggregation, particularly over the input node features and the final layer’s learned representations, is more beneficial compared to the node’s own features for the minesweeper dataset. On the other hand, for roman-empire, the model has a higher preference to utilize features of the node it- self (as most values of αvv approach 1) over features of the neighbors. This aligns with the homophily levels, 0.05 and 0.68, of the roman-empire and minesweeper datasets, re- spectively. A similar analysis for datasets Texas and Actor can be found in Fig. 13 in Appendix C. We also observe in Fig. 6 that when neighborhood aggrega- 7GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors Table 3: We report mean test accuracy ±95% confidence interval for roman-empire and amazon-ratings and AUC-ROC for the other three datasets over the standard 10 splits, following (Platonov et al., 2023).

Figure 6: Distribution of αvv against training epoch for a run of 5 layer networks on real-world heterophilic tasks. As ex- pected, GAT is unable to significantly vary neighborhood aggregation whereas GATE exhibits varying aggregation patterns across layers and tasks. These could be interpreted to indicate the inherent importance of raw node features relative to their neighborhoods for a given task. We defer the plots of the 10-layer models for tolokers dataset to Fig. 11 in Appendix C. tion takes place, the level of aggregation across all nodes, as indicated by the shape of αvv distribution, varies over network layers. This is expected as different nodes need different levels of aggregation depending on where they are situated in the graph topology. For example, peripheral nodes would require more aggregation than central nodes to obtain a similar amount of information. Therefore, as already observed with purposefully constructed synthetic data, GATE offers a more interpretable model than GAT in a real-world setting. While we focus our evaluation in Table 3 on comparison with the most relevant baselines such as attention-based ar- chitectures, we next present a more extensive comparison with 14 other baseline architectures in Table 4. For the re- sults reported in Table 3, we conduct experiments in a sim- ple setting without additional elements that may impact the performance such as skip connections, normalization, etc., to isolate the effect of the architecture and evaluate solely the impact of GATE’s ability to switch off neighborhood aggregation on real-world data. However, for the results in Table 4, we adopt the original codebase of (Platonov et al., 2023), which utilizes such elements to evaluate the performance of baseline GNNs and architectures specifi- cally designed for heterophilic datasets. We evaluate GATE in the same settings optimized for their experiments. For easy comparison, we replicate their results from Table 4 in (Platonov et al., 2023). We observe in Table 4 that while GATE outperforms GAT (and other baselines) significantly, GATE has comparable performance to GAT-sep, a variant of GAT, despite GATE being more parameter efficient by an order of magnitude. More specifically, GAT-sep and GATE introduce d2 and d additional parameters, respectively, in a layer. By corre- spondingly adapting GATE, we find GATE-sep to achieve the best performance in most cases. Therefore, additional techniques generally employed to boost performance are compatible and complementary to GATE. GATE’s ability to benefit from depth in terms of generaliza- tion is demonstrated on OGB datasets (see Table 5).

While the better performance of deeper models with limited neighborhood aggregation in certain layers indi- cates reduced over-smoothing, we also verify this insight quantitatively (see Table 9 in Appendix C). Our experimental code is available at https:// github.com/RelationalML/GATE.git. 6. Conclusion We experimentally illustrate a structural limitation of GAT that disables the architecture, in practice, to switch off task- irrelevant neighborhood aggregation. This obstructs GAT from achieving its intended potential. Based on insights from an existing conservation law of gradient flow dynam- ics in GAT, we have explained the source of this problem. To verify that we have identified the correct issue, we re- solve it with a modification of GAT, which we call GATE, and derive the corresponding modified conservation law. GATE holds multiple advantages over GAT, as it can lever- age the benefits of depth as in MLPs, offer interpretable, learned self-attention coefficients, and adapt the model to the necessary degree of neighborhood aggregation for a given task. We verify this on multiple synthetic and real- world tasks, where GATE significantly outperforms GAT and also achieves a new SOTA test accuracy on the OGB- arxiv dataset. Therefore, we argue that GATE is a suitable candidate to answer highly debated questions related to the importance of a given graph structure for standard tasks. 9GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors Acknowledgements We gratefully acknowledge funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the Horizon Europe Framework Programme (HORIZON) for proposal number 101116395 SPARSE-ML.

GATs are challenged to switch off neighborhood aggregation during training, as this would require the model to enter a less trainable regime with large attention parameters ∥a∥2 >> 1. We have to distinguish GATs with and without weight sharing in our analysis. GATs with weight sharing: To investigate the ability of a GAT to switch off neighborhood aggregation, let us focus on a link(i, j) that should neither contribute to the feature transformation of i nor j. This implies that we need to find attention parameters a (and potentially feature transformations W) so that αij/αii << 1 with αij/αii = exp ( eij − eii). This implies that we require eij − eii << 0 and thus aT ϕ (W (hi + hj)) − 2aT ϕ (W (hi)) << 0. Since we also require αij/αjj << 1, it follows from adding both inequalities that aT [ϕ (W (hi + hj)) − (ϕ (Whi) + ϕ (Whj))] << 0. This inequality can only be fulfilled if there exists at least one feature f for which ∆fij ; = a[f] [ϕ (W[f, :] (hi + hj)) − (ϕ (W[f, :]hi) + ϕ (W[f, :]hi))] fulfills ∆fij << 0. Yet, note that if both ϕ (W[f, :]hi) and ϕ (W[f, :]hj) are positive or both are negative, we just get ∆fij = 0 because of the definition of a LeakyReLU. Thus, there must exist at least one feature f so that without loss of generality ϕ (W[f, :]hi) < 0 and ϕ (W[f, :]hj) > 0. It follows that if a[f] > 0 that 0 > a[f]ϕ (W[f, :]hi) >> a[f] (ϕ (W[f, :] (hi + hj)) − ϕ (W[f, :]hj)) > a[f] (ϕ (W[f, :] (hi + hj)) − 2ϕ (W[f, :]hj)) also receives a negative contribution that makes αij/αjj smaller. Yet, what happens to αij/αii? By distinguishing two cases, namely W[f, :] (hi + hj) > 0 or W[f, :] (hi + hj) < 0 and computing a[f] [ϕ (W (hi + hj)) − 2ϕ (W[f, :]hj)] > 0 we find the feature contribution to be positive. If a[f] < 0, then 0 > a[f]ϕ (W[f, :]hj) >> a[f] (ϕ (W[f, :] (hi + hj)) − ϕ (W[f, :]hi)) > a[f] (ϕ (W[f, :] (hi + hj)) − 2ϕ (W[f, :]hi)) and αij/αjj is reduced. Similarly, we can derive that at the same time αij/αii is increased, however. This implies that any feature that contributes to reducing ∆fij automatically increases one feature while it increases another. We therefore need multiple featuresf to contribute to reducing either αij/αii or αij/αjj to compensate for other increases. This implies, in order to switch off neighborhood aggregation, we would need a high dimensional space of features that cater to switching off specific links without strengthening others. Furthermore, they would need large absolute values of a[f] and norms of W[f, :] or exploding feature vectors h to achieve this. Yet, all these norms are constrained by the derived conservation law and therefore prevent learning a representation that switches off full neighborhoods. GATs without weight sharing: The flow of argumentation without weight sharing is very similar to the one above with weight sharing. Yet, we have to distinguish more cases. 13GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors Similarly to before, we require αij/αjj << 1 and αji/αii << 1. It follows from adding both related inequalities that aT [ϕ (Wshi + Wthj) + ϕ (Wshj + Wthi) − ϕ ((Ws + Wt) hi) − ϕ ((Ws + Wt) hj)] << 0. This implies that for at least one feature f, we require a[f][ϕ \u0000 Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj \u0001 + ϕ \u0000 Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi \u0001 − ϕ ((Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hi) − ϕ ((Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj)] << 0. (9) Again, our goal is to show that this feature automatically decreases the contribution of one feature while it increases another. As argued above, switching off neighborhood aggregation would therefore need a high dimensional space of features that cater to switching off specific links without strengthening others. Furthermore, they would need large absolute values of a[f] and norms of W[f, :] or exploding feature vectors h to achieve this. Our derived norm constraints, however, prevent learning such a model representation. Concretely, without loss of generality, we therefore have to show that if a[f][ϕ \u0000 Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj \u0001 − ϕ \u0000\u0000 Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :] \u0001 hj \u0001 < 0, (10) at the same time, we receive a[f][ϕ \u0000 Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi \u0001 − ϕ \u0000\u0000 Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :] \u0001 hi \u0001 > 0, (11) (or vice versa). In principle, we have to show this for 16 different cases of pre-activation sign configurations for the four terms in Eq. (9). Yet, since the argument is symmetric with respect to exchanging i and j, only 8 different cases remain. Two trivial cases are identical signs for all four terms. These are excluded, as the left hand side (LHS) of Eq. (9) would become zero and thus not contribute to our goal to switch off neighborhood aggregation. In the following, we will discuss the remaining six cases. Please note that for the remainder of this derivation α >0 denotes the slope of the leakyReLU and not the attention weights αij. 1. Case (+ − ++): Let us assume that Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj > 0, Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi < 0, (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hi > 0, and (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj > 0. From this assumption and the fact that ϕ is a leakyReLU it follows that the LHS of Eq. (9) be- comes: a[f][ϕ \u0000 Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj \u0001 + ϕ \u0000 Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi \u0001 − ϕ \u0000\u0000 Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :] \u0001 hi \u0001 − ϕ \u0000\u0000 Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :] \u0001 hj \u0001 ] = a[f](α −1)[Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi]. Since α −1 < 0 and [Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, : ]hi] < 0 according to our assumption, Eq. (9) demands a[f] < 0. To switch off neighborhood aggregation, we would need to be able to make the LHS of Eq. (10) and Eq. (11) Eq. (11) negative. Yet, a negative a[f] leads to a positive LHS of Eq. (11). Thus, the assumed sign configuration cannot support switching off neighborhood aggregation. 2. Case (+ − −−): Let us assume that Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj > 0, Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi < 0, (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hi < 0, and (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj < 0. The LHS of Eq. (9) becomes a[f](1 −α)[Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj], which demands a[f] < 0. Accordingly, the LHS of Eq. (10) is clearly negative, while the LHS of Eq. (11) is a[f]αWs[f, :](hj − hi) > 0. The last inequality follows from our assumptions that implyWs[f, :]hj < Ws[f, :]hi by combining the assumptions (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj < 0 and Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj > 0. Again, this result implies that the considered sign configuration does not support switching off neighborhood aggregation. 3. Case (+ + + −): Let us assume that Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj > 0, Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi > 0, (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hi > 0, and (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj < 0. The LHS of Eq. (9) becomes a[f](1 −α)[Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hj], which demands a[f] > 0. Accordingly, the LHS of Eq. (10) becomes positive, which hampers switching-off neighborhood aggregation as discussed. 14GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors 4. Case (− − −+): Let us assume that Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj < 0, Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi < 0, (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hi < 0, and (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj > 0. The LHS of Eq. (9) becomes a[f](α −1)[Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hj], which demands a[f] > 0. Accordingly, the LHS of Eq. (10) becomes clearly negative. However, the LHS of Eq. (11) is positive, asa[f]αWs[f, :](hj − hi) > 0. The last inequality follows from our assumptions that imply Ws[f, :]hj > Ws[f, :]hi by combining the assumptions (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj > 0 and Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj < 0. Again, this analysis implies that the considered sign configuration does not support switching off neighborhood aggregation. 5. Case (+ − +−): Let us assume that Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj > 0, Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi < 0, (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hi > 0, and (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj < 0. According to our assumptions the LHS of Eq. (10) can only be negative if a[f] < 0. Yet, the LHS of Eq. (11) can only be negative if a[f] > 0. Thus, this case clearly cannot contribute to switching off neighborhood aggregation. 6. Case (+ − −+): Let us assume that Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj > 0, Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi < 0, (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hi < 0, and (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj > 0. Eq. (9) becomes a[f](1 − α)Ws[f, :] (hi − hj) < 0. At the same time, the LHS of Eq. (10) simplifies to a[f]Ws[f, : ](hi − hj) and the LHS of Eq. (11) is a[f]αWs[f, :](hj − hi) > 0. Hence, a negative Eq. (9) leads to a positive Eq. (11). Accordingly, the last possible sign configuration also does not support switching off neighborhood aggregation, which concludes our derivation. A.2. Proof of Theorem 4.3 Statement (Restated Theorem 4.3). The gradients and parameters of GATE for layer l ∈ [L − 1] are conserved according to the following laws: ⟨Wl[i, :], ∇Wl[i,:]L⟩ = ⟨Wl+1[:, i], ∇Wl+1[:,i]L⟩ + ⟨al+1 s [i], ∇al+1 s [i]L⟩ + ⟨al+1 t [i], ∇al+1 t [i]L⟩. (12) and, if additional independent matrices Ul and Vl are trainable, it also holds ⟨al s[i], ∇als[i]L⟩ + ⟨al t[i], ∇al t[i]L⟩ = ⟨Ul[i, :], ∇Ul[i,:]L⟩ + ⟨V l[i, :], ∇V l[i,:]L⟩. (13) The proof is analogous to the derivation of Theorem 2.2 by (Mustafa & Burkholz, 2023) that is restated in this work as Theorem 4.1. For ease, we replicate their notation and definitions here. Statement (Rescale invariance: Def 5.1 by Mustafa & Burkholz (2023)). The loss L(θ) is rescale-invariant with respect to disjoint subsets of the parametersθ1 and θ2 if for everyλ >0 we haveL(θ) = L((λθ1, λ−1θ2, θd)), where θ = (θ1, θ2, θd). Statement (Gradient structure due to rescale invariance Lemma 5.2 in (Mustafa & Burkholz, 2023)). The rescale invariance of L enforces the following geometric constraint on the gradients of the loss with respect to its parameters: ⟨θ1, ∇θ1L⟩ − ⟨θ2, ∇θ2L⟩ = 0. (14) We first consider the simpler case of GATES, i.e. W = U = V Theorem A.1 (Structure of GATES gradients). The gradients and parameters of GATES for layer l ∈ [L−1] are conserved according to the following laws: ⟨Wl[i, :], ∇Wl[i,:]L⟩ = ⟨Wl+1[:, i], ∇Wl+1[:,i]L⟩ + ⟨al s[i], ∇als[i]L⟩ + ⟨al t[i], ∇al t[i]L⟩. (15) Following a similar strategy to (Mustafa & Burkholz, 2023), we identify rescale invariances for every neuron i at layer l that induce the stated gradient structure. Given the following definition of disjoint subsets θ1 and θ2 of the parameter set θ, associated with neuron i in layer l, 15GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors θ1 = {x|x ∈ Wl[i, :]} θ2 = {w|w ∈ Wl+1[:, i]} ∪ {al s[i]} ∪ {al t[i]} We show that the loss of GATES remains invariant for any λ >0. The only components of the network that potentially change under rescaling are hl u[i], hl+1 v [j], and αl uv. The scaled network parameters are denoted with a tilde as ˜as l[i] = λ−1al s[i], ˜at l[i] = λ−1al t[i], and ˜Wl[i, j] = λWl[i, j], and the corresponding networks components scaled as a result are denoted by ˜hl u[i], ˜hl+1 v [k], and ˜αl uv. We show that the parameters of upper layers remain unaffected, as ˜hl+1 v [k] coincides with its original non-scaled variant ˜hl+1 v [k] = hl+1 v [k]. Also recall Eq. (4) for W = U = V as: el uv = ((1 − quv)al s + (quv)al t)⊤ · ϕ(Wlhl−1 u + Wlhl−1 v ) where quv = 1 if u = v and quv = 0 if u ̸= v. For simplicity, we rewrite this as: el uv,u̸=v = (al s)⊤ · ϕ(Wlhl−1 u + Wlhl−1 v ) (16) el uv,u=v = (al t)⊤ · ϕ(Wlhl−1 u + Wlhl−1 v ) (17) We show that ˜αl uv = exp(˜el uv)P u′∈N(v) exp(˜eluv) = αl uv , because (18) ˜el uv,u̸=v = el uv,u̸=v , and ˜el uv,u=v = el uv,u=v (19) which follows from the positive homogeneity of ϕ that allows ˜el uv,u=v = λ−1al s[i]ϕ( nl−1X j λWl[i, j](hl−1 u [j] + hl−1 v [j]) + nlX i′̸=i al s[i′]ϕ( nl−1X j Wl[i′, j](hl−1 u [j] + hl−1 v [j]) (20) = λ−1λal s[i]ϕ( nl−1X j Wl[i, j](hl−1 u [j] + hl−1 v [j]) + nlX i′̸=i al s[i′]ϕ( nl−1X j Wl[i′, j](hl−1 u [j] + hl−1 v [j]) (21) = el uv,u̸=v. (22) and similarly, 16GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors ˜el uv,u=v = λ−1al t[i]ϕ( nl−1X j λWl[i, j](hl−1 u [j] + hl−1 v [j]) + nlX i′̸=i al t[i′]ϕ( nl−1X j Wl[i′, j](hl−1 u [j] + hl−1 v [j]) (23) = λ−1λal t[i]ϕ( nl−1X j Wl[i, j](hl−1 u [j] + hl−1 v [j]) + nlX i′̸=i al t[i′]ϕ( nl−1X j Wl[i′, j](hl−1 u [j] + hl−1 v [j]) (24) = el uv,u=v. (25) Since ˜αl uv = αl uv, it follows that ˜hu l [i] = ϕ1   X z∈N(u) αl zu nl−1X j λWl[i, j]hl−1 z [j]   = λϕ1   X z∈N(u) αl zu nl−1X j Wl[i, j]hl−1 z [j]   = λhl u[i]. In the next layer, we therefore have ˜hl+1 v [k] = ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i λ−1Wl+1[k, i]˜hl u[i]   = ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i λ−1Wl+1[k, i]λhl u[i]   = ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i Wl+1[k, i]hl u[i]   = hl+1 v [k]. Thus, the output node representations of the network remain unchanged, and the loss L is rescale-invariant. Next consider the case that Wl, Ul, and V l are independent matrices. Similarly to the previous reasoning, we see that if we scale ˜Wl[i, :] = Wl[i, :]λ, then also scaling ˜Wl+1[:, i] = Wl+1[:, i]λ−1 and ˜al+1 s [i] = al+1 s [i]λ−1 and ˜al+1 t [i] = al+1 t [i]λ−1 will keep the GATE layer unaltered. In this case, we obtain an additional rescaling relationship between al s, al t and Ul, V l. A rescaling of the form ˜as l[i] = λ−1al s[i], ˜at l[i] = λ−1al t[i] could be compensated by ˜Ul[i, :] = Ul[i, :]λ and ˜V l[i, :] = V l[i, :]λ. It follows immediately that ˜euv = euv. A.3. Derivation of Insight 4.4 Following the analysis in A.1, in contrast to GAT, αij/αii << 1 can be easily realized in GATE with as[f] < 0 and at[f] > 0 for all or only a subset of the features. Note that for the non-weight-sharing case, U and V in GATE would simply correspond to Ws and Wt, respectively, in GATE and the same line of reasoning holds. Large norms are usually not required to create a notable difference in size between eii and eij. 17GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors B. Experimental Settings Our complete experimental setup is described as follows. Non-linearity For GATS and GAT networks, we substitute ϕ in Eq. (3) with LeakyReLU as defined in the standard architecture. For GATE, we substitute ϕ in Eq. (4) with ReLU in order to be able to interpret the sign of as and at parameters as contributing positively or negatively to neighborhood aggregation. MLP, MLP +GAT , and FAGCN also all use ReLU after every hidden layer. Network Width We vary the depth of GAT and GATE networks in all our experiments as specified. For synthetic datasets, the network width is fixed to 64 in all cases. For OGB datasets, we use the hidden dimensions used by (Brody et al., 2022). For the remaining datasets, the network width is also fixed to 64. Initialization The feature transformation parameter matrices, i.e.,W, U, and V are initialized randomly with an orthog- onal looks-linear structure (Burkholz & Dubatovka, 2019) for MLP, MLP+GAT , GAT(S) and GATE(S). The parameters a in GAT(S) use Xavier initialization (Glorot & Bengio, 2010), as is the standard. In GATE(S), as and at are initialized to 0 to initially give equal weights to the features of a node itself and its neighboring nodes. Optimization Synthetic, OGB, and remaining real-world tasks are run for a maximum of 10000, 2000, 5000 epochs, respectively, using the Adam optimizer. To isolate the effect of the architecture and study the parameter dynamics during training as best as possible, we do not use any additional elements such as weight decay and dropout regularization. We also do not perform any hyperparameter optimization. However, the learning rate is adjusted for different real-world datasets to enable stable training of models as specified in Table 6. Nevertheless, for a fair comparison, the same learning rate is used for a given problem across all architectures. For all synthetic data, a learning rate of 0.005 is used. Real-world datasets use their standard train/test/validation splits, i.e. those provided by Pytorch Geometric for Planetoid datasets Cora and Citeseer, by OGB framework for OGB datasets, and by (Platonov et al., 2023) for all remaining real-world datasets.

Additional Results Smaller Real-World Datasets We evaluate GAT and GATE on five small-scale real-world datasets with varying ho- mophily levels β as defined in (Pei et al., 2020) and report results in Table 7. Higher values ofβ indicate higher homophily, i.e. similar nodes (with the same label) tend to be connected. We note that a 2-layer network of a baseline method for het- erophilic datasets, Geom-GCN (Pei et al., 2020), attains test accuracy (%) of64.1, 67.6, and 31.6 for Wisconsin, Texas, and Actor datasets, respectively, which is in line with that achieved by GATE. Except for Citeseer, the best overall performance for each dataset is achieved on a shallow model. This is not surprising as these datasets are small-scale and potentially prone to over-fitting in large models, particularly since we do not use any skip connections or regularization to retain model performance. Furthermore, the three heterophilic datasets have been recently shown to be problematic (Platonov et al., 2023). Therefore, a better evaluation of GATE is on relatively large-scale OGB datasets (Hu et al., 2021) and more recent heterophilic datasets (Platonov et al., 2023) that can exploit the flexibility of GATE. Although GATE is more pa- rameterized than GAT, it usually requires fewer training epochs and generalizes better, in addition to other advantages over GAT as discussed in the paper.

Training the model to run to 15000 epochs only increases it to 98.4%. An increased learning rate did not improve this case. However, we also run the GAT model for 15000 epochs for this case, and it achieves 85.9% test accuracy at epoch 47 where the model achieves 100% accuracy and only achieves a maximum test accuracy of 89.3% briefly at epoch 8. 20GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors Figure 10: Distribution of αvv against training epoch for the neighbor-dependent learning problem withk = 1. Rows: GAT (top) and GATE (bottom) architecture. Columns (left to right): 1, 2, and 3 layer models. While GAT is unable to switch off neighborhood aggregation in any layer, only 1 layer of the 2 and 3 layer models perform neighborhood aggregation. Table 8: Neighbor-dependent learning: k and L denote the number of aggregation steps of the random GAT used for label generation and the number of layers of the evaluated network, respectively. Entries marked with * identify models where 100% train accuracy is not achieved. Underlined entries identify the model with the highest train accuracy at the epoch of max. test accuracy. This provides an insight into how similar the function represented by the trained model is to the function used to generate node labels, i.e. whether the model is simply overfitting to the train data or really learning the task. Higher training and test accuracy simultaneously indicate better learning. In this regard, the difference in train accuracy at max. test accuracy between GATE and GATS or GAT is only 0.4, 1.0 and 0.6 for the settings (k = 1, L= 3), (k = 2, L= 4) and (k = 3, L= 3), respectively. k L Test Acc. @ Epoch of Max.

Figure 13: Distribution of αvv, against training epoch of 2-layer (left) and 5-layer (right) GATE networks for heterophilic datasets Texas (top) and Actor (bottom), across layers could be interpreted to indicate the inherent importance of raw node features relative to their neighborhoods. For instance, in the case of Texas, GATE carries out little to no neighborhood aggregation in the first layer over input node features. Instead, aggregation is mainly done over node features transformed in earlier layers that effectuate non-linear feature learning as in perceptrons. However, in the case of Actor, GATE prefers most of the neighborhood aggregation to occur over the input node features, indicating that they are more informative for the task at hand. 22GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors Over-smoothing analysis In the main paper, we have already established the superior performance of GATE, compared to GAT, on several tasks. Intuitively, this can partially be attributed to reduced over-smoothing as its root cause, unnecessary neighborhood aggregation, is alleviated. Here, we verify this insight quantitatively. A widely accepted measure of over-smoothing is the Dirichlet energy (DE) (Cai & Wang, 2020). However, Eliasof et al. (2023) propose a modification of DE to measure GAT energy EGAT , that we use to evaluate over-smoothing in our experiments (see Table 9). We note that the notion of ‘over-smoothing’ is itself task-dependent. It is difficult to determine the optimal degree of smoothing for a task and the threshold that determines ‘over’-smoothing. This merits an in-depth analysis and curation of task-dependent smoothness measures that are not our focus. To show that GATE reduced over- smoothing relative to GAT, it suffices that a decrease in smoothing and an increase in accuracy occur simultaneously. Table 9: The measures Einput, EGAT and EGATE denote the smoothness of input node features, node features at the last layer L of the trained GAT and GATE models, respectively. Two cases are considered: All node pairs and only adjacent node pairs to measure smoothing at the global graph and local node level. Higher values indicate less smoothing. Node representations learned by GATE achieve higher test accuracy on all these tasks, as reported in the main paper, and are simultaneously less smooth than GAT in most cases, indicating that GATE potentially alleviates over-smoothing in GATs.

However, they are less flexible in assigning different importance to neighbors, suffer from over-smoothing, or come at the cost of an increased parameter count by increasing the size of the hidden dimensions (e.g. via a concatena- tion operation). We evaluate the performance of three such architectures that, in principle, employ different aggregation methods, which are likely to be capable of switching off neighborhood aggregation, on synthetic datasets empirically and discuss their ability or inability to switch off neighborhood aggregation qualitatively as follows. 1. ωGAT (Eliasof et al., 2023) introduces an additional feature-wise layer parameter ω that can, in principle, switch off neighborhood aggregation by setting ω parameters to 0, in addition to the attention mechanism based on GAT. How- ever, in practice, as we verify on our synthetic dataset in Figure 14, it is unable to effectively switch off neighborhood aggregation. Although it outperforms GAT, it is still substantially worse than GATE, especially for the deeper model due to unnecessary neighborhood aggregations. Another architecture based on graph attention, superGAT(Kim & Oh, 2021), falls under the paradigm of structural learning as it uses a self-supervised attention mechanism essentially for link prediction between nodes, and therefore its comparison with GATE is infeasible. 2. GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2018) uses the concatenation operation to combine the node’s own representation with the aggregated neighborhood representation. Therefore, it is usually (but not always) able to switch off the neigh- borhood aggregation for the synthetic datasets designed for the self-sufficient learning task (see Table 10). Mostly, GATE performs better on the neighbor-dependent task, in particular for deeper models, where the performance of GraphSAGE drops likely due to over-smoothing (see Table 11). 3. FAGCN (Bo et al., 2021) requires a slightly more detailed analysis. Authors of FAGCN state in the paper that: ‘When αG ij ≈ 0, the contributions of neighbors will be limited, so the raw features will dominate the node representations.’ where αG ij defined in the paper can be considered analogous to αij in GAT, though they are defined differently. Thus, from an expressivity point of view, FAGCN should be able to assign parameters such that all αG ij = 0. However, we empirically observe on synthetic datasets designed for the self-sufficient learning task, values of αG ij do not, in fact, approach zero. Despite being unable to switch off neighborhood aggregation, FAGCN, in its default implementation, achieves 100% test accuracy on the task. We discover this is so because FAGCN introduces direct skip connections of non-linearly transformed raw node features to every hidden layer. Given the simplicity of the one-hot encoded features in the datasets and the complete dependence of the label on these features, FAGCN is able to represent the desired function. In order to better judge its ability to switch off neighborhood aggregation by setting αG ij = 0, we remove this skip connection. From an expressivity point of view, FAGCN should still be able to achieve 100% test accuracy by using only the (non-)linear transformations of raw features initially and performing no neighborhood aggregation in the hidden layers. However, we find that FAGCN was unable to emulate this behavior in practice. For a fair comparison of the differently designed attention mechanism in FAGCN with GATE, we introduce self-loops in the data so FAGCN may also receive a node’s own features in every hidden layer. Even then, FAGCN fails to achieve perfect test accuracy as shown in Table 10. Therefore, we suspect the attention mechanism in FAGCN may also be susceptible to the trainability issues we have identified for the attention mechanism in GAT. Nevertheless, the capacity of FAGCN to learn negative associations with neighboring nodes is complementary to GATE and both could be combined. It would be interesting to derive conservation laws inherent to other architectures such as FAGCN and GraphSAGE and study how they govern the behaviour of parameters. Furthermore, by design, FAGCN does not perform any non-linear transformations of aggregated neighborhood features which may be necessary in some tasks, such as our synthetic dataset for the neighbor-dependent learning task. As Table 11 shows, GATE outperforms FAGCN on such a task. Lastly, we would like to emphasize that our aim is to provide insights into the attention mechanism of GAT and understand its limitations. While it should be able to flexibly assign importance to neighbors and the node itself without the need for concatenated representation or explicit skip connections of the raw features to every layer, it is currently unable to do so in practice. In order to verify our identification of trainability issues, we modify the GAT architecture to enable the trainability of attention parameters which control the trade-off between node features and structural information. 24GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors Figure 14: Distribution of αvv against training epoch for self-sufficient learning problem using the Cora structure with random labels, where input node features are a one-hot encoding of node labels, for theωGAT architecture for the1, 2 and 5 layer models that achieve test accuracy of 100%, 98.5%, and 49.3%, respectively.

        "main_contributions": "The paper identifies and experimentally demonstrates a structural limitation of Graph Attention Networks (GATs): their inability to switch off task-irrelevant neighborhood aggregation, which leads to over-smoothing and performance degradation. It proposes GATE, an extension of GAT, that overcomes this limitation by enabling flexible weighting of node and neighborhood features. GATE alleviates over-smoothing, leverages deeper non-linear transformations akin to perceptrons, and often outperforms GATs on real-world heterophilic datasets. It also offers interpretable learned self-attention coefficients. GATE achieves a new state-of-the-art test accuracy on the OGB-arxiv dataset (79.57 \t 0.84%).",
        "methodology": "The core methodology involves modifying the GAT architecture by introducing GATE, which uses separate attention parameters ('as' for neighbor contributions and 'at' for a node's self-loop contribution) for the node and its neighborhood. This architectural change allows GATE to flexibly weight the importance of node features and neighborhood features. The theoretical basis is an updated conservation law for GATE gradients (Theorem 4.3), which shows that 'at' and 'as' can interchange their available budget for relative change, enabling neighborhood aggregation to be switched on or off in a well-trainable parameter regime, unlike GATs (Insight 4.2 and 4.4). Initialization of 'as' and 'at' to zero initially gives equal weights. The non-linear activation function \t in GATE is ReLU for interpretability.",
        "experimental_setup": "The evaluation includes both synthetic and real-world graphs. The synthetic test bed consists of two node classification problems: 'self-sufficient learning' (label-relevant information in node's own features, using Erdős–Rényi graphs and Cora structure with original/randomized labels) and 'neighbor-dependent learning' (label-relevant information in k-hop neighbors, using Erdős–Rényi graphs with multivariate normal features and K-means labels). Real-world datasets include five heterophilic benchmarks (roman-empire, amazon-ratings, questions, minesweeper, tolokers), three OGB datasets (OGB-arxiv, OGB-products, OGB-mag), and smaller-scale datasets (Cora, Citeseer, Actor, Texas, Wisconsin). Performance metrics are test accuracy and AUC-ROC. Validation involves analyzing the distribution of attention coefficients (\t) and quantitative measures of over-smoothing using a modified Dirichlet energy (EGAT). Models are trained with Adam optimizer for a maximum of 10000, 2000, or 5000 epochs, without weight decay or dropout regularization, using fixed learning rates for comparison across architectures.",
        "limitations": "The paper primarily discusses the limitations of GATs that GATE aims to address. For GATE itself, while its benefits are highlighted, it's noted that 'over-smoothing' is a task-dependent concept, and determining the optimal degree of smoothness or a precise threshold for 'over-smoothing' is difficult. For smaller-scale datasets, deeper GATE models, like other GNNs, might be prone to overfitting without additional elements like skip connections or regularization, which were intentionally excluded in some comparative experiments to isolate architectural effects. Additionally, while FAGCN could theoretically switch off aggregation, empirical results showed it failed to emulate desired behavior, potentially due to susceptibility to trainability issues, which could be seen as a limitation of similar attention mechanisms. The neighbor-dependent task, even for GATE, did not achieve perfect 100% test accuracy, attributed to data points close to a not-crisply-defined decision boundary.",
        "future_research_directions": "Future research directions include using GATE to answer highly debated questions related to the importance of a given graph structure for standard tasks. The constructed synthetic test bed is of independent interest for measuring progress in developing adaptive neighborhood aggregation schemes. The paper also suggests that the capacity of architectures like FAGCN to learn negative associations with neighboring nodes could be complementary to GATE, hinting at potential combinations. Further derivation and study of conservation laws inherent to other architectures like FAGCN and GraphSAGE to understand their parameter behavior is also mentioned as a potential area."

Through extensive experiments on neural machine translation, language modeling, graph representation learning and image classiﬁcation, we demonstrate SAC is competitive with state-of-the-art models while signiﬁcantly reducing memory cost. 1 Introduction The self-attention mechanism has proved to beneﬁt a wide range of ﬁelds and tasks, such as natural language processing (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dai et al., 2019), computer vision (Xu et al., 2015; Jaderberg et al., 2015; Bello et al., 2019; Parmar et al., 2019), video classiﬁcation (Wang et al., 2018) and graph modeling (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019). The attention mechanism allows the model to attend to different parts of the input and capture the most salient features, and provides with the ability to handle dependencies between elements across long distances. Two conspicuous problems stand out with the self-attention mechanism: (1) the memory complexity is quadratic with respect to the input length, making it infeasible to handle long sequences; and (2) the self-attention operations are performed in a pre-deﬁned structure (usually fully-connected), which not only is costly but also lacks for the ability to learn the optimal attention structure optimized for the performance in the downstream tasks (Child et al., 2019; Sukhbaatar et al., 2019). These observations indicate that the fully-connected structure for self-attention operations can be replaced by a more sparse one where only speciﬁc edges are constructed for attention operations. In this paper, we present Sparse Adaptive Connection (SAC), which replaces the fully-connected structure in self-attention with a sparse graph-like structure adapted to different tasks. In SAC, we regard the input as a graph where a node could be a token in the sequence or an ﬂattened feature map of an image, and an edge between a pair of nodes represents they can attend to each other. To select edges, we propose an Edge Predictor which utilizes an LSTM model to dynamically predict pairs of nodes that represent two ends of an edge. In contrast with previous self-attention models with pre-deﬁned attention structures (edges), SAC learns to construct attention edges adaptively, which are optimized to improve task-speciﬁc performances using reinforcement learning models. We 34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020), Vancouver, Canada. arXiv:2003.09833v3  [cs.CL]  29 Sep 2020evaluate the proposed model on four tasks: neural machine translation, language modeling, graph representation learning and image classiﬁcation, and demonstrate that SAC learns to select the most salient nodes to attend to each other and is free from heavy memory cost while achieving strong performances. 2 Related Work Many recent researches have focused on modifying the structure of self-attention to relieve the computation and memory burden. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) enables learning long-term dependency by introducing a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel relative position encoding scheme (Shaw et al., 2018). (Guo et al., 2019) proposed Star Transformer, a variant of Transformer which replaces the fully-connected structure in self-attention with a star-shaped topology, where all tokens are connected with a relay node. (Child et al., 2019; Kitaev et al., 2020) suggest sparsifying Transformer by focusing only on a fraction of attention connections. (Child et al., 2019) introduced sparse factorizations of the attention matrix, which scale as O(np√n) with the sequence length, and a set of sparse attention kernels which efﬁciently compute subsets of the attention matrix. (Kitaev et al., 2020) proposed Reformer, a more efﬁcient yet complicated method for computing self-attention, where the dot-product attention is replaced by one that uses a locality-sensitive hashing, reducing the complexity from O(n2) to O(nlog n). (Ye et al., 2019) partitioned the sequence to different multi-scale spans and attended the context information from ﬁne-grain to coarse-grain as the relative distance increases. All above works rely on manually designed structures. Our work is inspired by (Sukhbaatar et al., 2019), which takes a step forward and uses a novel adaptive self- attention mechanism that can learn its optimal attention span for each head, and (Correia et al., 2019) which proposed adaptively sparse Transformer. Different from Yang et al. (2018), we use an LSTM to predict attention links which gives us ﬁner control of how sparse we want self-attention to be. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are known at learning local contextual information by encoding attribute features (Kipf and Welling, 2016; Hamilton et al., 2017b), but they are not able to explic- itly distinguish the most salient nodes from all its neighbors, neither can they directly attend to the nodes that are beyond one-hop away. Much work has investigated the effect of attention on GNNs (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2018; Abu-El-Haija et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018; Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2019). (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2018) extended self-attention to graphs by enabling each node to attend over its neighbors, achieving state-of-the-art results for semi-supervised node classiﬁcation tasks. But they simply applied self-attention over graphs to all neighbors of a node, which might be a problem when dealing with large and noisy graphs where only few neighbors need to be aggregated. (Ye and Ji, 2019) proposed Sparse Graph Attention Network which uses a binary gate to control whether each edge should be engaged. However, these works lack ability to aggregate long-range dependencies in graphs, and they only consider neighbors that are one hop away. Various methods have been proposed to tackle this issue (Ye et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Pei et al., 2020). Similar to graphs, (Bello et al., 2019) introduced a novel two-dimensional relative self-attention mechanism for images and augmented convolutional operators with this self-attention method, showing systematic improvements on both image classiﬁcation and object detection tasks across a wide range of architectures. 3 Background: Self-Attention Given a set of nodes1 {e1,··· ,eN}as inputs, self-attention iteratively computes the representation of ei in the l-th layer by attending to all its neighbors N(ei), which is deﬁned as follows: ˜hl i = ∑ ej∈N(ei) αijvl−1 j , αij = softmax   ( ql−1 i )T kl−1 j√ d   and ql−1 i = WQhl−1 i , kl−1 j = WKhl−1 j , vl−1 j = WVhl−1 j (1) where dis the hidden dimension, WQ,WK,WV are learnable parameters and q,k,v correspond to queries, keys and values, respectively. The multi-head mechanism linearly projects the queries, keys 1We use the term “node’ in a broad sense of denoting any particular unit in text, images or graphs. 2and values multiple times with different learned linear projections, and then performs self-attention in parallel, after which the results are concatenated and again projected: hl i = Concat(˜hl,1 i ,··· ,˜hl,m i )WO (2) where the superscript 1,···,m denotes the head number, and WO is learnable parameters. After L iterations, we obtain the ﬁnal representation for each node hL i . 4 Sparse Adaptive Connection for Self-Attention The key point in SAC is to use to an LSTM edge predictor to predict edges for self-attention operations between nodes, where a node could be a token in the sequence or an ﬂattened feature map of an image. Self-attention operations are performed between linked nodes instead of in a fully-connected manner. The LSTM edge predictor is optimized to improve task-speciﬁc performances using reinforcement learning models. 4.1 LSTM Edge Predictor In SAC, an edge predictor is used to construct edges between nodes for self-attention operations. Suppose that we are given a set of nodes {e1,··· ,eN}with no edge between any pair of nodes when initialization, our aim is to generate edges using this edge predictor, with the total number αN for each layer, where αis a hyperparameter deciding how many edges should be constructed for each node on average. The Edge Predictor uses an LSTM model as a backbone and sequentially predicts edges. The prediction of an edge is decoupled into the prediction of the original node and the destination node pair. More formally, the input to Edge Predictor is a special token “[SOS]”, and the model proceeds to predict the original node and destination node of all edges (2αN nodes in total) for the ﬁrst layer, denoted by {y1 1,y1 2,··· ,y1 2αN}, where the superscript denoted the index of the layer and the subscript denoted the index of the predicted node. At each time step, the input to the LSTM model is the representation hyt for the node that has just been predicted. Then it is combined with the previously constructed representation gt to obtain gt+1 representing the current time-step using LSTMs, and gt+1 is used to predict the following node using the softmax function. The projection matrix before softmax W shares embeddings with node representations, where each column wi is the vector representation for node ei. The probability of predicting node yt+1 given gt+1 is thus given by: p(yt+1 = ei) = exp (gT t+1 ·wi)∑ jexp (gT t+1 ·wj) (3) This process is repeated 2αN times. After the end of αN edge predictions, we update the representa- tion for each node based on self-attention as will be detailed in Section 4.1 for different tasks, and proceed to the next layer. For node predictions in the following layer, the initial input now becomes hidden state for the last time-step of the previous layer. The entire process is repeated Ltimes, where Ldenotes the number of self-attention layers and the resulted nodes in layerlare {yl 1,yl 2,··· ,yl 2αN}. Compared to separately predicting edges for each node, this approach is more ﬂexible and gives us ﬁner control of the total number of edges we would like to construct. More importantly, this process is aware of previous constructed edges, both in the current layer and previous layers. The recurrent edge predictor is shown in Figure 1(b). We implement it using a single-layer LSTM model. Once having constructed all edges for each layer, we can immediately obtain the set of neighbors N(en i) for each node ei in the n-th layer. Self-attention operations with multi-head mechanism are then performed on its neighbors for each node. For text tasks, we regard each token as a node. For graph-like structures, we treat nodes in the original graph as nodes. For images, the input (H,W,F in) dimensional sensor is reshaped to a HW ×Fin matrix, where each row can be thought as a node by our deﬁnition. 4.2 Distance Encoding The input graph intrinsically displays some degree of structures. For example, in a sequence of natural language tokens, the relative distance between two tokens in the sequence or the corresponding parse 3𝑒𝑖 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 i really like cats Edge  Predictor 𝑒𝑖 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 Self- Attention Self- Attention (a) (b) e1 e3 e3 e2 e2 e4 Distance Encodings 𝐠6 ×( )+ Node Encodings 𝐰1,𝐰2,𝐰3,𝐰4 𝐯2,𝐯0,𝐯1,𝐯-1 layer 𝑛 Figure 1: An illustration of the proposed Sparse Apdative Connection.

(b) shows the edge prediction process of (a) with distance encodings. When predicting time-step 6, the word embeddings are added with distance encodings. tree encodes structural information. As another example, in the task of node representation learning in graphs (Yang et al., 2016b; Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018), the graph originally comes with the node edges. The LSTM edge predictor described above ignores this structure. To leverage original structural information, we propose distance encodings to incorporate graph structure into the edge predictor. Distance encodings only affect the destination node predictions. In contrast to only using node embedding matrix W, we add an extra distance matrix V that encodes distance information to the original projection matrix W, giving V + W. Each column in V is its corresponding distance representation to the current original node. For example in Figure 1, at time-step 6, when two edges (e1,e3),(e3,e2), and one origin node e2 have been generated, we are to use g5 ∈Rd, the output of the LSTM model at time-step 5, to predict the node at time-step 6. According to the original structure, the distance between e2 (the current origin node) and all the nodes e1,e2,e3,e4 by far are 2, 0, 1, and -1 respectively, where -1 means inability to reach. The distance vectors are thus v2,v0,v1,v−1, which are vectors of size Rd to be learned. Intuitively, this process also discourages generating duplicate edges and leverages the original structural information. In contrast to Veliˇckovi´c et al. (2017) where attention operations are only performed between nodes with literal edges in the original graph, SAC offers the ﬂexibility in leveraging the original graph structure and inﬂuence from the training signals. Additionally, SAC allows for more convenient information exchange between similar nodes that are far away in terms of distance in the original graph structure, which is because the connection construction stage has the ability to connect any pair nodes in the graph. This ability potentially leads to better performances. 4.3 Training and Test Directly training the edge predictor is impractical since we have no access to the ground-truth edges. We use REINFORCE, which is an instance of a broader class of policy gradient methods for optimization. The main idea is to use reinforcement learning to discover the best edge connections for self-attention operations. Each action ais the node predicted by edge predictor. Let Θ denote parameters of the edge predictor and Φ denote the parameters of the main network which maps an input to its ﬁnal label based on a pre-deﬁned self-attention structure. Under the framework of reinforcement learning, we ask the edge predictor to maximize its reward R(Θ), which is the log probability of predicting the correct label, e.g., for neural machine translation the reward Ris the average log probability of golden target tokens; for image classiﬁcation, the reward the log probability of the correct label. Consider the simple case where different attention layers use the same node connections, by sampling a sequence of nodes from the edge predictor, we are able to update the parameters in edge predictor using policy gradients: ∇J(Θ) = 2αN∑ i=1 ∇log p(ai|a1:i−1; Θ)(R(Θ) −b) (4) 4layer 𝑛 layer 𝑛 −1 Vanilla Self-attention Transformer-XL Seg-Length=2 BT-Transformer layer 𝑛 +1 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 Adaptive Span S=2 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 Figure 2: Connection of SAC to other methods for computing self-attention. where bdenotes the baseline which is the average of the previous rewards. Φ is updated directly based on the log-likelihood. At test time, edges are decoded using beam search. We use a beam size of 5 for all models. 4.4 Variants of Edge Predictor The vanilla version of the Edge Predictor can be further regulated, simpliﬁed or expanded with prior knowledge for preferable graph structures. All layers sharing the same structure To reduce the computational cost and RL search space, we can enforce the edge structure to be the same for all layers, where the process is only executed once instead of Ltimes. We adopt this strategy for all settings to reduce the search space. All nodes connected in each layer To enforce each node to be connected in each layer, for each node ei, it is repeatedly fed to the predictor αtimes as the original node, and we only predict the destination node. The graph can be either directed graph or undirected graph, depending on how we want self-attention to be computed. Different heads attending to different contexts (head adaptive for short) Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) shows that it is beneﬁcial if different heads attend to different spans (some focusing on the recent history, while others focusing the whole available context). We can also augment the model by assigning each head with a edge predictor, providing the ﬂexibility that different heads can attend to different chunks of context. We sequentially predict all input and output nodes for each head, and the prediction of 2αN nodes are repeated Htimes. In this way, the prediction model for the current head is aware of the information of all previous heads. A head speciﬁc embedding is appended to the node embedding in LSTMs to let the model be aware of the current head. Since this strategy signiﬁcantly increases the search space in RL, we empirically ﬁnd that it helps some settings, but not always. 4.5 Connection to Existing Methods In this subsection, we describe the connection between SAC and previous variants of self-attentions, and show that these variants computing self-attention can be obtained through SAC if we slightly modify the edge predictor. For ease of exposition, we use EP(e) ={(ei,ej)}to denote the collection of all edges for self-attention operations. Connection to vanilla self-attention (Vaswani et al., 2017) The vanilla self-attention links each pair of nodes, where EP(e) can be described as EP(e) ={(ei,ej)|i∈[1,N]}. Connection to Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) Transformer-XL treats the text in a segment- by-segment style. Self-attention operations are performed between nodes within the same segment. EP(e) can be described as EP(e) ={(ei,ej)|i∈[1,N]; j ∈Segment(i)}. Connection to Adaptive Span Transformer (Sukhbaatar et al., 2019) Adaptive Span Trans- former learns an optimal attention span for each head. Suppose the span size assigned to head tis s, then EP(e,t) can be described by: EP(e)={(ei,ej)|i∈[1,N]; j = i,i −1,··· ,i −s+ 1;span = t}. Connection to BP-Transformer (Ye et al., 2019) BP-Transformer constructed a tree-like graph by adding span nodes apart from token nodes. There are 2N −1 nodes in total, where N is the sequence length. In BP-Transformer, each token (leaf) node attends to each span (non-leaf) node that includes it, which we refer to as Ancestor(ei) for node ei. It is easy to prove that a leaf node is 5Model H B edges dev test test (heads) (blocks) (BLEU) (BLEU) (cased sacreBLEU) Transformer Base (Vaswani et al., 2017) 8 6 N2 25.8 27.3 BP base (Ye et al., 2019) 28.1 27.6 Reversible base (Kitaev et al., 2020) 28.0 27.4 SAC base 8 6 2 N 17.4 18.3 17.8 SAC base 8 6 5 N 25.6 27.0 26.2 SAC base 8 6 10 N 26.0 27.7 27.0 SAC base 8 6 15 N 25.6 27.4 26.8 SAC base 16 6 10 N 26.2 28.1 27.6 SAC base 16 12 10 N 26.4 28.4 27.8 Transformer big (Vaswani et al., 2017) 16 6 N2 26.4 28.4 Reversible big (Kitaev et al., 2020) 29.1 28.4 SAC Large 16 6 10 N 26.7 28.9 28.1 SAC Large 16 18 10 N 26.9 29.4 28.6 SAC Large (dependency) 16 18 10 N 26.9 29.5 28.8 Table 1: BLEU scores on the newstest2013 for development and newstest2014 for test for WMT English-German. N denotes the length of the input sequence. associated with ⌊log2 N⌋non-leaf nodes (and thus attends to ⌊log2 N⌋nodes). Therefore, we have EP(e)={(ei,ej)|i∈[1,N]; j ∈Ancestor(ei)}. 5 Experiments 5.1 Machine Translation We use the encoder-decoder model (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Vaswani et al., 2017) as the backbone for machine translation. For the encoder, SAC constructs αN edges for each layer and self-attention operations are performed between connected nodes. For the decoder, masked attention (Vaswani et al., 2017) is applied. Speciﬁcally, given a newly generated target node, it can attend to all source nodes, dummy nodes, target nodes that come beforehand, but not target nodes that come afterwards. We again use SAC to construct edges between the newly generated node and the preceding nodes, where the input node to the edge predictor is forced to be the newly generated node, and the output node is limited to preceding nodes and the dummy nodes. Following Vaswani et al. (2017); Ott et al. (2018); Kitaev et al. (2020), we used the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset to test the proposed model. The dataset consists of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences are encoded using BPE (Sennrich et al., 2016), which has a shared source target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For fair comparison, we used the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ= 10−9 for all models. Label smoothing (Szegedy et al., 2016) with ϵ= 0.1 is applied for all models. For the base setup, following Vaswani et al. (2017), the dimensionality of inputs and outputs dmodel is set to 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality dff is set to 2,048. For big models, dmodel is set to 1,024 and dff is set to 4,096. Models are run on 8 NVIDIA V100 GPUs. Results are shown in Table 1. As we gradually increase the number of edges for each layer (from 2 to 5 to 10 to 15 per node), we can see that the performance ﬁrst increases, reaching the highest with αset to 10, and then decreases. This means that performing attention operations between all pairs is not only unnecessary, but can hurt the performance. Memory saved from sparse connections allow for more heads to perform attentions and deeper networks with more blocks, leading to better performances over vanilla transformers. We also implement a dependency-based model, in which English sources were ﬁrst parsed using Stanford Dependency parser (Chen and Manning, 2014). Relative positions between nodes in the dependency trees are encoded in distance encodings of the edge predictor. The introduction of dependency parser for attention construction introduces +0.14 BLEU score boost. We did not observe signiﬁcant performance boost from the head-adaptive strategy, and thus omit their performances. 6Method Enwiki8 Text8 Params Trans (Al-Rfou et al., 2019) 1.11 1.18 44M Trans-XL (Dai et al., 2019) 1.06 - 41M Adaptive(Sukhbaatar et al., 2019) 1.02 1.11 39M BPT (Ye et al., 2019) 1.02 1.11 38M SAC (basic) 1.02 1.07 39M SAC (head adaptive) 1.00 1.06 39M Table 2: Performances on language modeling datasets. 5.2 Language Modeling We use character-level language modeling datasets to evaluate SAC’s ability to handle long-term dependencies. We use Enwiki8 (Mahoney, 2011) and Text8 (Mahoney, 2011) for evaluation and report the values of BPC for different models. We use the Transformer decoder architecture as the backbone. We compare SAC with other variations of transformers to ﬁt long sequences into the model, including the vanilla Transformer (Al-Rfou et al., 2019), which splits the whole sequence into smaller segments, and only trains the model within each segment and ignore the rest; Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) that adopts a recurrence mechanism to cache the memory of previous segments; adaptive span model (Sukhbaatar et al., 2019) that assigns different heads with different text spans in an adaptive fashion; and the BP-Transformer (Ye et al., 2019) that splits the sequence using binary trees. For SAC, αis set to 256 for each node. The relatively small memory cost allows the model to look at a maximum context of 50k characters. Input dimensionality is set to 512, and the inner-layer dimensionality 2,048. Following (Sukhbaatar et al., 2019), we use Adagrad for optimization, with a batch size of 64 and ﬁxed learning rate of 0.07 and 32k warm-up steps. Results are shown in Table2. As can be seen, SAC-basic outperforms the other Transformers by 0.04 bcp on Text8 while signiﬁcantly reducing the memory usage for large attention spans. For Enwiki8, it ties with the best BPT model, achieving 1.02 bcp score. The improvement validates the importance modeling long-term dependencies with limited available memory. We also ﬁnd that, in the language modeling tasks, the head-adaptive strategy helps, 5.3 Representation Learning in Graphs We test the performance of the proposed model on both transductive and inductive benchmark datasets. For the transductive setup, we used the three standard citation network benchmarks, Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed (Sen et al., 2008). In the transductive setup, we used the Protein-protein interaction dataset (PPI) (Zitnik and Leskovec, 2017). The training algorithm has access to all of the nodes’ feature vectors and labels, and predictions are performed on the test nodes. The detailed descriptions for Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed and PPI are found in the Appendix due to the space limit. The difference between SAC and (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2017) is that the latter performs self-attention operations between nodes that are connected though graph edges, while SAC perform self-attention operations between nodes linked by the edge predictor. For fast convergence, we initialize SAC using the pretrained attention model (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2017), where attention links are just edges in the original graph. Then we start exploring edge construction across all nodes. the number of attention heads is ﬁxed to 8 and the number of blocks is set to 12. We experiment different values of α, i.e, [5, 10, 50, 100] unless the memory usage reaches limitation. We train all models with Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) and early stopping on the validation set. The initial learning rate is treated as a hyper-parameter trained on the validation set. Following (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2017), we run 100 epochs in total and use an early stopping strategy on the both the cross-entropy loss and accuracy for transductive tasks and micro-F1 for inductive tasks. Each experiment is repeated three times and we report the mean value. Results are shown in Table 3. We note that SAC achieves signiﬁcant performance boosts over existing methods across all four datasets, i.e., outperforms our implemented GAT +1.8, +1.1, +0.7 and +1.1 respectively on Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed and PPI. The explanation for SAC’s advantage is as follows: graph node representation learning concerns about both label propagation and relatedness between nearby nodes in the vector space, the latter of which is what GCN handles.

The attention edge prediction stage in SAC fosters information exchange between nodes that are not directly linked in graph but similar in terms of label propagation. SAC actually offers the probability in bridging the aspects, leading to better performances. 5.4 Image Classiﬁcation Augmenting convolution models with self-attention (Bello et al., 2019; Parmar et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019) provides the model with the ability to capture global contexts in an image and has yielded gains in several vision tasks such as image classiﬁcation and objective detection. We follow the protocols in (Bello et al., 2019), i.e. incorporating relative position embeddings for self-attention operations and augmenting each ResNet (Zagoruyko and Komodakis, 2016; He et al., 2016) block with self-attentions. To handle the prohibitive memory cost, (Bello et al., 2019) performs self-attention operations starting from the last layer, which has the smallest spatial dimension, until memory constraints are hit. This ad-hoc strategy is replaced by SAC. Following (Bello et al., 2019), we conduct experiments on CIFAR-100 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009) and ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009). For CIFAR-100, we use the Wide-ResNet-28-10, the architecture of which comprises 3 stages of 4 residual blocks each using two 3×3 convolutions. We augment each convolution of all residual blocks with the number of attention heads set to 16. For ImageNet, we use ResNet-50, the block of which consists of 1×1, 3×3, 1×1 convolutions where the last pointwise convolution expands the number of ﬁlters and the ﬁrst one contracts the number of ﬁlters. We tune αin range {5,10,20}. Results are shown in Table 4. As can be seen, the proposed SAC model signiﬁcantly outperforms the attention model in (Bello et al., 2019) with the only modiﬁcation of automatic edge construction. Speciﬁcally, the top-1 score increases from 81.6 to 82.4 for CIFAR-100 and from 77.7 to 78.7 for ImageNet. The improvement validates the importance of performing necessary attention operations under memory limit. 86 Conclusion In this work, we propose Sparse Adaptive Connection — a sparse connection method to accelerate and structure the self-attention mechanism that adapts to various downstream tasks. We use an LSTM edge predictor to construct edges for self-attention operations, which gives us control of how sparse we want self-attention to be by setting the sparse coefﬁcient α. We demonstrate that SAC is competitive with state-of-the-art models on neural machine translation, language modeling, graph classiﬁcation and image classiﬁcation, while reducing memory costs. Broader Impact Accelerating fully-connected self-attention has been a research trend in recent years. Vanilla self- attention models, such as Transformers and BERT, are not able to process extremely long text, where text must be in advance segmented into pieces and then can be individually modelled. The lack of adequate context leads to poor performances in generating long, coherent and ﬂuent text. The goal of our proposed method, SAC, is to provide a way of relieving the computation burden of vanilla self-attention by automatically searching for the best attention patterns. We believe SAC has great potentials to generate high-quality long text. While there is risk of abuse, like generating fake news, the value of SAC is generally safe and weighs more than abuse to the whole society.

Bioinformatics, 33(14):i190–i198. 12A Graph Datasets For the transductive setup, we used the three standard citation network benchmarks, Cora, Cite- seer and Pubmed (Sen et al., 2008). We followed the transductive setup adopted in (Yang et al., 2016b; Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018), where nodes correspond to documents and edges to (undirected) citations. Cora contains 2708 nodes, 5429 edges, 7 classes and 1433 features per node. Citeseer contains 3327 nodes, 4732 edges, 6 classes and 3703 features per node. Pubmed contains 19717 nodes, 44338 edges, 3 classes and 500 features per node. For the inductive setup, we used the Protein-protein interaction dataset (PPI) (Zitnik and Leskovec, 2017), which aims at classifying protein roles such as cellular functions and gene ontology in various protein-protein interaction (PPI) graphs, where each graph corresponds to a different human tissue. Critically, testing graphs remain completely unobserved during training. The dataset has 56.9K nodes, 806.2 edges with 121 classes. The average number of nodes per graph is 2372. Each node has 50 features that are composed of positional gene sets, motif gene sets and immunological signatures. There are 121 labels for each node set from gene ontology, collected from the Molecular Signatures Database (Liberzon et al., 2011), and a node can have several labels simultaneously. 13barack obama is an american politician and attorney who served as the 44th president of the united states from 2009 to 2017 . a member of the democratic party , he was the first african-american president of the united states . he previously served as a u.s. senator from illinois from 2005 to 2008 and an illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004 . barack obama is an american politician and attorney who served as the 44th president of the united states from 2009 to 2017 . a member of the democratic party , he was the first african-american president of the united states . he previously served as a u.s. senator from illinois from 2005 to 2008 and an illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004 . 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Figure 3: Predicted self-attention links for the text barack obama is an american politician and attorney who served as the 44th president of the president of the united states from 2009 to 2017. as a member of the democratic party, he was the ﬁrst african-american president of the united states. he previously served as a u.s. senator from illinois from 2005 to 2008 and an illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004. 14",

SAC learns to construct sparse, adaptive attention edges for specific tasks by treating the input as a graph and performing attention operations only between linked nodes. This approach significantly reduces computational cost and memory usage, effectively handles long input sequences, and achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models across various tasks, while also demonstrating that many existing self-attention variants are special cases of SAC.",
        "methodology": "SAC replaces the fully-connected self-attention structure with a sparse, graph-like structure where attention is only performed between learned connections. An LSTM Edge Predictor dynamically constructs these edges, decoupling edge prediction into original and destination node pairs, with a hyperparameter α controlling the average number of edges per node. To incorporate existing structural information, a Distance Encoding mechanism adds a learned distance matrix to the node embedding projection. The Edge Predictor is trained using REINFORCE, a policy gradient reinforcement learning method, to maximize a task-specific reward (e.g., log probability of correct label). At test time, edges are decoded using beam search. Variants include sharing the same edge structure across all layers (adopted by default), connecting all nodes in each layer by predicting only destination nodes, and head-adaptive connections where different attention heads have their own edge predictors.",

For **Neural Machine Translation**, an encoder-decoder Transformer backbone was used on the WMT 2014 English-German dataset (4.5M pairs, 37k BPE vocabulary), with Adam optimizer, label smoothing, and dmodel=512/1024, dff=2048/4096. α was varied (2, 5, 10, 15 edges/node), and a dependency-parsed variant was explored. **Language Modeling** used character-level Enwiki8 and Text8 datasets with a Transformer decoder. α was set to 256, context 50k chars, dmodel=512, dff=2048, and Adagrad optimizer. **Graph Representation Learning** involved transductive (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed) and inductive (PPI) setups. SAC was initialized with a pretrained GAT model, using 8 heads, 12 blocks, and α in [5, 10, 50, 100], optimized with Adam and early stopping. **Image Classification** augmented Wide-ResNet-28-10 on CIFAR-100 (16 attention heads) and ResNet-50 on ImageNet with SAC, tuning α in {5, 10, 20}.

        "limitations": "The optimal sparsity coefficient (α) needs to be tuned for each specific task, indicating a dependency on task-specific hyperparameter selection. The head-adaptive strategy, which allows different heads to attend to different contexts, significantly increases the search space for the reinforcement learning optimization and did not consistently provide significant performance boosts across all evaluated tasks. The reliance on reinforcement learning (REINFORCE) for training the edge predictor, while necessary due to the lack of ground-truth edges, can be computationally expensive and potentially suffer from high variance inherent to policy gradient methods.",

The key component of these networks is the self-attention layer [ 1, 18], which updates the embeddings of the input tokens based on their context. Naturally, the self-attention layer also plays the key role in the analysis of Transformers [3, 4, 12, 20, 33]; for example, Yun et al. [33] show that Transformers can approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence functions (i.e., universal approximation), by proving that self-attention layers can compute contextual mappings of the input embeddings. On the other hand, the self-attention layer is also the main bottleneck in scaling these models. It involves computation of pairwise inner products between input tokens, which results in quadratic computational complexity O(n2) in the length of the input sequence n. To mitigate this issue, researchers have developed methods to sparsify the pairwise interactions/connections in self-attention layers to reduce the computational complexity and/or improve model interpretability, and have shown successful empirical results on tasks with long sequence lengths [ 2, 6, 8, 9, 11, 16, 22, 25, 26, 32, 34, 35]. For example, Child et al. [6] propose sparse Transformers for sequence generation. One of the sparsity patterns considered in [6] is the STRIDED pattern, where the sparse attention layers alternate between two patterns: each token attends to only i) wlocal neighbors, and then ii) one after 34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020), Vancouver, Canada. arXiv:2006.04862v2  [cs.LG]  19 Dec 2020every wtokens in a strided manner. By choosing w= O(√n), they propose sparse attention layers with O(n3/2) connections and show improvements on both speed and performance over the dense Transformer. In the existing results, the rule of thumb for designing sparsity patterns (e.g.,STRIDED ) is connectivity; the intuition is that if each token can attend to the other tokens in multiple “hops,” then the resulting sparse Transformers do not lose much expressive power. However, there has been no formal justiﬁcation for this intuition. How does sparsifying the interaction in the self-attention layers affect the model’s expressive power and ability to learn? What are the sparsity levels at which the model still retains its rich expressive power, and how is it affected by the sparsity pattern? Such fundamental questions about sparse attention models still remain unanswered. 1.1 Summary of contributions In this paper, we take the ﬁrst step towards a theoretical understanding of sparse Transformers. • We propose a uniﬁed framework to analyze sparse Transformers, which generalizes the existing approaches that sparsify attention layers (§ 3.1). • We propose a set of intuitive conditions on the sparsity pattern (Assumption 1) and the probability map (Assumption 2). Then, in Theorem 1, we show that Sparse Transformers, of ﬁxed width and arbitrary depth, satisfying these conditions are universal approximators of any continuous sequence-to-sequence functions for any given ﬁxed sequence length (§ 3.2 and § 3.3). • We next show some examples of existing sparse Transformers [2, 6, 8, 9, 11, 34, 35] that satisfy these conditions, and hence have universal approximability (§ 3.4). Surprisingly, we show that there are sparse Transformers with only O(n) connections per self-attention layer (instead of n2) that have enough expressive power to approximate arbitrary continuous functions (Corollary 2). • We report experimental results on standard NLP tasks using sparse Transformers, comparing different sparsity patterns/levels (§ 5). 2 Preliminaries and related works In this section, we summarize the notation we will use throughout the paper, give a brief overview of Transformers, and then discuss existing efforts to sparsify the self-attention mechanism. 2.1 Notation For a positive integer a, we denote [a] = {1,2,...,a }. For any vector v ∈Rd, let vj denote its j-th coordinate. For any matrix A ∈Rd×n, let Aj denote its j-th column, and ASdenote the submatrix consisting of columns of A in an index set S⊆ [n]. We use ∥A∥p to denote the entry-wise ℓp norm of A. Let σS[·] be the softmax operator, which takes a matrix as input and applies softmax operation to each column of the matrix, which results in a column stochastic matrix. 2.2 Transformers and their universal approximation power A Transformer network, consisting of multiple layers of Transformer blocks, implements a sequence- to-sequence function that maps Rd×n to Rd×n. A Transformer Block (TB) consists of two layers: a self-attention layer and a token-wise feed-forward layer, and both layers have an identity skip connection. More concretely, for an input X ∈Rd×n consisting of d-dimensional embeddings of n tokens, a Transformer block consists of the following two layers: Attn(X) = X + WO   Head1(X) ... Headh(X)  ; Head i(X) = Wi VX ·σS[(Wi KX)TWi QX] (1a) TB(X) = Attn(X) + W2 ·ReLU(W1 ·Attn(X)), (1b) where WO ∈Rd×mh, Wi V,Wi K,Wi Q ∈Rm×d, W2 ∈Rd×r,and W1 ∈Rr×d. Although our analysis and experiments rely on bias vectors, we omit those in (1) for simplicity. To endow the network with information about the position of input tokens, it is common to add a positional embedding E ∈Rd×n to the input X before feeding it to the network. The positional 2embedding E can be ﬁxed [28] or trainable [10]; we consider the latter. Using a trainable E, Th,m,r is deﬁned to be a class of functions of the form X ↦→t(X + E), where tis a composition of any number of Transformer blocks with hattention heads of head size m, and hidden layers of width r. Thus, Th,m,r is a class of Transformers with a ﬁxed width while the depth can be arbitrary. Further, let Fbe the class of continuous functions f : D →Rd×n deﬁned on any compact domain D ⊂Rd×n, where continuity is deﬁned with respect to the entry-wise ℓp norm (1 ≤p <∞). Yun et al. [33, Theorem 3] show that T2,1,4 can universally approximate F. More precisely, for any f ∈F , ϵ >0 and 1 ≤p <∞, there exists a function g ∈T 2,1,4 such that dp(f,g) := ( ∫ D ∥f(X) −g(X)∥p pdX)1/p ≤ϵ. Our goal in this paper is to study, in a similar manner, the expressive power of sparse Transformers. 2.3 Sparse Transformers As seen in Eq. (1a), the self-attention layer involves computing the inner product between each pair of tokens, which we will refer to as theattention score matrix Ai := (Wi KX)TWi QX ∈Rn×n. This leads to quadratic computational complexity in n, which makes it expensive to apply Transformers to tasks with long sequence lengths. One popular approach to mitigate this problem is to sparsify the self-attention layers. We sub-classify sparse Transformers into three categories and summarize them below. For a more extensive summary, please see a recent survey [27]. The ﬁrst category reduces computation by making Ai sparse in a pre-determined manner. Each token in the sequence only attends to a ﬁxed smaller set of other tokens instead of the whole sequence [2, 6, 22]. In some papers, auxiliary tokens are added to improve connectivity between existing tokens while maintaining sparsity [11, 32]. One drawback of these approaches is that the sparsity pattern is independent of input, so it cannot adapt to the data. To remedy this issue, [26] proposes to learn local attention span from data. In a concurrent paper, Zaheer et al. [34] propose the BIGBIRD sparsity pattern which falls into this category. For BIGBIRD , the authors show its theoretical properties such as universal approximation and Turing completeness, as well as its superior empirical performance. We note that our paper focuses on universal approximation for abroader class of sparse Transformers, by proposing a unifying framework to analyze them. The second category studies making Ai sparse after the full Ai has been computed [8, 9, 35]. Here, the focus is not on the computational gain via sparsity, because the full score matrix Ai has to be computed ﬁrst; rather, the goal here is to make attention layers more interpretable, as well as to improve performance. This line of works modiﬁes σS in (1a) to other probability maps, by using top-kelements or adopting sparser variants such as sparselin-gen or α-entmax [15, 21]. Compared to the ﬁrst category, this approach has an advantage that sparsity patterns are adaptive to data. The last category attempts to get the best of both worlds. This line of works tries to learn sparsity patterns from data using extra components predicting the connection between tokens, e.g., k-means clustering [25], LSTM [16], or locality-sensitive hashing [14]. This way, one can adaptively determine the sparsity patterns before computing the score matrix. However, the drawback of this approach is that one needs extra computation to train/run these additional components, which may be expensive. 3 Universal approximation theorem for sparse Transformers In this section, we derive a unifying framework to study sparse Transformers. We then propose a set of conditions on the sparse self-attention layers, and prove that the sparse Transformers satisfying theses conditions are universal approximators of any continuous sequence-to-sequence functions. Finally, we show some examples of existing sparse Transformers that satisfy these conditions. 3.1 A unifying framework for sparse Transformers We modify the Transformer block in (1) to the following sparse Transformer block (STB): SAttnl(X) = X + WO   SHead1,l(X) ... SHeadh,l(X)  , SHeadi,l(X)k = Wi VXAl k ·ρ[(Wi KXAl k )TWi QXk] STBl(X) = SAttnl(X) + W2 ·ReLU(W1 ·SAttnl(X)), (2) 3where the sets Al k ⊆[n], for k ∈[n] and l ∈[p], deﬁne the psparsity patterns (formally deﬁned below), which are indexed by l∈[p]. Moreover, the parameter dimensions stay the same as in (1). Note that there are three main modiﬁcations from the dense Transformer. • (Cycling blocks) There are superscripts l ∈[p] added to the symbols such as SAttn. Unlike dense Transformers, some sparse Transformers cycle through pdifferent patterns. For example, the STRIDED pattern [6] described in § 1 alternates between two different patterns, which corresponds to p= 2. We add the superscript lto include such cases in our formulation. We assume that the layers in a sparse Transformer cycle through STB1,..., STBp. • (Sparsity patterns) Note that SHeadi,l(X)k denotes the k-th column of the i-th sparse attention head. Unlike dense Transformers, the inner product of the k-th query vector Wi QXk is taken only with Wi KXAl k , the key vectors of tokens in the set Al k ⊆[n]. Hence, instead of all n tokens, the k-th token computes attention scores with only tokens in Al k. For l∈[p], we refer to the collection of the index sets {Al k}k∈[n], or simply {Al k}, as a sparsity pattern. As a result, SHeadi,l(X)k is a linear combination of columns in Wi VXAl k , rather than the whole sequence. • (Probability map) After computing the attention score matrix, the dense Transformer (1) uses the softmax operator σS to get a column stochastic matrix. In the sparse Transformers, we generalize σS to ρ. The probability map ρis any map that takes a matrix as input and outputs a column stochastic matrix. As a sanity check, by choosing p = 1 , A1 k = [ n] for all k ∈[n], and ρ = σS, we recover the dense Transformer (1). Note also that the sparse Transformer formulation covers the ﬁrst and second categories of existing results discussed in § 2.3. The ﬁrst category corresponds to choosing a predetermined sparsity pattern(s) {Al k}, while setting ρ= σS. The second category corresponds to opting for a probability map ρother than softmax σS, while maintaining A1 k = [n] for all k∈[n]. In this paper, we assume for simplicity that all sparse attention heads SHead1,l,..., SHeadh,l in a single layer have identical sparsity patterns {Al k}. However, since our result only requires two sparse attention heads per layer (as we will see in Theorem 1), our result can be easily extended to the case that allows multiple sparsity patterns in a single layer. Similar to Th,m,r in § 2.2, we deﬁne the class of functions represented by sparse Transformers. We hide the dependence of this class on the sparsity patterns and probability map to simplify the notation. STh,m,r := {X ↦→t(X + E) |tis a composition of cycling sparse Transformer blocks STBl, each with hheads of head size mand hidden layer size r, and positional embedding E ∈Rd×n is trainable}. (3) 3.2 Conditions on sparsity patterns and probability map In this section, we deﬁne a set of conditions on the sparsity patterns {Al k}and the probability map ρ that ensures that the sparse Transformer universally approximate the function class F(cf. § 2.2). For k∈[n] and the index sets {Al k}l∈[p], we deﬁne a sequence of sets {St k}t≥1 in a recursive way: S1 k := A1 k, St k := ⋃ j∈A(t−1) mod p+1 k St−1 j . The set St k is the set of all tokens that the k-th token can directly/indirectly attend to, after tsparse attention layers with sparsity patterns cycling through {A1 k},{A2 k},..., {Ap k}. We now state our conditions on sparsity patterns. Assumption 1. The sparsity patterns {Al k}satisfy the following: 1. For all k∈[n] and l∈[p], we have k∈Al k. 2. There exists a permutation γ : [n] →[n] such that, for all i∈[n−1], γ(i) ∈⋃p l=1 Al γ(i+1). 3. There exists a ﬁnite s∈N such that s= min{u|Su k = [n] for all k∈[n]}. 4Assumption 1.1 is equivalent to saying that every token always attends to itself. Assumption 1.2 re- quires that there is a chain ofdirect connections that covers allntokens; note that the set⋃p l=1 Al γ(i+1) is the set of all tokens that the γ(i+ 1)-th token directly attends to. To elaborate more about the chain, consider a directed graph with nvertices corresponding to the ntokens. For any j ∈⋃p l=1 Al k, we add a directed edge j →k. Given a graph constructed this way, Assumption 1.2 requires that the graph has a Hamiltonian path γ(1) →γ(2) →···→ γ(n). Assumption 1.3 requires that after s sparse attention layers, every token can attend to all the other tokens, either directly or indirectly. As we discuss in § 3.4, the statements in Assumption 1 are natural enough to be satisﬁed by many existing sparsity patterns studied in the literature. In fact, Assumption 1.3 is necessary for universal approximation. If p= 1, n= 2, A1 1 = {1}and A1 2 = {1,2}, then the ﬁrst token never attends to the second, so this sparse Transformer cannot approximate a function whose ﬁrst output token is dependent on both input tokens. The other two assumptions are required in parts of our proof, which involve “propagating information” over all the tokens in a sequential manner. We now state the assumption on the probability map ρ[·]. For this, we deﬁne σH[·] to be the hardmax operator, which outputs the one-hot representation of the arg max entry for each column of the input matrix. Since ρis a column-wise operator that outputs a column-stochastic matrix, we state the assumption for the operation of ρon a single column. Assumption 2. For any ζ >0 and η∈(0,1], ∃t> 0 such that, for any column input v satisfying vj∗−maxj̸=j∗vj ≥ζ(where j∗= arg maxjvj), we have ρ[tv]j∗ ≥1 −ηand ∑ j̸=j∗ρ[tv]j ≤η. Assumption 2 requires that, for inputs that have some margin between the unique maximum entry and the other entries, ρ[·] can closely approximate the behavior of the hardmax operator by scaling its input by a positive factor t. This assumption is satisﬁed by softmax σS and other sparse variants such as sparselin-gen and α-entmax, as we show in § B of the supplementary material. It is straightforward to check that the dense Transformer, which corresponds to p= 1, A1 k = [n], and ρ[·] = σS[·] in our framework, satisﬁes both Assumptions 1 and 2. 3.3 Sparse Transformers are universal approximators The key justifying intuition for adopting sparse attention layers is that, if each token can attend to the other tokens in multiple hops1, then these models do not lose too much expressive power. However, turning this intuition into a rigorous analysis is not straightforward. Moreover, recent results show that limited width can render universal approximation impossible even with arbitrary depth [13, 19], highlighting the challenges in analyzing sparse (limited “width”) Transformers. We now state our main theorem, which shows that if the sparsity patterns{Al k}and the probability map ρsatisfy Assumptions 1 and 2, sparse Transformers with h= 2 attention heads of size m= 1, and hidden layer width r = 4 are universal approximators of continuous sequence-to-sequence functions on any compact domain (recall that Fdenotes the class of such continuous functions). Theorem 1. Consider any f ∈F , and the class of sparse Transformers ST2,1,4 (cf. (3)) with the underlying sparse attention layers satisfying Assumptions 1 and 2. Then, for any ϵ >0 and 1 ≤p< ∞, there exists a function g∈ST 2,1,4 such that dp(f,g) := (∫ D ∥f(X) −g(X)∥p pdX )1/p ≤ϵ. As discussed earlier, dense Transformers satisfy Assumptions 1 and 2, which means that Theorem 1 subsumes the existing result [33] for dense Transformers. We note that the required h, m, and rin Theorem 1 are independent of d, n, or the sparsity patterns. We provide a high-level proof sketch of Theorem 1 in § 4.1. There, we also discuss how many layers are sufﬁcient for ϵ-approximation of f, and show that Theorem 1 requires only ptimes more self-attention layers than Yun et al. [33]. We would like to emphasize that Theorem 1 provides the ﬁrst formal evidence that well-designed sparse attention layers do not limit Transformer’s universal approximation power. In § 3.4, we show a surprising fact that some existing sparse self-attention layers with only O(n) connections (as opposed to n2 in regular self-attention layers) retain enough expressive power to approximate F. Combined with the number of layers analyzed in § 4.1, this means that our analysis reduces the 1Note that this corresponds to our Assumption 1.3. 5connections per layer from n2 to O(n), with only ptimes more attention layers. This advantage of sparse Transformers over their dense counterpart becomes even stronger with increasing sequence length n, providing a theoretical support for the adoption of sparsity for tasks with long sequence lengths. On a ﬁnal note, Theorem 1 views the sequence length nas a ﬁxed constant. Hence, our result does not contradict a recent paper by Hahn [12] which studies the limitation of Transformers for varying n. Also, our analysis applies to the encoder part of the Transformer network [28]. 3.4 Analysis of existing sparse Transformers By Theorem 1, any sparse Transformer that satisﬁes our Assumptions 1 and 2 has universal approxi- mation ability. In this section, we give some examples of such sparse Transformers. Child et al. [6] propose two kinds of 2-step sparsity patterns (i.e., p= 2) for sequence generation tasks, namely STRIDED and FIXED patterns. We consider the extension of their auto-regressive patterns (i.e., attending only to past tokens) to the whole sequence. In the STRIDED pattern, a token ﬁrst attends to its wneighbors and then attends to one token after every wtokens in a strided manner. The sparsity pattern for the k-th token reads A1 k = [n] ∩{k−⌈w/2⌉,...,k −1,k,k + 1,...,k + ⌊w/2⌋}, A2 k = [n] ∩{...,k −2w,k −w,k,k + w,k + 2w,... }. (4) In the FIXED pattern, we divide the token into segments of length w. A token in a segment has access to other tokens in the same segment, and then the last tokens of the other segments: A1 k = [n] ∩{⌈k/w⌉·w−w+ 1,..., ⌈k/w⌉·w}, A2 k = [n] ∩({k}∪{w,2w,3w,... }) . (5) The STRIDED and FIXED patterns satisfy both Assumption 1 and 2 for all values of w. Speciﬁcally, Assumption 1.3 holds with s= 2, because any token can directly/indirectly access all the tokens in two hops. As for Assumption 1.2, the identity permutation γ(i) = isufﬁces to satisfy the assumption for both patterns. By choosing w = O(√n), sparse Transformers with the STRIDED and FIXED patterns achieve universal approximation power with O(n3/2) connections per attention layer. Guo et al. [11] consider the STAR sparsity pattern where they add an auxiliary relay token that attends to all the tokens, and the other tokens attend only to 2w neighboring tokens and the relay token. There is only one sparsity pattern, so p= 1. The S TAR sparsity pattern can be written as A1 k={n}∪ { (i−1) mod (n−1) + 1 |i∈{k−w,...,k + w} } for k∈[n−1], A1 n=[n], (6) where w≥1. For any ﬁxed w, this sparse Transformer has O(n) connections per attention layer, and it satisﬁes both assumptions. Speciﬁcally, Assumption 1.2 is satisﬁed with the identity permutation, i.e., γ(i) = (i) for i∈[n]. Since any token can access other tokens within two hops, Assumption 1.3 is satisﬁed with s = 2 . This demonstrates that O(n) connections per layer sufﬁce for sparse attention layers to have universal approximation power. One can similarly check that the sliding window sparsity patterns with/without global attention, proposed in Longformer [2], also satisfy the assumptions with O(n) connections. For the BIGBIRD sparsity pattern [34], it is also straightforward to check that a combination of its window attention and global attention satisﬁes Assumption 1 with O(n) connections. We state this interesting observation as a corollary below. Corollary 2. There exist sparse Transformers withO(n) connections per self-attention layer that are universal approximators in the sense of Theorem 1. Recall that another line of results that replaces softmax σS with sparse variants ρ[8, 9, 35] also ﬁts into our formulation, with p = 1 and A1 k = [n]. As we show in § B, these alternative ρ’s satisfy Assumption 2. Thus, by Theorem 1, these models also have the universal approximation property. 4 Proof sketch and discussion 4.1 Sketch of proof of Theorem 1 Now, we sketch the proof of Theorem 1, which consists of three steps. Throughout the proof, we assume without loss of generality that D ⊂[0,1)d×n. Step 1. In the ﬁrst step, we approximate f ∈F with a piecewise constant function. Towards this, consider a class of piecewise constant functionsF(δ) that map D to Rd×n, where δ >0 and δ−1 is an 6integer. Any function in F(δ) maps cubes of the form G+ [0,δ)d×n to matrices AG ∈Rd×n, where G ∈{0,δ,..., 1−δ}d×n. We approximate f with a function f ∈F(δ) such that dp(f,f) ≤ϵ/2, by choosing small enough δ. We defer the statement and the proof to § C of the supplementary material. Step 2. We then approximate f ∈F(δ) with a sparse Transformer network with a slightly modiﬁed architecture. In this architecture, we replace ReLU in the feed-forward layer with any piecewise linear activation φ ∈Φ, where Φ denotes the class of (possibly discontinuous) piecewise linear functions with three pieces. We also replace ρin the sparse attention layer with the hardmax σH operator. We refer to the function class represented by the modiﬁed sparse Transformer as ST h,m,r . By a careful construction, Lemma 3 shows that any f ∈F(δ) can be exactly represented by the modiﬁed Transformer. To this end, we ﬁrst carefully choose the positional embedding E. We then quantize the inputs using feed-forward layers (Lemma 6), construct a contextual mapping using self-attention layers to map the quantized inputs to unique “ids” (Lemma 7), and then construct a value mapping with feed-forward layers to map the ids to desired output values (Lemma 8). See § D and § E in the supplementary material for details. Lemma 3. For any f ∈F(δ), there exists g∈ST 2,1,1 such that f(X) = g(X) for all X ∈D. Step 3. The ﬁnal step is to approximate the function g ∈ ST 2,1,1 with a sparse Transformer g ∈ ST2,1,4. This is done by approximating φ and σH with ReLU and ρ, respectively, while carefully bounding the accumulation of errors introduced by the approximation. See § F in the supplementary material for the details. Lemma 4. For g∈ST 2,1,1 in Lemma 3, there exists g∈ST 2,1,4 such that dp(g,g) ≤ϵ/2. Combining these three steps, we establish that dp(f,g) ≤dp(f,f) + dp(f,g) + dp(g,g) ≤ϵ. How many layers are sufﬁcient? In § D, Lemmas 6–8 show that we need dn δ sparse Transformer blocks (2) for quantization, p(n−1) δd + sfor the contextual mapping, and n δdn for the value mapping. Recall that pis from (2), sis from Assumption 1, and δis from Step 1 above. In comparison, § C of [33] shows that the dense counterpart requires dn δ , n δd + 1, and n δdn Transformer blocks (1) for the three corresponding lemmas. Note two observations: 1) The value mapping dominates the depth, and its depth requirements are identical for the two cases; and 2) For contextual mappings (where the attention layers are used), we need roughly ptimes more layers for sparse models. Recall from § 3.4 that pis usually a small constant. These observations mean that sparse Transformers can achieve universal approximation using depth of the same order in d, nand δas the dense Transformers. 4.2 Key challenges in the proof While the high level outline of the proof is similar to the one for dense Transformers [33], the proof in [33] crucially relies on having all connections for computing attention in each layer, which we do not have in sparse Transformers. The sparsity in attention mechanism and the choice of general probability map ρpose nontrivial challenges in the proof. We highlight the key differences below. Establishing the Step 2 of the dense result [33] relies on constructing a contextual mapping using attention layers. A contextual mapping is a function that maps tokens in different sequences to unique values, thereby allowing Transformers to distinguish the same token appearing in different contexts. A crucial ingredient in the construction of such a mapping is a shift operation implemented with two attention heads in an attention layer. This shift operation involves each token taking the maximum and minimum over the entire sequence, which obviously cannot be done with sparse Transformers as it would require each token to attend to all the other tokens in the sequence. We circumvent this issue by carefully choosing the positional embedding E dependent on γ(cf. Assumption 1.2), and ensuring that a similar shift operation is applied in a desired order even under sparsity. As the ﬁnal phase of the contextual mapping in [33], a single attention layer shifts the entire sequence by the maximum over the sequence. Again, this cannot be directly implemented due to sparsity. Using Assumption 1.3, we instead prove that by stacking ssparse layers, one can successfully implement a similar operation that shifts the entire sequence by the maximum over the whole sequence, up to some controlled errors. This way, we overcome the difﬁculties posed by the sparsity and construct a new version of contextual mappings. The details can be found in § E.2 of the supplementary material. Moreover, the proof of Step 3 in [33] uses the simple fact that softmax can approximate hardmax arbitrarily closely. Since we do not restrict ourselves to softmax and generalize the probability map, 7Table 1: Accuracy on the synthetic copying task. Percentages in parentheses mark the sparsity levels.

Since there are many layers in the network g, it turns out that approximating it with an original sparse Transformer in ST2,1,4 requires carefully controlling the approximation errors accumulated over layers. The proof of Lemma 4 in § F of the supplementary material shows that this is indeed possible by utilizing Assumption 2. 5 Experiments We now present our experimental study comparing different design and implementation choices, including sparsity patterns and levels, on four tasks: i) a synthetic copying task, ii) language modeling, iii) translation, and iv) GLUE tasks. Our goal is to understand the effect of such choices while employing sparse Transformers to the tasks with small sequence lengths, complementing the existing results for sparse Transformers on long sequence tasks. 5.1 Experiment Settings We consider four sparsity patterns: STRIDED (4), FIXED (5), STAR (6) and RANDOM . The ﬁrst three patterns are proposed in [6] and [11]; we test them for different values of w. In case of the RANDOM pattern, given a sparsity level, we make connections uniformly at random. Following [6], STRIDED and FIXED patterns are tested for three different head conﬁgurations: i) SEQUENTIAL , where the sparse attention layers alternate between {A1 k}and {A2 k}, as described in the previous sections; ii) UNION , where all sparse attention layers use the sparsity pattern{A1 k∪A2 k}; and iii) MULTIHEAD , where half of the attention heads in every attention layer use {A1 k}and the other half use {A2 k}. Note that, given the same sequence length, UNION is less sparse than the other two conﬁgurations. Thus, to ensure fair comparisons, we compare different conﬁgurations based on their sparsity levels. We use maximum sequence length 256 in all our experiments, except 128 for GLUE tasks. For the copying task, we experiment with only one sparse Transformer block (cf. Eq (2)), with varying numbers of attention layers with 4 attention heads. For language modeling and translation, we use the Tensor2Tensor [29] framework and employ 12-block and 6-block (respectively) Transformers with 8 attention heads per block. For GLUE tasks, we experiment with the BERTBASE model. For more details of the setup, see § G of the supplementary material. 5.2 Results Copying task. We consider a synthetic copying task proposed in [ 14], where the input sequence has the format 0s0s, where s is a 127 length sequence of symbols in [0,127]. The models have to predict (copy) the second part, given the ﬁrst half of the input. This task tests the ability of sparse Transformers to communicate the information. Table 1 presents the results for this task. Except for the STAR and RANDOM patterns, we can see that the networks learn to copy the sequences with four sparse attention layers. One possible explanation for the bad performance of STAR is that, except for the relay token, it only attends to local neighbors while the task requires to copy distant tokens. Language modeling. We conduct the language modeling experiments on the One Billion Word Benchmark [5] which has almost one billion tokens and a vocabulary of more than 800K unique tokens. In Figure 1a, we plot the perplexity against the sparsity level. We observe that the STRIDED pattern and the STAR achieve the best performance across all sparsity levels. For both the STRIDED and FIXED patterns, the UNION conﬁguration shows the best performance. Translation. For the translation task, we train the model on WMT18 English-Czech (en-cs) dataset and test it on the Newstest 2015 dataset. We plot the BLEU score against the sparsity level in Figure 1b. We apply the same sparsity pattern to both the encoder and the decoder. The STRIDED 8(a) One Billion Benchmark  (b) WMT en-cs Figure 1. Comparison of sparsity patterns and different head conﬁgurations on the One Billion Benchmark (a language modeling task) and WMT en-cs (a translation task).

Comparison of sparsity patterns and different head conﬁgurations on the MNLI and XNLI (sentence-pair classiﬁcation tasks), using the BERTBASE model. and FIXED patterns with UNION conﬁguration show the best scores, which are similar to the dense attention. The U NION conﬁguration is also the least sensitive to the sparsity levels. GLUE Tasks. We experiment with the BERTBASE model and report results on two sentence-pair classiﬁcation tasks: MNLI [30] (Figure 2a) and XNLI [7] (Figure 2b). We plot the average accuracy of three runs on the dev set against the sparsity level. Additional results of the CoLA and MRPC tasks are reported in § H of the supplementary material. Discussion. In all tasks, the RANDOM pattern performs worse than the deterministic patterns, demonstrating the need for a careful design of sparsity patterns. Overall, our experiments suggest that the design of the optimal sparsity patterns is heavily dependent on speciﬁc tasks. For example, the STAR pattern shows the best performance on the language modeling task, while having trouble with copying, translation, and BERT experiments. Among the three head conﬁgurations tested for STRIDED and FIXED , the UNION performs the best in language modeling and translation but suffers in BERT tasks. In translation experiments, we see an interesting trend that the performance of MULTIHEAD conﬁguration improves as sparsity increases. We conjecture that this is due to the fact that in STRIDED and FIXED , we have |A1 k|= O(w) and |A2 k|= O(n/w) (cf. Eqs (4) and (5)), so the sparsest choice of w= O(√n) is the one with the best “balance” between|A1 k|and |A2 k|. 6 Conclusion Recently, sparse Transformers have received a lot of attention as they enable more efﬁcient/faster attention mechanisms for the tasks with very long sequence lengths. We take an initial step to provide a theoretical understanding of these models. We provide a unifying framework that captures existing sparse attention models, and prove a universal approximation theorem for sparse Transformers which holds under intuitive conditions on sparsity patterns and probability maps. We also carry out experiments comparing different sparsity patterns and levels on standard NLP tasks. We hope that this work will shed light on the understanding of sparsity in attention layers, and provide guidance for the design of sparse attention models. 9Broader Impact This work studies theoretical aspects of a class of widely used neural network models in NLP and related areas. Since we do not propose a new method nor a new dataset, we expect that the impact of this work on ethical aspects and future societal consequences will be small, if any. Other than that, this work brings new insights into the sparsity in attention models, hence may make an impact on the study of faster and more efﬁcient NLP models.

First, § B proves that the softmax operator as well as its sparse versions indeed satisfy Assumption 2. Next, § C provides formal statements of Step 1 in the proof sketch (§ 4.1). The outline of proof of Lemma 3 (Step 2 in the proof sketch) is presented in § D, followed by a separate section (§ E) proving the three key sublemmas in the proof. The proof of Step 3, Lemma 4, is given in § F. Lastly, § G and § H present the detailed setup of our experiments and additional experiment results, respectively. We next review some of the notation and also introduce additional notation used throughout the supplementary material. For a positive integer a, let [a] := {1,...,a }. For a,b,c ∈R where b−a> 0 is an integer multiple of c> 0, we write [a: c: b] := {a,a + c,a + 2c,...,b −c,b}. For any matrix A ∈Rd×n, let Aj denote its j-th column, and ASdenote the submatrix consisting of columns of A in the index set S⊆ [n]. We also use Ai,j to denote its (i,j)-th entry. Let 1 {·}be the 0-1 indicator for an event. Let 1n ∈Rn be a vector whose components are all 1. B Sparse probability maps satisfy Assumption 2 In this section, we show that the softmax operatorσS as well as the probability maps ρused to replace softmax in the existing approaches, namely softmax with only top-kinputs [35], sparselin-gen [9], and α-entmax [8], all satisfy Assumption 2. We restate the assumption for reader’s convenience: Assumption 2. For any ζ >0 and η∈(0,1], ∃t> 0 such that, for any column input v satisfying vj∗−maxj̸=j∗vj ≥ζ(where j∗= arg maxjvj), we have ρ[tv]j∗ ≥1 −ηand ∑ j̸=j∗ρ[tv]j ≤η. As in the assumption, we only consider the operation of these probability maps on a single vector, as they are applied column-wise. For each of the probability maps, we will show that for any ζ >0 and η∈(0,1], we can choose t> 0 that satisﬁes the conditions of Assumption 2. B.1 Softmax & softmax with top- kinputs Given an input vector v ∈Rn, the j-th coordinate of the output of softmax σS[v] is deﬁned as σS[v]j := exp(vj)∑n i=1 exp(vi). We assume without loss of generality that the entry ofv is in decreasing order, where the ﬁrst two entries satisfy v1 −v2 ≥ζ. For any such ζ >0 and any 0 <η ≤1, our aim is to show the existence of t> 0 such that σS[tv]1 = exp(tv1)∑n i=1 exp(tvi) ≥1 −η. Then, ∑n j=2 σS[tv]j ≤ηfollows. Now, since vi ≤v1 −ζfor i∈[2 : n], note that σS[tv]1 = exp(tv1)∑n i=1 exp(tvi) ≥ exp(tv1) exp(tv1) + (n−1) exp(tv1 −tζ) = 1 1 + (n−1) exp(−tζ). Since 1 1+(n−1) exp(−tζ) is an increasing function in t >0, one can increase tsufﬁciently large to make it greater than 1 −η. The same argument holds for the softmax with top-kinputs, used in [35]. By the assumption on v, entries v1,...,v k are the top kcomponents. Thus, ρ[tv]1 ≥ 1 1 + (k−1) exp(−tζ) ≥1 −η can be satisﬁed by choosing large enough t> 0. B.2 Sparselin-gen We now consider the case where ρis sparselin-gen [15], which was used to sparsify the attention score matrices in [9]. Given a regularization parameter λ∈[0,1), the sparselin-gen used in [9] is deﬁned as ρ[v] := arg min p∈∆n−1 ∥p −v∥2 −λ∥p∥2 , 13where ∆n−1 := {p ∈Rn |p ≥0,∑n i=1 pi = 1}is the probability simplex. Then, the solution for optimization problem above can be written as ρ[v]j = max { 0,vj −τ(v) 1 −λ } , for j ∈[n], where τ : Rn →R is a threshold function that chooses the threshold τ(v) such that ∑n j=1 ρ[v]j = 1. Now, assume without loss of generality that the entry of v is in decreasing order, where the ﬁrst two entries satisfy v1 −v2 ≥ζ. For any such ζ >0 and any 0 <η ≤1, our aim is to show the existence of t> 0 such that ρ[tv]1 ≥1 −η. This is done by choosing t= 1−η ζ . To see this, notice that if vj’s are in decreasing order, then ρ[v]j are also in decreasing order. Now consider ρ[tv]1 = max { 0,tv1 −τ(tv) 1 −λ } , ρ[tv]2 = max { 0,tv2 −τ(tv) 1 −λ } . If ρ[tv]2 = 0, then ρ[tv]j = 0 for all j = 3,...,n , and ρ[tv]1 = 1 ≥1 −η. If ρ[tv]2 >0, then ρ[tv]1 −ρ[tv]2 = tv1 −τ(tv) 1 −λ −tv2 −τ(tv) 1 −λ = t(v1 −v2) 1 −λ ≥t(v1 −v2) ≥tζ = 1 −η. B.3 α-entmax Next, we consider the case where ρis α-entmax [21], which was used to sparsify the attention score matrices in [8]. Given a parameter α≥1, the α-entmax is deﬁned as ρ[v] := arg max p∈∆n−1 pTv + Hα(v), where ∆n−1 is the probability simplex and Hα is the Tsallis continuous family of entropies Hα(v) := { 1 α(α−1) ∑ jvj −vα j α> 1, −∑ jvjlog vj α= 1. As shown in [8], the solution of α-entmax is equal to softmax if α= 1, and otherwise (α> 1) it is given in the form ρ[v]j = [ max{0,(α−1)vj −τ(v)} ] 1 α−1 , for j ∈[n], where τ : Rn →R is a threshold function that chooses the threshold τ(v) such that ∑n j=1 ρ[v]j = 1. Since softmax (α= 1) is already covered above, we focus on α> 1. Again, assume without loss of generality that the entry of v is in decreasing order, where the ﬁrst two entries satisfy v1 −v2 ≥ζ. For any such ζ >0 and any 0 <η ≤1, our aim is to show the existence of t> 0 such that ρ[tv]1 ≥1 −η. This is done by choosing t= 1/ζ(α−1). Note that (α−1)t(v1 −v2) ≥1 due to our choice of t. Then, we will show that with such a t, ρ[tv]1 = 1 must hold. For the sake of contradiction, suppose not: ρ[tv]1 <1. Then, by monotonicity of ρ[tv]j, we have ρ[tv]2 >0. This means ρ[tv]2 = [ (α−1)tv2 −τ(tv) ] 1 α−1 >0, in particular, we have (α−1)tv2 −τ(tv) >0. However, recall that (α−1)t(v1 −v2) ≥1, which implies (α−1)tv1 −τ(tv) >1. This results in ρ[tv]1 = [ (α−1)tv1 −τ(tv) ] 1 α−1 >1, thus contradicting ρ[tv]1 <1. Therefore, ρ[tv]1 = 1 must hold. C Details of the Step 1 in the proof sketch (§ 4.1) We start by formally deﬁning the function class F(δ). F(δ) := { Z ↦→ ∑ G∈Gδ AG1 { Z ∈G + [0,δ)d×n} |Z ∈D,AG ∈Rd×n } , where Gδ := {0,δ,..., 1 −δ}d×n. We now state and prove the lemma. 14Lemma 5. For any f ∈F and ϵ >0, there exists a small enough δ >0 such that there exists f ∈F(δ) such that dp(f,f) ≤ϵ/2. Proof Since f : D → Rd×n is a continuous function on a compact domain, it is uniformly continuous. Also, continuity is deﬁned with respect to entry-wise ℓp norm which is equivalent to entry-wise ℓ∞norm, uniform continuity leads to ∀ϵ> 0,∃δ >0 such that ∀X,Y ,∥X −Y ∥∞<δ =⇒ ∥f(X) −f(Y )∥p <ϵ/2. Then, suppose we create a set of cube grid pointsGδ := {0,δ,..., 1−δ}d×n, and deﬁne a piece-wise constant approximation f(X) = ∑ G∈Gδ f(G)1 { X ∈G + [0,δ)d×n} . Note that for any X ∈G + [0,δ)d×n we have ∥X −G∥∞<δ, so we have f(X) −f(X)  p = ∥f(X) −f(G)∥p <ϵ/2. This implies that dp(f,f) = (∫ D f(X) −f(X) p p )1/p ≤ϵ/2, ﬁnishing the proof of the lemma. D Proof of Lemma 3 (Step 2 in § 4.1) In this section, we describe in further details how modiﬁed sparse Transformers (the class ST 2,1,1 ) are able to exactly express arbitrary piecewise constant functions in F(δ). We show that we can compute a contextual mapping of the entire input sequences without relying on dense self-attention layers. The token-wise feed-forward layers then transform these contextual mappings to the desired output sequence. To give a high level summary of the proof, we want to show that given a piece-wise constant function f ∈F(δ), there exists a modiﬁed Transformer network g∈ST 2,1,1 that exactly represents f. Recall ﬁrst that the function class ST 2,1,1 has an additive positional embedding matrix E ∈Rd×n that is added to input before the input is fed to the network. We start by choosing the positional embedding E and construct a Transformer network that implements quantization of the input, contextual mapping of the quantized input, and value mapping of the context ids. 1. Choose the positional embedding E according to γin Assumption 1.2. After addition, each column of the input Xk + Ek are in disjoint intervals. 2. Given the input X + E, a series of modiﬁed feed-forward layers quantizes it so that each entry of the quantized input has a value in {0,δ,...,n −δ}(Lemma 6). 3. Next, a series of modiﬁed sparse self-attention layers takes the quantized input H and implement a contextual mapping qsuch that, for different quantized input sequences H and H′, all the elements in q(H) and q(H′) are distinct (Lemma 7). 4. Finally, a series of modiﬁed feed-forward layers maps each element in the context id q(H) to the desired output value of f ∈Fat the input X (Lemma 8). We defer the proofs of Lemmas 6, 7, and 8 to a separate section: see § E. Before discussing the details of each step, we note that although a Transformer network stacks self-attention and feed-forward layers in an alternate manner, we can use a series of arbitrary number of the same layers, thanks to skip connections. The outline of the proof is similar to [ 33], but key component in their proof called selective shift operation relies on the fact that each token can attend to the entire sequence; this is not true in sparse Transformers, which poses a nontrivial challenge. We overcome this issue by a more careful construction of the positional embedding E and sparse self-attention layers. 15D.1 Choosing the positional embedding Recall from Assumption 1.2 that there exists a permutation γ : [n] →[n] such that for all i∈[n−1], γ(i) is one of the tokens that the γ(i+ 1)-th token directly attends to. Using this permutation γ, we choose the columns of positional embedding E in the following way: Eγ(1) = (n−1)1n, and Eγ(i) = (i−2)1n, for i∈[2 : n] As a result, theγ(1)-th column ofX+E will be in the range[n−1,n)d, and similarlyXγ(i)+Eγ(i) ∈ [i−2,i −1)d for i∈[2 : n]. This means that the entries corresponding to different tokens lie be in disjoint intervals of the form [j,j + 1), where j ∈[0 : n−1]. D.2 Quantization by feed-forward layers Note from the previous step that each entry of X + E must be in [0,n). Next, we quantize this interval [0,n) of input using to a set of δ-grid points {0,δ,...,n −δ}. This allows us to deal with ﬁnite set of values, which proves useful in the later stages of the proof. The next lemma shows that the quantization can be carried out using a seried of the modiﬁed feed-forward layers. Lemma 6. Consider a entry-wise quantization map gent q : R →R: gent q (t) = {kδ if kδ ≤t< (k+ 1)δ, k∈[0 : n/δ−1], t otherwise. There exists a function gq : Rd×n ↦→Rd×n composed of dn δ token-wise feed-forward layers with r= 1 and an activation φ∈Φ, which implements the entry-wise quantization gent q to each entry of its input. D.3 Contextual mapping by sparse self-attention layers After the input X + E is quantized, the output of gq must be in the following set Hδ ⊂Rd×n: Hδ := {G + E ∈Rd×n |G ∈Gδ}, where Gδ := {0,δ,..., 1 −δ}d×n was deﬁned to be the δ-cubic grid points of [0,1)d×n. Using this ﬁnite set of sequences, we construct a contextual mapping that maps each sequence in Hδ to unique numbers. Recall that the sparse attention layer has psparsity patterns that rotate in cycles, and Assumption 1.3 assumes that one token directly/indirectly access all the other tokens after ssuch sparse attention layers. We now state the lemma. Lemma 7. Assume that n≥2, and δ−1 is an integer satisfying δ−1 ≥2. Suppose that the sparse self-attention layers (h = 2,m = 1) satisfy Assumption 1 and employ the hardmax σH operator, and that the positional embedding E was chosen as described in § D.1. Then, there exist a function gc : Rd×n →Rd×n composed of p(n−1) δd + ssparse self-attention layers, and a vector u ∈Rd, such that q(H) := uTgc(H) satisﬁes the following properties: 1. For any H ∈Hδ, the entries of q(H) are all distinct. 2. For any H,H′∈Hδ such that H ̸= H′, all entries of q(H), q(H′) are distinct. This contextual mapping maps each unique sequence/context into different context ids, enabling the network to distinguish the same token appearing in different sequences. D.4 Value mapping by feed-forward layers After the contextual mapping, we use the token-wise feed-forward layers to map each different context ids to the desired output value of the target function f. More speciﬁcally, recall the function gc from Lemma 7. For any H ∈Hδ, we need to map the output gc(H) of Lemma 7 to the desired function value f(H −E) (recall that H is the quantized input after adding E to X, so we need to subtract E). This is done by implementing a token-wise value mapping using the feed-forward layers. 16Lemma 8. There exists a function gv : Rd×n → Rd×n composed of n(1 δ)dn token-wise feed- forward layers (r = 1) with an activation φ′∈Φ such that gv is deﬁned by a token-wise function gtkn v : Rd →Rd on each column, gv(Z) = [ gtkn v (Z1) ··· gtkn v (Zn) ] , where for all H ∈Hδ and k∈{1,...,n }, gtkn v (gc(H)k) = f(H −E)k. D.5 Finishing the proof Given Lemmas 6, 7, and 8, one can easily check that for any G ∈Gδ := {0,δ,..., 1 −δ}d×n and any input value X ∈G + [0,δ)d×n, we have gv ◦gc ◦gq(X + E) = gv ◦gc(G + E) = [ gtkn v (gc(G + E)1) gtkn v (gc(G + E)2) ··· gtkn v (gc(G + E)n) ] = [ f(G)1 f(G)2 ··· f(G)n ] = f(G) = f(X). Therefore, we have constructed a modiﬁed sparse Transformer networkg(X) := gv ◦gc ◦gq(X +E) that satisﬁes g(X) = f(X) for all X ∈D, hence proving Lemma 3. E Proof of Lemmas 6, 7, and 8 E.1 Proof of Lemma 6 The proof goes as follows. Using n δ token-wise feed-forward layers, we implement the quantization function gent q that quantizes the ﬁrst row of the input. Then we stack another n δ layers to quantize the second row, and so on. For the ﬁrst row, we add n/δlayers of the following form, for k∈[0 : n/δ−1]. Z ↦→Z + e(1)φ((e(1))TZ −kδ1T n), φ(t) = {0 t< 0 or t≥δ, −t 0 ≤t<δ, where e(1) ∈Rd is the ﬁrst canonical basis vector e(1) = (1,0,..., 0). Each layer quantizes Z1,: in [kδ,kδ + δ) to kδ, without modifying other intervals or other rows of Z. Note that the activation φis a piecewise linear function with three pieces; hence, φ∈Φ. Therefore, the layers satisfy the deﬁnition of modiﬁed feed-forward layers. We can now repeat the same construction for the d−1 remaining rows. E.2 Proof of Lemma 7 In order to construct a network gc that implements the contextual mapping, we ﬁrst introduce two operations referred to as the sparse selective shift operation and all-max-shift operation, implemented by at most two (modiﬁed) sparse attention heads of head size 1. Then, we proceed to stack layers implementing the selective shift operations and all-max-shift operations, and prove that these layers map input H ∈Hδ to unique context ids. E.2.1 Preliminaries Sparse selective shift operation. Given any vector u ∈Rd, ﬁrst consider the following function implementable with a sparse attention head with head size 1 and sparsity pattern {Al k}k∈[n]. For k∈[n], the function ψl : Rd×n →R1×n computes each of its output column in the following way: ψl(Z; bQ)k := uTZAl k σH[(uTZAl k )T(uTZk −bQ)] = { maxj∈Al k uTZj if uTZk >bQ, minj∈Al k uTZj if uTZk <bQ. One can consider a sparse self-attention layer that consists of two such heads, with bQ <b′ Q: Ψl(Z; c,bQ,b′ Q) := Z + [ ce(1) −ce(1)][ψl(Z; bQ) ψl(Z; b′ Q) ] . 17The (1,k)-th entry of Ψl(Z; c,bQ,b′ Q) reads Ψl(Z; c,bQ,b′ Q)1,k = Z1,k + c(ψl(Z; bQ)k −ψl(Z; b′ Q)k) = { Z1,k + c(maxj∈Al k uTZj −minj∈Al k uTZj) if bQ <uTZk <b′ Q, Z1,k if uTZk /∈[bQ,b′ Q]. This means that for input columns Zk satisfying uTZk ∈(bQ,b′ Q) only, Ψl shifts up the ﬁrst entry of Zk by the difference of maximum and minimum values of uTZj over the sparsity pattern j ∈Al k, while leaving other columns intact. By choosing bQ and b′ Q properly, we can selectively modify certain columns without touching other columns; we refer to this operation Ψl as the sparse selective shift operation, and we will see later that this is indeed the key ingredient of our proof. In fact, this operation is a sparse version of the selective shift operation used in [ 33]. Since Al k is usually only a small subset of [n], one cannot calculate the maximum and minimum of uTZj over the whole sequence, as done in [33]. Instead, we use Assumption 1.2 and a more careful choice of E to get around the restriction posed by sparsity. All-max-shift operation. Suppose the input Z ∈Rd×n satisﬁes uTZ >0 entry-wise, for a vector u ∈Rd. Then, the all-max-shift operation Ωl : Rd×n →Rd×n is a sparse self-attention layer that consists of one attention head: Ωl(Z; c) = Z + ce(1)ψl(Z; 0). The (1,k)-th entry of Ωl(Z; c) reads Ωl(Z; c)1,k = Z1,k + cψl(Z; 0)k = Z1,k + cmax j∈Al k uTZj. So, for each column k, the all-max-shift operation shifts up the ﬁrst entry of Zk by the maximum value of uTZj over the sparsity pattern j ∈Al k. Unlike the selective shift operation, the all-max-shift operation is applied to all the columns. Column ids. Recall that the any input to this step is in Hδ := {G + E ∈Rd×n |G ∈Gδ := [0 : δ: 1 −δ]d×n}. Because of the way E is chosen according to the permutation γin Assumption 1.2, for any H ∈Hδ we have Hγ(1) ∈[n−1 : δ: n−δ]d, Hγ(i) ∈[i−2 : δ: i−1 −δ]d for all i∈[2 : n]. Now consider u := (1,δ−1,δ−2,...,δ −d+1). It is easy to check that for any H ∈Hδ, the map Hk ↦→uTHk is one-to-one, and uTHγ(1) ∈ [ (n−1) d−1∑ i=0 δ−i : δ: (n−1) d−1∑ i=0 δ−i + δ−d+1 −δ ] , uTHγ(i) ∈ [ (i−2) d−1∑ i=0 δ−i : δ: (i−2) d−1∑ i=0 δ−i + δ−d+1 −δ ] , for i∈[2 : n]. (7) Hence, for each column Hk, the inner product uTHk is in an interval disjoint from the other columns. Thus, uTHk can be thought as a “column id” that identiﬁes the column’s original input valueGk as well as its position k. Note furthermore that for any H ∈Hδ, uTHγ(2) <uTHγ(3) <··· <uTHγ(n) <uTHγ(1). (8) E.2.2 Construction of layers Given these preliminaries, we now describe our construction of gc. Recall from Assumption 1.2 that the permutation γsatisﬁes γ(i−1) ∈⋃p l=1 Al γ(i) for i∈[2 : n]. From this, for i∈[2 : n] we let 18li ∈[p] be any index such that γ(i−1) ∈Ali γ(i). For simplicity of notation, let zk := uTHk for k∈[n] and ∆ = ∑d−1 i=0 δ−i. Next, starting from i= 2, we want to sequentially stack δ−d sparse selective shift operations Ψli(·; δ−d,b −δ/2,b + δ/2), in increasing order of b∈ [ (i−2)∆ : δ: (i−2)∆ + δ−d+1 −δ ] . That is, we want to add sparse attention layers with sparsity patterns Ali γ(i) that apply the selective shift operation to each possible value of zγ(i). Recall that the sparsity patterns have to cycle from A1 k to Ap k, so we have to place other remaining p−1 sparsity patterns (whose indices are not li) in between the Ψli layers. This can be done by setting all the other sparse attention layers to be the identity. This way, we stack a total of pδ−d sparse attention layers for i= 2, another pδ−d for i= 3, and so on, up to i= n. After these layers, we further stack sall-max-shift operations. For i= 1,...,s , we add all-max-shift operations of the form Ω(i−1) mod p+1(·; 2snδ−nd−1). Here, the superscript (i−1) mod p+ 1 is there to make sure that we cycle through the sparsity patterns from 1 to p, until we stack slayers in total. This ﬁnishes the construction of our function gc composed of p(n−1) δd + ssparse self-attention layers. E.2.3 Selective shift operations We now explain how these stacked self-attention layers implement a contextual mapping. This subsection will consider the selective shift operations part; all-max-shift operations are described in the next subsection. Suppose that after the input H ∈Hδ is processed through the ﬁrst p(n−1) δd layers, we get ˜H ∈Rd×n at the output. We will show at the end of this subsection that the map H ↦→uT˜Hγ(n) is a one-to-one map for column γ(n), so the selective shift operations compute a “unique id” for each possible input sequenceH ∈Hδ. First selective shift. First consider the ﬁrst pδ−d layers. Omitting layers that are identity, they are essentially selective shift operations Ψl2 (·; δ−d,b −δ/2,b + δ/2) for b ∈[0 : δ : δ−d+1 −δ]. Since [0 : δ : δ−d+1 −δ] is the set of possible values of zγ(2), these layers perform selective shift operation on the γ(2)-th column without changing the other columns. Each possible value of Hγ(2) undergoes one and only shift operation (by the corresponding layer with b= uTHγ(2)), by which the (1,γ(2))-th entry of the input is updated. Recall by Assumption 1.2 thatγ(1) ∈Al2 γ(2), and that zγ(1) and zγ(2) are the maximum and minimum over the whole sequence z1,...,z n (see (8)). By Assumption 1.1 we also have γ(2) ∈Al2 γ(2). Since both γ(1) and γ(2) are in Al2 γ(2), the maximum and minimum value ofzj := uTHj’s overj ∈Al2 γ(2) are zγ(1) and zγ(2), respectively. Therefore, the (1,γ(2))-th entry of the input matrix is shifted up as follows: ˜H1,γ(2) := H1,γ(2) + δ−d(zγ(1) −zγ(2)). Let ˜Hγ(2) be the γ(2)-th column after the shift operation has shifted H1,γ(2) to ˜H1,γ(2). Then, deﬁne ˜zγ(2) := uT˜Hγ(2) = zγ(2) + δ−d(zγ(1) −zγ(2)). Note that ˜zγ(2) >zγ(1) because zγ(2) + δ−d(zγ(1) −zγ(2)) >zγ(1) ⇔(δ−d −1)(zγ(1) −zγ(2)) >0, which is true. Therefore, ˜zγ(2) becomes the new maximum among the current values zγ(1),˜zγ(2),zγ(3),...,z γ(n), and the new minimum element is zγ(3). Second selective shift. We now consider the nextpδ−d layers, which are essentially Ψl3 (·; δ−d,b− δ/2,b + δ/2) for b∈[∆ : δ: ∆ +δ−d+1 −δ]. They apply the shift operation to the γ(3)-th column. Since we have γ(2),γ(3) ∈Al3 γ(3), the shift operation similarly yields ˜zγ(3) := zγ(3) + δ−d(˜zγ(2) −zγ(3)) = zγ(3) + δ−d(zγ(2) −zγ(3)) + δ−2d(zγ(1) −zγ(2)). 19We can also show ˜zγ(3) >˜zγ(2), because zγ(3) + δ−d(˜zγ(2) −zγ(3)) >˜zγ(2) ⇔(δ−d −1)(˜zγ(2) −zγ(3)) >0. So after this operation ˜zγ(3) and zγ(4) are the new maximum and minimum over the updated sequence zγ(1),˜zγ(2),˜zγ(3),zγ(4),...,z γ(n). Repeating the process. The same process continues. The next pδ−d layers shifts the γ(4)-th columns and results in ˜zγ(4) which is greater than ˜zγ(3). After the ﬁrst p(n−1)δ−d layers, all columns except γ(1)-th column have been shifted, resulting in zγ(1),˜zγ(2),..., ˜zγ(n) satisfying (n−1)∆ ≤zγ(1) <˜zγ(2) <··· <˜zγ(n). (9) Let us denote the output of the p(n−1)δ−d-th layer as ˜H. Selective shifts implement a one-to-one map. Next, we prove that the map from H ∈Hδ to ˜zγ(n) := uT˜Hγ(n) = zγ(n) + n−1∑ i=1 δ−id(zγ(n−i) −zγ(n+1−i)) is one-to-one. Recall that for each column Hk, the map Hk ↦→ uTHk =: zk is one-to-one. Also, permutation of columns is one-to-one, which implies that it sufﬁces to show that the map[zγ(1) ... z γ(n) ] ↦→˜zγ(n) is one-to-one. Suppose we have two sequences [zγ(1) ... z γ(n) ] and [z′ γ(1) ... z ′ γ(n) ] that map to the same value of ˜zγ(n) = ˜z′ γ(n). Then, 0 = ˜zγ(n) −˜z′ γ(n) = zγ(n) −z′ γ(n) + n−1∑ i=1 δ−id(zγ(n−i) −zγ(n+1−i) −z′ γ(n−i) + z′ γ(n+1−i)). Suppose zγ(n) ̸= z′ γ(n). Since they both lie inside [(n−2)∆ : δ: (n−2)∆ + δ−d+1 −δ], we have −δ−d+1 + δ≤zγ(n) −z′ γ(n) ≤δ−d+1 −δ. Note that all the terms other than zγ(n) −z′ γ(n) are of “coarser resolution.” For example, the ﬁrst term δ−d(zγ(n−1) −zγ(n) −z′ γ(n−1) + z′ γ(n)) in the summation can only take values 0,δ−d+1,−δ−d+1,2δ−d+1,−2δ−d+1,... , so it can never cancel the difference zγ(n) −z′ γ(n) and make the sum ˜zγ(n) −˜z′ γ(n) zero. This implies that zγ(n) = z′ γ(n) must hold. Next, suppose zγ(n−1) ̸= z′ γ(n−1). Since we have zγ(n) = z′ γ(n), −δ−2d+1 <δ−d(zγ(n−1) −zγ(n) −z′ γ(n−1) + z′ γ(n)) = δ−d(zγ(n−1) −z′ γ(n−1)) <δ−2d+1. But similarly, any other terms in the summation have coarser resolution than δ−2d+1, so they cannot cancel the difference δ−d(zγ(n−1) −z′ γ(n−1)). Thus zγ(n−1) = z′ γ(n−1) must hold. Repeating the same argument up to γ(1) proves that the two sequences must be equal: [zγ(1) ... z γ(n) ] =[z′ γ(1) ... z ′ γ(n) ] . This proves that the map H ↦→˜zγ(n) is one-to-one and ˜zγ(n) can be seen as the unique id for the input sequence H ∈Hδ. E.2.4 All-max-shift operations Next, we explain the operation of the sall-max-shift layers. Recall from Assumption 1.3 that any token can attend to all the other tokens after ssteps, either directly or indirectly. Also recall from the last subsection that the input to the ﬁrst all-max-shift layer is ˜H, and the maximum entry of uT˜H is ˜zγ(n), the unique id for input H. From the statement of Lemma 7, the output after the s all-max-shift operations for input H is denoted as gc(H). In this subsection, we show that through s all-max-shift operations, the maximum ˜zγ(n) will propagate to all tokens and be a “dominant” term, which determines the interval that uTgc(H) lies in. As a result, we can show Properties 7.1 and 7.2 of gc at the end. 20Some preliminaries. Note that the unique id ˜zγ(n) has the following upper bound: ˜zγ(n) := zγ(n) + n−2∑ i=1 δ−id(zγ(n−i) −zγ(n+1−i)) + δ−(n−1)d(zγ(1) −zγ(2)) ≤zγ(n) + δ−d n−2∑ i=1 (zγ(n−i) −zγ(n+1−i)) + δ−(n−1)d(zγ(1) −zγ(2)) = zγ(n) + δ−d(zγ(2) −zγ(n)) + δ−(n−1)d(zγ(1) −zγ(2)) = δ−(n−1)dzγ(1) −(δ−(n−1)d −δ−d)zγ(2) −(δ−d −1)zγ(n) ≤δ−(n−1)dzγ(1) ≤δ−(n−1)d((n−1)∆ + δ−d+1 −δ) ≤δ−(n−1)d(n−1 + δ)(δ−d −1) ≤δ−nd −δ (10) where we used ∆ := ∑d−1 i=0 δ−i = δ−d−1 δ−1−1 ≤δ−d −1. A similar bound ˜zγ(i) ≤nδ−id −δ (11) also holds from a similar derivation. Next, recall from Assumption 1.3 the deﬁnitions S1 k := A1 k, St k := ⋃ j∈A(t−1) mod p+1 k St−1 j , and that there exists s≥1 such that, for all k∈[n], Ss k = [n]. Finally, the following inequality will be useful throughout: for any integer s≥1, (2s+ 1 2s ) ≤ (2s+ 1 2s )2 ≤···≤ (2s+ 1 2s )s ≤2. (12) Let us now describe the operation that the all-max-shift layers Ω(i−1) mod p+1(·; 2snδ−nd−1), i = 1,...,s , carry out. First all-max-shift. The input to the ﬁrst all-max-shift layer is ˜H. Let the output of the layer be M1. Recall that uT˜H consists of values zγ(1),˜zγ(2),..., ˜zγ(n), which are all strictly greater than 0 and strictly less than nδ−nd (by (10)). So, for each column k∈[n], the layer update reads M1 1,k := ˜H1,k + 2snδ−nd−1 max j∈A1 k uT˜Hj = ˜H1,k + 2snδ−nd−1uT˜Hj1 k , where j1 k := arg maxj∈A1 k uT˜Hj. After the update, uTM1 k is “dominated” by2snδ−nd−1uT˜Hj1 k , meaning that for any k,k′∈[n], uT˜Hj1 k <uT˜Hj1 k′ =⇒ uTMk <uTMk′. This is because the minimum gap between different values of uT˜Hj1 k is at least δ, and we have uT˜Hk <nδ−nd <2snδ−nd−1 ·δ, so if uT˜Hj1 k <uT˜Hj1 k′, that solely determines the order uTMk <uTMk′ because uT˜Hk cannot reverse it. Also, by the deﬁnition of j1 k, for any index set B∈ [n] we have max i∈B uT˜Hj1 i = max j∈⋃ i∈BA1 i uT˜Hj. (13) If s≥2, we move on to the second layer. Second all-max-shift. At the second all-max-shift, we have sparsity patterns A1 mod p+1 k . Let us the output of this layer as M2. For each column k∈[n], the layer update reads M2 1,k := M1 1,k + 2snδ−nd−1 max j∈A1 mod p+1 k uTM1 j = M1 1,k + 2snδ−nd−1uTM1 j2 k , 21where j2 k := arg maxj∈A1 mod p+1 k uTM1 j. If we look at the update more closely, we can apply (13) and get uTM2 k = uT˜Hk + 2snδ−nd−1uT˜Hj1 k + 2snδ−nd−1(uT˜Hj2 k + 2snδ−nd−1 max i∈A1 mod p+1 k uT˜Hj1 i ) = uT˜Hk + 2snδ−nd−1(uT˜Hj1 k + uT˜Hj2 k ) + (2snδ−nd−1)2 max j∈S2 k uT˜Hj. Again, the last term dominates the rest of the terms in uTM2 k, because the minimum gap between different values of maxj∈S2 k uT˜Hj is at least δ, and uTM2 k −(2snδ−nd−1)2 max j∈S2 k uT˜Hj = uT˜Hk + 2snδ−nd−1(uT˜Hj1 k + uT˜Hj2 k ) <(1 + 4snδ−nd−1)nδ−nd ≤(1 + 4s)n2δ−2nd−1 ≤(2snδ−nd−1)2 ·δ= 4s2n2δ−2nd−1. The last inequality holds due to inequality (12), because (2s+ 1 2s )2 ≤2 ⇔1 + 4s≤4s2 is true for s≥2. Remaining all-max-shifts. If s≥3, we move on to the third layer, which outputs M3. Similarly, we can show that uTM3 k is dominated by (2snδ−nd−1)3 maxj∈S3 k uT˜Hj because the rest of the terms in uTM3 k is strictly upper-bounded uTM3 k −(2snδ−nd−1)3 max j∈S3 k uT˜Hj <(1 + 3·2snδ−nd−1 + 3 ·(2snδ−nd−1)2)nδ−nd−1, which can then be shown to be smaller than (2snδ−nd−1)3 ·δ: (1 + 3·2snδ−nd−1 + 3·(2snδ−nd−1)2)nδ−nd ≤(1 + 6s+ 12s2)n3δ−3nd−2 ≤8s3n3δ−3nd−3 ·δ. The last inequality is due to the fact that 1 + 6s+ 12s2 ≤8s3 for s≥3, which can derived from (12). Repeating this process, after all slayers we get Ms, and uTMs k is dominated by (2snδ−nd−1)smax j∈Ss k uT˜Hj = (2snδ−nd−1)smax j∈[n] uT˜Hj = (2snδ−nd−1)s˜zγ(n). This is because the remaining terms in uTMs k can be strictly upper-bounded uTMs k −(2snδ−nd−1)s˜zγ(n) < (s−1∑ i=0 (s i ) (2snδ−nd−1)i ) nδ−nd, which is then dominated by the smallest difference possible in (2snδ−nd−1)s˜zγ(n): (s−1∑ i=0 (s i ) (2snδ−nd−1)i ) nδ−nd ≤ (s−1∑ i=0 (s i ) (2s)i ) (nδ−nd−1)s−1nδ−nd = ((1 + 2s)s −(2s)s)(nδ−nd−1)s ·δ≤(2snδ−nd−1)s ·δ. The last inequality used (1 + 2s)s −(2s)s ≤(2s)s, derived from (12). E.2.5 Verifying Properties 7.1 and 7.2 After these all-max-shift operations, we deﬁne the output Ms of the last all-max-shift layers to be the output of the function gc for input H, i.e., gc(H) := Ms. Property 7.1 requires that for any H ∈Hδ, all the components uTgc(H) need to be distinct. This is true, because for each column of uTgc(H), we have uTgc(H)k mod 2snδ−nd = uT˜Hk. 22This is because anything added by the all-max-shift operations is an integer multiple of 2snδ−nd, and uT˜Hk <nδ −nd <2nδ−nd for all k. Recall that ˜H is the input matrix for the ﬁrst max-shift operation, and that the components of uT˜H are zγ(1),˜zγ(2),..., ˜zγ(n), which were shown to be distinct by (9). Since uTgc(H)k produce distinct outputs for a mod operation, they themselves have to distinct. This proves Property 7.1. Also, by the “domination” argument in the previous subsection, the outputgc(H) has the property that for any column, uTgc(H)k lies inside an interval determined by ˜zγ(n), the unique id for the input H: uTgc(H)k ∈ [ (2snδ−nd−1)s˜zγ(n),(2snδ−nd−1)s(˜zγ(n) + δ) ) , and these intervals do not overlap because any different values of ˜zγ(n) must differ by at least δ. This means that for any input H,H′∈Hδ, the components in uTgc(H) and uTgc(H′) lie in disjoint intervals. Together with Property 7.1, this proves Property 7.2. E.3 Proof of Lemma 8 To prove this lemma, we implement a token-wise function that maps gtkn v (gc(H)k) = f(H −E)k, for all H ∈Hδ and k ∈[n]. From the construction of Lemma 7, there are n|Hδ|= n δdn distinct values of uTgc(H)k, and different values of uTgc(H)k differ by at least δ. The implementation of gtkn v can be done by stacking feed-forward layers so that each layer maps one unique number to the corresponding output column. More precisely, choose any H ∈Hδ. For each of the nvalues of uTgc(H)k, we add one feed- forward layer of the form Z ↦→Z+(f(H−E)k−gc(H)k)φ′(uTZ−uTgc(H)k1T n), φ′(t) = {0 t< −δ/2 or t≥δ/2, 1 −δ/2 ≤t<δ/ 2. This layer updates any column j of its input Z that satisﬁes uTgc(H)k −δ/2 ≤ uTZj < uTgc(H)k + δ/2, without modifying any other columns that are out of this range. We stack these layers for all possible values ofH ∈Hδ. After n δdn such layers, we get the desired function gv that satisﬁes gv(Z) = [ gtkn v (Z1) ··· gtkn v (Zn) ] , where for all H ∈Hδ and k∈[n], gtkn v (gc(H)k) = f(H −E)k. F Proof of Lemma 4 (Step 3 in § 4.1) In this section, we describe how the modiﬁed sparse Transformer networkg∈ST 2,1,1 constructed in Lemma 3 can be approximated with an original sparse Transformer network g∈ST 2,1,4. Recall that gis a “modiﬁed” sparse Transformer network, which employ the hardmax σH operators in place of ρ operators in sparse self-attention layers and piecewise linear activations φ∈Φ instead of ReLUs in feed-forward layers. The goal of this lemma is to approximate the functiong= gv ◦gc ◦gq ∈ST 2,1,1 with a standard sparse Transformer g = ˜gv ◦˜gc ◦˜gq ∈ST 2,1,4 with accuracy dp(g,g) ≤ϵ/2. As the construction of gconsists of three steps, we will approximate each of them step by step. The whole intuition behind the proof is that as long as we are considering Lp approximation, we can approximate σH and φ∈Φ as closely as we want with ρand ReLUs, respectively. However, as the proof will show, controlling the aggregated error over layers is not a trivial job. F.1 Approximating the quantization function gq (Lemma 6) We ﬁrst consider approximating gq from Lemma 6 with a standard feed-forward layer counterpart, ˜gq. Recall from § E.1 that the modiﬁed feed-forward layers used in gq are of the form Z ↦→Z + e(i)φ((e(i))TZ −kδ1T n), φ(t) = {0 t< 0 or t≥δ, −t 0 ≤t<δ, (14) 23for i∈[d] and k ∈[0 : n/δ−1]. Note that the activation φ∈Φ can be closely approximated by three ReLUs: ˜φα(t) := −ReLU(t) + 1 αReLU(t−(1 −α)δ) −1 −α α ReLU(t−δ) =    0 t≤0 or t≥δ, −t 0 ≤t≤(1 −α)δ, 1−α α (t−δ) (1 −α)δ≤t≤δ, where 0 < α <1. Note that ˜φα(t) = φ(t) except for an interval ((1 −α)δ,δ), and by shrinking α >0 this interval can be made arbitrarily small. Consider approximating the layers (14) with standard feed-forward layers, by replacing φwith its approximation ˜φα. Let the resulting function be ˜gq ∈ST 2,1,3. Then, it is easy to check that gq(X + E) = ˜gq(X + E) holds if all coordinates of X ∈[0,1)d×n are in the intervals of the form [kδ,(k+ 1 −α)δ] for some k ∈[0 : n/δ−1]; i.e., the intervals in which ˜φα perfectly approximates φ. The Lebesgue measure of the set of such inputs X is ((1 −α)δ)nd × 1 δnd = (1 −α)nd, and this can be made arbitrarily close to 1 by makingαsmall. As a result, “most” of the inputX ∈D satisﬁes gq(X + E) = ˜gq(X + E) ∈Hδ, while a small fraction (of measure at most 1 −(1 −α)nd) can map to some other values. For most of the remaining of the proof, we will consider the fraction of inputs mapped correctly to Hδ and bound their approximation error. We will come back to the 1 −(1 −α)nd fraction at the end of the proof. F.2 Approximating the contextual mapping gc (Lemma 7) Let us now consider approximating the contextual mapping gc in Lemma 7, constructed using the hardmax σH operators, with the standard sparse self-attention layers employing ρoperator. We will call the approximation ˜gc. Recall that ρsatisﬁes Assumption 2: Assumption 2. For any ζ >0 and η∈(0,1], ∃t> 0 such that, for any column input v satisfying vj∗−maxj̸=j∗vj ≥ζ(where j∗= arg maxjvj), we have ρ[tv]j∗ ≥1 −ηand ∑ j̸=j∗ρ[tv]j ≤η. This means that ρcan closely approximate σH in the sense that whenever the input vector v to the ρoperator has a maximum element vj∗ by some margin ζ, then the j∗-th component of the output ρ[tv] is close to 1, while the other components of ρ[tv] are close to 0. Recall that gc consists of two parts. The ﬁrst part is a composition of sparse selective shift operations, and the second is a composition of all-max-shift operations. We will ﬁrst examine how “errors” are introduced when σH is replaced with ρin both operations, discuss how the errors accumulate, and show how to choose the right ζand ηto control the errors in the approximation ˜gc. Errors introduced by ρ: Sparse selective shift operation. Recall that the key component in both the selective shift operation and all-max-shift operation is the sparse attention head ψl(·), which computes its k-th column as the following: ψl(Z; bQ)k := uTZAl k σH[(uTZAl k )T(uTZk −bQ)] = { maxj∈Al k uTZj if uTZk >bQ, minj∈Al k uTZj if uTZk <bQ. Now suppose we replaced σH with ρsatisfying Assumption 2. Suppose each entry in uTZ differs at least by δ, which is true in the construction of gc. We choose ζ = δ/2 and some 0 <η <1, and corresponding t> 0. Then, replace σH[·] with ρ[t·] and deﬁne ˜ψl(Z; bQ)k := uTZAl k ρ[t(uTZAl k )T(uTZk −bQ)]. If uTZk >bQ, it is easy to check that ˜ψl(Z; bQ)k satisﬁes (1 −η) max j∈Al k uTZj + η min j∈Al k uTZj ≤˜ψl(Z; bQ)k ≤max j∈Al k uTZj. (15) 24Similarly, if uTZk <bQ, we have min j∈Al k uTZj ≤˜ψl(Z; bQ)k ≤(1 −η) min j∈Al k uTZj + ηmax j∈Al k uTZj. Now consider the approximate sparse selective shift operator ˜Ψl, implemented with ˜ψl. For bQ <b′ Q, we deﬁne ˜Ψl(Z; c,bQ,b′ Q) := Z + [ ce(1) −ce(1)] [ ˜ψl(Z; bQ) ˜ψl(Z; b′ Q) ] . For any column Zk satisfying bQ <uTZk <b′ Q, we have (1 −2η) ( max j∈Al k uTZj −min j∈Al k uTZj ) ≤˜ψl(Z; bQ)k −˜ψl(Z; b′ Q)k ≤max j∈Al k uTZj −min j∈Al k uTZj, and for any column Zk satisfying uTZk /∈[bQ,b′ Q], we get |˜ψl(Z; bQ)k −˜ψl(Z; b′ Q)k|≤ η ( max j∈Al k uTZj −min j∈Al k uTZj ) . Recall that for the hardmax σH version, we had ψl(Z; bQ)k −ψl(Z; b′ Q)k = { maxj∈Al k uTZj −minj∈Al k uTZj if bQ <uTZk <b′ Q, 0 if uTZk /∈[bQ,b′ Q]. From this observation, the approximation error ˜Ψl−Ψl of the selective shift operator on the (j,k)-th entry of the output can be bounded as follows: ˜Ψl(Z; c,bQ,b′ Q)j,k −Ψl(Z; c,bQ,b′ Q)j,k ∈    [−2cηDl k,0] if j = 1,uTZk ∈(bQ,b′ Q), [−cηDl k,cηDl k] if j = 1,uTZk /∈[bQ,b′ Q], {0} if j ̸= 1, where we used Dl k := maxj∈Al k uTZj −minj∈Al k uTZj for simplicity. Errors introduced by ρ: All-max-shift operation. Next, we examine the approximation error of the all-max-shift operation introduced by replacement of σH with ρ. Let us deﬁne the approximate all-max-shift operation ˜Ωl: ˜Ωl(Z; c) = Z + ce(1) ˜ψl(Z; 0). From (15), we can check that the approximation error ˜Ωl −Ωl of the all-max-shift operation is bounded as ˜Ωl(Z; c)j,k −Ωl(Z; c)j,k ∈ {[−cηDl k,0] if j = 1, {0} if j ̸= 1. Errors in selective shift operations. Given these approximation error bounds of single operations, we now analyze the accumulation of errors through multiple layers. We ﬁrst consider the ﬁrst pδ−d self-attention layers in gc. Recall that they consist of selective shift layersΨl2 (·; δ−d,b−δ/2,b+δ/2) for b∈[0 : δ: δ−d+1 −δ] and (p−1)δ−d identity layers. A natural way to approximate these layers with standard self-attention layers is to use approximate layers ˜Ψl2 (·; δ−d,b −δ/2,b + δ/2), with sufﬁciently large t> 0. As we have seen above, there is no error introduced by ρexcept for the ﬁrst row. Thus, we will analyze the approximation error of ˜Ψl2 (·; δ−d,b −δ/2,b + δ/2) for the ﬁrst row only. Let us remind the readers how the ﬁrst selective shift operation (done by the ﬁrst pδ−d layers) originally worked in gc. The input to gc is H, and we deﬁne zk := uTHk and ∆ = ∑d−1 i=0 δ−i. Recall from Eqs. (7) and (8) in § E.2 that 0 ≤zγ(2) <zγ(3) <··· <zγ(n) <zγ(1) ≤(n−1)∆ + δ−d+1 −δ <nδ−d 25and zγ(2) ∈[0 : δ: δ−d+1 −δ], so zγ(2) will undergo the selective shift by one of the self-attention layers, which updates the (1,γ(2))-th entry of the input. Let ˜Hγ(2) be the updated value of the column and ˜zγ(2) := uT˜Hγ(2). The new sequence satisﬁes ∆ ≤zγ(3) <··· <zγ(n) <zγ(1) <˜zγ(2) <nδ−2d, where the strict upper bound on ˜zγ(2) is from Eq. (11). In case of the approximation ˜Ψl2 , we have seen that the error depends on the gap between maximum and minimum of uTZj’s, and this gap may grow larger as error accumulates; in the worst case, it may grow exponentially. To see this, suppose a0 and b0 are the maximum and minimum value of uTZj’s, and they go through a selective shift operation, but they do not belong to the range of the operation (bQ,b′ Q). Then, a0 and b0 will be updated to a1 and b1, which are bounded by a1 ≤a0 + δ−dη(a0 −b0), b1 ≥b0 −δ−dη(a0 −b0). After the next layer, we get a2 ≤a1 + δ−dη(a1 −b1) ≤a0 + δ−dη(a0 −b0) + δ−dη(1 + 2δ−dη)(a0 −b0), b2 ≥b1 −δ−dη(a1 −b1) ≥b0 −δ−dη(a0 −b0) −δ−dη(1 + 2δ−dη)(a0 −b0). Similarly, after ksuch layers, we get ak ≤a0 + (a0 −b0)δ−dη k−1∑ i=0 (1 + 2δ−dη)i, bk ≥b0 −(a0 −b0)δ−dη k−1∑ i=0 (1 + 2δ−dη)i, showing that the gap ak −bk may grow exponentially in the worst case: ak −bk ≤(1 + 2δ−dη)k(a0 −b0). In the error-less case (σH), for any input sequence H, the maximum possible difference between maximum and minimum of uTH is bounded above by nδ−d, and after one selective shift operation was done on the γ(2)-th column, the difference is then bounded by nδ−2d. Therefore, the worst-case possible error introduced by ρ is bounded above by the sum of the worst-case errors calculated assuming that we started off with max-min difference nδ−2d. Using this observation, the error on each ﬁrst-row entry of the sequence after the ﬁrst pδ−d layers is bounded above by 2nδ−2d ·δ−dη δ−d−1∑ i=0 (1 + 2δ−dη)i, (16) where a factor of 2 is introduced because when the selective shift operation is applied to the γ(2)-th column, it may introduce an error which is twice the magnitude of the error introduced to the other columns. We want to make (16) smaller than δ 8n. By Assumption 2, we can always choose t> 0 that satisﬁes the assumption for ζ = δ 2, and η= 1 2 δ2dlog ( 1 + δ2d˜δ 8n2 ) >0, where ˜δ:= min { δ,21−1/pϵ n1/p } . Using such t, we can control the total accumulated error by the ﬁrst pδ−d selective shift operations below ˜δ 8n: 2nδ−2d ·δ−dη δ−d−1∑ i=0 (1 + 2δ−dη)i ≤2nδ−3dη(1 + 2δ−dη)δ−d −1 (1 + 2δ−dη) −1 = nδ−2d    1 + log ( 1 + δ2d˜δ 8n2 ) δ−d   δ−d −1  ≤nδ−2d ( exp log ( 1 + δ2d˜δ 8n2 ) −1 ) = nδ−2dδ2d˜δ 8n2 = ˜δ 8n. 26Therefore, after the ﬁrst pδ−d selective shift layers, the accumulated error for each entry of the ﬁrst row is at most ˜δ/8n. We can also apply similar arguments to the remaining selective shift layers. For example, for the j-th set of pδ−d selective shift layers where the operation is done on γ(j+ 1)-th column of the input, the gap between the maximum and the minimum, including the accumulated error from previous layers, is bounded above by nδ−(j+1)d. Therefore, for this set of layers, the maximum accumulated error is bounded by 2nδ−(j+1)d ·δ−dη δ−d−1∑ i=0 (1 + 2δ−dη)i. So, choosing t> 0 that satisﬁes Assumption 2 for η = δ 2 and η = 1 2 δ2dlog(1 + δ(j+1)d˜δ 8n2 ), we can control the accumulated error introduced by the pδ−d layers below δ 8n: 2nδ−(j+1)d ·δ−dη δ−d−1∑ i=0 (1 + 2δ−dη)i ≤2nδ−(j+2)dη(1 + 2δ−dη)δ−d −1 (1 + 2δ−dη) −1 ≤nδ−(j+1)d    1 + log ( 1 + δ(j+1)d˜δ 8n2 ) δ−d   δ−d −1  ≤ ˜δ 8n. In total, the accumulated error by the ﬁrst p(n−1)/δd layers, which correspond to the selective shift operation part of the construction, is at most (n−1)˜δ 8n ≤ ˜δ 8 . Errors in all-max-shift operations. For all-max-shift operations, we approximate the hardmax σH all-max-shift operations Ωl(Z; nδ−nd) with its ρ-counterparts, ˜Ωl(Z; nδ−nd). We can similarly bound the accumulated error in the all-max-shift operations. Recall from § E.2 that during the whole series of all-max-shift operations, the maximum entry in the sequence is upper-bounded by (2snδ−nd−1)snδ−nd and minimum entry is lower-bounded by(n−1)∆. Therefore, the gap between the max and min elements, taking into consideration the errors from selective shift operations, is bounded from above by (2snδ−nd−1)snδ−nd. Then, using a similar argument as the select shift operation layers, the maximum error is bounded above by (2snδ−nd−1)snδ−nd ·nδ−ndη s−1∑ i=0 (1 + nδ−ndη)i, and we want to make it smaller than ˜δ 8 . By Assumption 2, we can always choose t> 0 that satisﬁes the assumption for ζ = δ 2, and η= δnd sn log ( 1 + δs(nd+1)+nd˜δ 2s+3ssns+1 ) >0. Using such t, we can control the total accumulated error by the ﬁrst pδ−d selective shift operations below ˜δ 8 : (2snδ−nd−1)snδ−nd ·nδ−ndη s−1∑ i=0 (1 + nδ−ndη)i ≤(2snδ−nd−1)snδ−nd ·nδ−ndη(1 + nδ−ndη)s −1 (1 + nδ−ndη) −1 = (2snδ−nd−1)snδ−nd    1 + log ( 1 + δs(nd+1)+nd˜δ 2s+3ssns+1 ) s   s −1   ≤(2snδ−nd−1)snδ−ndδs(nd+1)+nd˜δ 2s+3ssns+1 = ˜δ 8. 27So far, we have analyzed the total accumulated error of approximating the contextual mapping function gc (constructed with hardmax σH) with an approximation ˜gc (constructed with ρ). We have seen that for any input H ∈Hδ, the approximation error can be controlled so that the error by the selective shift operation part is at most ˜δ/8 and the all-max-shift operation part is at most ˜δ/8. Therefore, the total error of the (j,k)-th entry can be bounded as ˜gc(H)j,k −gc(H)j,k ∈ { [− ˜δ 4 , ˜δ 4 ] j = 1, {0} j ̸= 1, for any H ∈Hδ. F.3 Approximating the value mapping gv (Lemma 8) We now consider the approximation of the value mappinggv with standard feed-forward layers. In gv, we implemented the function with layers of the form Z ↦→Z+(f(H−E)k−gc(H)k)φ′(uTZ−uTgc(H)k1T n), φ′(t) = {0 t< −δ/2 or t≥δ/2, 1 −δ/2 ≤t<δ/ 2. Since the output of contextual mapping gc(H) and its approximation ˜gc(H) differ in only the ﬁrst row and by ˜δ/4 ≤δ/4, one can approximate each layer in gv by replacing φ′with an approximation ˜φ′, implementable with four ReLU’s: ˜φ′(t) =    0 t< −δ/2 or t≥δ/2, 4 δt+ 2 −δ/2 ≤t< −δ/4, 1 −δ/4 ≤t<δ/ 4, −4 δt+ 2 δ/4 ≤t<δ/ 2. Let ˜gv be the approximation of gv constructed this way. Because the error on ˜gc is bounded by ˜δ/4, the error on the ﬁnal output ˜gv is also bounded by ˜δ/4. That is, for any H ∈Hδ, ˜gv(˜gc(H))j,k −gv(gc(H))j,k ∈ { [− ˜δ 4 , ˜δ 4 ] j = 1, {0} j ̸= 1. Hence, using ˜δ:= min { δ,21−1/pϵ n1/p } , we have ∥˜gv(˜gc(H)) −gv(gc(H))∥p p ≤n (˜δ 4 )p ≤1 2 (ϵ 2 )p , for all H ∈Hδ. F.4 Finishing the proof Recall from § F.1 that the approximated quantization function ˜gq maps most of the input X ∈D to H ∈Hδ, and a small fraction of them (of measure at most 1 −(1 −α)nd) to something else. Note now that the original function g = gv ◦gc ◦gq and the approximation g = ˜gv ◦˜gc ◦˜gq are both bounded, so there is a global constant Bsuch chat ∥g(X + E) −g(X + E)∥p ≤Bfor all X ∈D. We can divide the integral overD to two disjoint sets. The ﬁrst one D1 := {X ∈D |˜gq(X + E) ∈ Hδ}is the set of input X mapped to Hδ by ˜gq, and the other is its complement D2 = D \\D1. dp(g,g)p := ∫ D ∥g(X + E) −g(X + E)∥p pdX = ∫ D1 ∥g(X + E) −g(X + E)∥p pdX + ∫ D2 ∥g(X + E) −g(X + E)∥p pdX ≤1 2 (ϵ 2 )p + (1 −(1 −α)nd)Bp. One can make α close enough to 1 so that the second term is less than 1 2 (ϵ 2 )p . This makes dp(g,g) ≤ϵ/2, hence ﬁnishing the proof. 28G Experimental setup G.1 Copying task We generated the synthetic dataset for the copying task. The input sequence to the copying task has the format 0s0s, where s is a 127 length sequence of symbols randomly sampled from the range of [0,127]. The training set contains 100K sequences, while the testing set contains 10K sequences. We implement the copying task as a masked-LM [10] style prediction task by masking all the tokens in the second half of the sequence. For the test examples, each masked token is predicted independently. For the results reported in § 5, we experiment with bidirectional models, where each token can attend to both previous and future tokens. The maximum sequence length is n= 256, and we use embedding dimension d= 256. The model has 1 to 4 attention layers with h= 4 attention heads of size m= 64, followed by a feed-forward hidden layer of size r= 512. We train the model with the AdamW optimizer with weight decay and no dropout. We train the model using 3,000 warmup steps and a total of 500K training steps. The learning rate is 1e−4. We use the batch size 1,024 on 8 TPUv3 chips. For all sparsity patterns other than the RANDOM pattern, we choose the segment length wto be 16 for all patterns. This segment length results in the sparsest level for the STRIDED and FIXED patterns. In Table 1, we include the sparsity level as a reference. For this task, we report the prediction accuracy for all the tokens. G.2 Language modeling For the language modeling task, we train on the One Billion Word Benchmark [5] which contains almost one billion tokens and a vocabulary of more than 800K tokens. We use the Transformer model in the Tensor2Tensor framework [29]. We use a 12-block (cf. (2)) Transformer, with embedding dimension d = 256, maximum sequence length n = 256, number of heads h= 8, head size m= 64, and feed-forward hidden layer size r = 1024. Since language modeling task is auto-regressive (attending to only past tokens) in nature, we evaluate the (sparse) attention score matrices and mask them to be an upper-triangular matrix. We train the model with the Adafactor with weight decay. We train the model using 10K warmup steps and a total of 240K steps. We use the batch size 4,096 on 8 TPUv2 chips. For this task, we report the perplexity. G.3 Translation For the translation task, we train on the WMT18 en-cs datasets (Europarl v7, Common Crawl corpus, News Commentary v13, and CzEng), with a total of 15M pairs of sentences, and test on the newstest2015 en-cs dataset, with 2,656 pairs. We use the encoder-decoder architecture and apply the sparse attention on both encoder and decoder. We use the Transformer model in the Tensor2Tensor framework [ 29] and the same setup as the language modeling task, except for having 6 blocks in the Transformer networks, with head size m= 32 and having autoregressive patterns only in decoders. For this task, we report the cased BLEU score. G.4 GLUE tasks For the GLUE tasks, we use the pre-training and ﬁne-tuning framework [10]. Following Devlin et al. [10] we ﬁrst pre-train a BERTBASE model for 450K steps on the BooksCorpus [36] (800M words) and the English Wikipedia datasets (2,500M words). We later ﬁnetune the model on data from each task separately. For each setting, we use the same sparsity pattern and head conﬁguration in both the pre-training and the ﬁne-tuning stages. The sequence length is n= 128 in both stages. We report the average accuracy of three runs on the dev set for all tasks. For each setting, we pre-train a model and run ﬁne-tuning three times. 29Table 2. Accuracy on the synthetic copying task when using an auto-regressive model.

H Additional experimental results We report additional experimental results in this section. H.1 Copying task We include the results for the copying task using auto-regressive (unidirectional) models as in LM, where each token can only attend to previous tokens, in Table 2. In this case, the STAR pattern cannot attend to the last replay token. Indeed, the STAR pattern shows better performance when the model is bidirectional (cf. Table 1). H.2 Translation We present experimental results of the translation tasks on the WMT English-German and German- English datasets in Figure 3. We train on WMT18 (Europarl v7, Common Crawl corpus and News Commentary v13) and test on newstest 2015 datasets. The ﬁgures show similar trends to the results on the WMT en-cs dataset in Figure 1b. 30H.3 GLUE tasks Figure 4 presents the results comparing the sparsity patterns and the head conﬁgurations on the CoLA and MRPC tasks using the BERTBASE model. CoLA is a single-sentence classiﬁcation task, asking if a sentence is a grammatical English sentence. MRPC is a sentence-pair classiﬁcation task, where each example is a pair of sentences and the label indicates whether the sentences are semantically equivalent. 31",

A key, surprising finding is that sparse Transformers with only O(n) connections per attention layer (compared to n^2 in dense models) retain enough expressive power for universal approximation (Corollary 2).

Universal approximability is proven under two conditions: Assumption 1 specifies properties for sparsity patterns (self-attention, Hamiltonian path-like connectivity, and multi-hop global access within 's' layers) and Assumption 2 requires the probability map ρ to approximate hardmax. The proof sketch involves three steps: approximating continuous functions with piecewise constant ones, exactly representing piecewise constant functions with a modified sparse Transformer (using hardmax and piecewise linear activations) through carefully chosen positional embeddings, quantization, contextual mapping (sparse selective shift and all-max-shift operations), and value mapping, and finally approximating the modified Transformer with a standard sparse Transformer (using ReLU and ρ) while carefully bounding error accumulation across layers.",

Code can be found at https://github.com/hamed1375/Sp_Exphormer. 1 Introduction The predominant story of the last half-decade of machine learning has been the runaway success of Transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017), across domains from natural language processing (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2018; Zaheer et al., 2020) to computer vision (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) and, more recently, geometric deep learning (Dwivedi and Bresson, 2020; Kreuzer et al., 2021; Ying et al., 2021; Rampášek et al., 2022; Shirzad et al., 2023; Müller et al., 2023). Conventional (“full”) Transformers, however, have a time and memory complexity of O(nd2 + n2d), where n is the number of entities (nodes, in the case of graphs), and d is the width of the network. Many attempts have been made to make Transformers more efficient (see Tay et al. (2020) for a survey on efficient variants for sequence modeling). One major line of work involves sparsifying the attention mechanism, constraining attention from all O(n2) pairs to some smaller set of connections. For instance, for sequential data, BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020) constructs a sparse attention mechanism by combining sliding windows, Erd˝os-Rényi auxiliary graphs, and universal connectors. Similarly, for graph data, Exphormer (Shirzad et al., 2023) constructs a sparse interaction graph consisting of edges from the input graph, an overlay expander graph, and universal connections. We refer to such a network as a sparse attention network. Exphormer reduces each layer’s complexity from O(nd2 + n2d) to O((m + n)d2), where n is the number of nodes, m is the number of interaction edges in the sparse attention mechanism, and d is ∗Work done in part while at Google. 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024). arXiv:2411.16278v1  [cs.LG]  25 Nov 2024the hidden dimension or width. Even so, training is still very memory-intensive for medium to large scale graphs. Also, for densely-connected input graphs with Θ(n2) edges, there is no asymptotic improvement in complexity, as Exphormer uses all of theΘ(n2) edges of the original input graph. Our goal is to scale efficient graph Transformers, such as Exphormer, to even larger graphs. One general approach for scaling models to larger graphs is based on batching techniques. Prominent approaches include egocentric subgraphs and random node subsets (Wu et al., 2022, 2023, 2024). Egocentric subgraphs choose a node and include all of its k-hop neighbors; the expander graphs used in Exphormer, however, are exactly defined so that the size of these subgraphs grows exponentially in the number of layers – prohibitively expensive for larger graphs. A similar issue arises with universally-connected nodes, whose representation depends on all other nodes. For uniformly- random subset batching, as the number b of batches into which the graph is divided grows, each edge has chance 1 b to appear in a given step. Thus, b cannot be very large without dropping important edges. A similar problem can happen in random neighbor sampling methods such as GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017). Although this model works well on message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) which only use the graph edges, using it for expander-augmented graphs will select only a small ratio of the expander edges, thereby breaking the universality properties provided by the expander graph. Expander graphs enable global information propagation, and when created with Hamiltonian cycles and self-loops, produce a model that can provably approximate a full Transformer (Shirzad et al., 2023, Theorem E.3). Yet not all of these edges turn out to be important in practice: we expect some neighboring nodes in the updated graph to have more of an effect on a given node than others. Thus, removing low-impact neighbors can improve the scalability of the model. The challenge is to identify low-impact edges without needing to train the (too-expensive) full model. Figure 1 illustrates other advantages of this batching approach; this is also discussed further in Appendix G. One approach is to train a smaller network to identify which edges are significant. It is not obvious a priori that attention scores learned from the smaller network will estimate those in the larger network, but we present an experimental study verifying that attention scores are surprisingly consistent as the network size reduces. We also give theoretical indications that narrow networks are capable of expressing the same attention scores as wider networks of the same architecture. Our approach. We first train a small-width network in order to estimate pairwise attention score patterns, which we then use to sparsify the graph and train a larger network. We first train the graphs without edge attributes. This reduces the complexity of Exphormer to O(md + nd2) and then by training a much smaller width ds ≪ d network, reduces the time and memory complexity by at least a factor of d/ds. We also introduce two additions to the model to improve this consistency. Training this initial network can still be memory-intensive, but as the small width implies the matrix multiplications are small, it is practical to train this initial model on a CPU node with sufficient RAM (typically orders of magnitude larger than available GPU memory), without needing to use distributed computation. Once this initial model is trained, the attention scores can be used in creating a sparse graph, over which we train the second network. These initial attention scores can be used as edge features for the second network. As mentioned previously, we use the attention scores obtained from the trained low-width network to sparsify the graph. By selecting a fixed number c of edges per attention layer for each node, we reduce the complexity of each layer to O(nd2 + ndc). This sparsification alleviates the effect of a large number of edges, and allows for initial training with a larger degree expander graph, since most of the expander edges will be filtered for the final network. This sparsification differs from conventional graph sparsification algorithms (for MPNNs) in three ways. First, we use expander edges, self-loops, and graph edges and sparsify the combination of these patterns together. Second, this sparsification is layer-wise, which means that in a multi-layer network the attention pattern will vary from layer to layer. Finally, our sampling uses a smaller network trained on the same task, identifying important neighbors based on the task, instead of approaches independent of the task such as sampling based on PageRank or a neighbor’s node degree. Another advantage of this approach is that the fixed number of neighbors for each node enables regular matrix calculations instead of the edge-wise calculations used by Kreuzer et al. (2021); Shirzad et al. (2023), greatly improving the speed of the model. After this reduction, batching can be done based on the edges over different layers, enabling Transformers to be effectively batched while still effectively approximating the main Transformer model, enabling modeling long-range dependencies. In batching large graphs, naive implementations of sampling without replacement from 2(a) (b) (d) (e) (f) (c) Figure 1: Figure (a) shows a very simple synthetic graph where each node has a binary classification task of determining whether there exists a node of the opposite color in the same connected component. This task requires learning long-range dependencies. Figure (b) shows a natural clustering of the graph. This clustering would mean no node can do its task if models are trained only on one cluster at a time. Figure (c) shows a neighbor sampling starting from the green node, where random sampling fails to select the single important edge that bridges to the different-colored nodes. Figure (d) shows a random subset sampling strategy, where the task is solvable if and if only the two sides of the bridge between the two colors get selected. If we increase the size of each cluster, while keeping just one edge between two colors, the probability of selecting the bridge in any batch goes to zero, and thus the training will fail in this scenario. (e) shows attention scores between the nodes if trained with an attention-based network. Dashed lines have near zero attention scores, and thicker lines indicate a larger attention score. Knowing these attention scores will mean each node with just one directional edge can do the task perfectly. The attention edges are shown in (f). In case two nodes are equally informative; selecting either of them leads to the correct result. attention edges with varying weights can be very slow. This is especially true if the attention scores are highly concentrated on a small number of neighbors for most of the nodes. We use reservoir sampling (Efraimidis and Spirakis, 2006), enabling parallel sampling with an easy, efficient GPU implementation, improving the sampling process significantly. We only use the Transformer part of the Exphormer model, not the dual MPNN+Transformer architecture used by Shirzad et al. (2023); Rampášek et al. (2022). Unlike the Exphormer approach, we do not assume that the expander graph is of degree O(1); we can see this as interpolating between MPNNs and full Transformers, where smaller degree expander graphs mostly rely on the graph edges and are more similar to MPNNs, while higher degree expander graphs can resemble full attention, in the most extreme case of degree n − 1 exactly recovering a full Transformer. To summarize, the contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) We experimentally and theoretically analyze the similarity of attention scores for networks of different widths, and propose two small architectural changes to improve this similarity. 2) We propose layer-wise sparsification, by sampling according to the learned attention scores, and do theoretical analysis on the sparsification guarantees of the attention pattern. 3) Our two-phase training process allows us to scale Transformers to larger datasets, as it has significantly smaller memory consumption, while maintaining competitive accuracy. 2 Related Work Graph Transformer Architectures. Attention mechanisms were proposed in early (message- passing) Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures such as Graph Attention Networks (GAT) (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2018), where they guide node aggregation among neighbors, without using positional encodings. GraphBert (Zhang et al., 2020) finds node encodings based on the underlying graph structure. Subsequent work has proposed full-fledged graph Transformer models that generalize sequence Transformers (Dwivedi and Bresson, 2020) and are not limited to message passing between nodes of the input graph; these include Spectral Attention Networks (SAN) (Kreuzer et al., 2021), Graphormer (Ying et al., 2021), GraphiT (Mialon et al., 2021), etc. GraphGPS (Ram- pášek et al., 2022) combines attention mechanisms with message passing, allowing the best of both worlds. 3Efficient Graph Transformers. Several recent works have proposed various scalable graph trans- former architectures. NAGphormer (Chen et al., 2022a) and Gophormer (Zhao et al., 2021) use a sampling-based approach. On the other hand, Difformer (Wu et al., 2023) proposes a continuous time diffusion-based transformer model. Exphormer (Shirzad et al., 2023) proposes a sparse graph that combines the input graph with edges of an expander graph as well as virtual nodes. They show that their model works better than applying other sparse Transformer methods developed for sequences. Another work, NodeFormer (Wu et al., 2022), which is inspired by Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), uses the Gumbel-Softmax operator as a kernel to efficiently propagate information among all pairs of nodes. SGFormer (Wu et al., 2024) shows that just using a one layer transformer network can sometimes improve the results of GCN-based networks and the low memory footprint can help scale to large networks. Perhaps most conceptually similar to our work is Skeinformer (Chen et al., 2022b), which uses sketching techniques to accelerate self-attention. Sampling and batching techniques. Some sampling-based methods have been used to alleviate the problem of “neighborhood explosion.” For instance, sampling was used in GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017), which used a fixed-size sample from a neighborhood in the node aggregation step. GraphSAINT (Zeng et al., 2020) scales GCNs to large graphs by sampling the training graph to create minibatches. Other. Expander graphs were used in convolutional networks by Prabhu et al. (2018). 3 Preliminaries and Notation Exphormer. EXPHORMER is an expander-based sparse attention mechanism for graph transformers that uses O(|V | + |E|) computation, where G = (V, E) is the underlying input graph. Exphormer creates an interaction graph H that consists of three main components: edges from the input graph, an overlaid expander graph, and virtual nodes (which are connected to all the original nodes). For the expander graph component, Exphormer uses a constant-degree random expander graph, with O(n) edges. Expander graphs have several useful theoretical properties related to spectral approximation and random walk mixing, which allow the propagation of information between pairs of nodes that are distant in the input graph G without explicitly connecting all pairs of nodes. The expander edges introduce many alternative short paths between the nodes and avoid the information bottleneck that can be caused by the virtual nodes. Our model. We use H to denote the attention pattern, and NH(i) the neighbors of node i under that pattern. Let X = (x1, x2, . . . ,xn) ∈ Rd×n be the matrix of d-dimensional embeddings for all of the n nodes. Our primary “driver” is then h-head attention: using ⊙ for element-wise multiplication, ATTN H(X):,i = xi + hX j=1 Vj i · σ \u0010\u0000 Ej ⊙ Kj\u0001T Qj i + Bj \u0011 , where Vj i = Wj V XNH(i), K = Wj KXNH(i), and Qj i = Wj Qxi, are linear mappings of the node features for the neighbors XNH(i), and Ej = Wj EENH(i) and Bj = Wj BENH(i) are linear maps of the edge features E, which is a dE × |NH(i)| matrix of features for the edges coming in to node i. Exphormer uses learnable edge features for each type of added edge, and original edge features for the graph’s edges. If the graph does not have any original edge features, it uses a learnable edge feature across all graph edges. Edge features help the model distinguish the type of attention edges. Here, σ is an activation function. In both Exphormer and our work the activation function is ReLU. In the absence of edge features, which is the case for most of the transductive datasets, including the datasets that have been used in this paper, Ee for any attention edge e can have one of three possible representations, and so Ej can be computed more simply by first mapping these three types of edge features with Wj E for head j, and then replacing the mapped values for each edge type. This simple change reduces the complexity of the Exphormer from O(md2 + nd2) to O(md + nd2). Compared to prior work, we introduce Bj as a simpler route for the model to adjust the importance of different edge types. Considering Exphormer as an interpolation between MPNNs and full Transformers, the Bj model has an easier path to allow for attention scores to be close to zero for all non-graph attention edges, without restricting the performance of the attention mechanism on 4graph edges. Consequently, it can function roughly as an MPNN (similar to GAT) by zeroing out the non-local attention paths. We use dE = d, and have each layer output features of the same width as its input, so that each of the Wj · parameter matrices except for Wj B are d × d, and Wj B is d × 1. As a simple illustration that Ej is insufficient to allow near-zero attention scores, thus highlighting the importance of Bj, note that if the columns of K and Q are distributed independently and uniformly on a unit ball (e.g., under a random initialization), there is no vector Ej which is identical for all edges of an expander graph that can make the attention scores for all the expander edges near-zero. Our network compared to Exphormer. We use Exphormer as the base model because it provides us the flexibility to adjust the sparsity of the attention graph and to interpolate between MPNNs and full Transformers. Exphormer can model many long-range dependencies that are not modeled by MPNNs and are very expensive to model in a full Transformer. For example, one cannot train a full Transformer model in the memory of a conventional GPU device for a dataset such as Physics, which has a graph on just 34K nodes. In our instantiation of Exphormer, we add self-loops for every node and use d/2 random Hamiltonian cycles to construct our expander graph as described in (Shirzad et al., 2023, Appendix C.2). We do not add virtual nodes in our networks. (Even so, the resulting network is still a universal approximator; Shirzad et al., 2023, Theorem E.3). Although the best known results for Exphormer combine sparse attention with MPNNs, in this work, we avoid the MPNN component for scalability reasons. We also make two additional changes; see Section 4. 4 Method Our method consists of a two-phase training process. The first phase trains a model we call the Attention Score Estimator Network, whose goal is to estimate the attention scores for a larger network. This model is not particularly accurate; its only goal is for each node to learn which neighbors are most important. The learned attention scores for each layer of the first network are then used to construct sparse interaction graphs for each layer in a second model, which is trained (with hyperparameter tuning for the best results) and serves as the final predictor. Attention Score Estimator Network. For this network, we use a width of 4 or 8, with just one attention head, in our training. We tune the other hyperparameters in order to have a converged training process with reasonably high accuracy, but we do not spend much time optimizing this network as it is sufficient to learn the important neighbors for each node, i.e., edges with high attention scores. This network will be trained with as many layers as the final network we want to train. Because it is so narrow, it has many fewer parameters and hence much less memory and time complexity, making it cheaper to train. Moreover, we only need to do this training once per number of layers we consider, conditioned on the fact that the training converges, even if the final model has a large number of hyperparameters. Compared to Exphormer, we use a much higher-degree expander graph: 30 to 200 instead of the 6 used for most transductive graphs by Shirzad et al. (2023). As most of the considered datasets do not have edge features, we use a learnable embedding for each type of edge (graph edge, expander edge, or self-loop). We also make two small changes to the architecture and the training process of this model, discussed below. Section 5.1 shows experimentally that the low-width network is a good estimator of the attention scores for a large-width network. Normalizing V . Having a smaller attention score, αij < αij′ , does not necessarily mean that j’s contribution to i’s new features is smaller than that of j′: if ∥Vj∥ ≫ ∥Vj′ ∥, the net contribution of j could be larger. Although Transformers typically use layer normalization, they do not typically do so after mapping X to V. We normalize the rows of V to have the same vector sizes for all nodes. In our experiments, normalizing to size one reduced performance significantly; however, adding a learnable global scale s, so that Vi becomes sVi ||Vi||2 , maintained performance while making attention scores more meaningful. Variable Temperature One of the side goals is to have sharper attention scores, guiding the nodes to get their information from as few nodes as possible. Using temperature in the attention mechanism can do this, where logits will be divided by a temperature factor τ before being fed into a softmax. Normal attention corresponds to τ = 1; smaller τ means sharper attention scores. However, setting the temperature to a small value from the beginning will make the random initialization more significant, and increase the randomness in the training process. Instead, we start with τ = 1.0 and gradually anneal it to 0.05 by the end of the training.

(a) The attention mechanism for the attention score estimator network combines graph edges with an expander graph and self-loops. The expander graphs are constructed by combining a small number of Hamiltonian cycles – here two, in red and in purple – then confirming the spectral gap is large enough. (b) Self-attention layers in the estimator network use this sparse attention mechanism; its self-attention layers normalize V. (c, d) Attention scores are extracted from this network for each layer, and used to sample, in (e), a sparse directed graph, which becomes the attention graph for the final network (f). This network, with a much larger feature dimension, does not normalize V. where we use τ = 1; this lets the model learn which neighbors are more important for each node slowly. We multiply τ with a factor γ after each epoch, obtaining a temperature in epoch t > λof max(γt−λ, 0.05). We use λ = 5 and γ = 0.99 or 0.95 depending on how fast the learning converges. Sparser Attention Pattern. The memory and time complexity of Exphormer is linearly dependent on the number of edges. Also, with a small number of layers, the expander degree should be high enough to ensure a large enough receptive field for each node in order to learn the long-range dependencies. Not all these edges are equally important, and many of them will have a near-zero effect on the final embedding of each node. Reducing the number of edges can alleviate memory consumption. Additionally, a sparser pattern lets us use batching techniques for the larger graphs. In this work, we analyze how effectively the sparser model can work and up to what factor we can sparsify. For each layer, e.g., ℓ, we select a degℓ as a fixed degree for each node and sample without replacement according to the attention score estimator network’s attention scores in each epoch of training or evaluation. Having the same degree for each node’s attention pattern also means that attention can be calculated using (much-more-optimized) standard matrix multiplications, rather than the propagation techniques used in Exphormer and SAN (Kreuzer et al., 2021). To sparsify the graph, in each epoch, we sample a new set of edges according to the learned attention scores from the smaller network. The reason why we do this rather than a simpler strategy such as selecting top-scored edges is that in many cases, several nodes can have very similar node features. If we assume nodes u1, u2, . . . , up from the neighbors of node v have almost the same features, and if the attention scores for these nodes are α1, α2, . . . , αp, any linear combination of Pp i=1 αi = α will lead to the same representation for node v. If features are exactly the same, α will be divided between these nodes, and even if α is large, each node’s attention score from v can be small. By sampling, we have a total α chance of selecting any of the nodes u1:p. In each epoch, we re-sample a new set of edges for each node from its original neighborhood. Faster Sampling Using Reservoir Sampling. Sampling without replacement using default li- brary calls is very slow, especially if few neighbors dominate the attention scores. We instead use reservoir sampling (Efraimidis and Spirakis, 2006), which is GPU-friendly and parallelizable. For reservoir sampling of k neighbors from the neighborhood of node i, with attention scores a = ( a1, a2, ··· , a|NH(i)|), we first take a uniform random sample u = ( u1, u2, ··· , u|NH(i)|), where the ui are i.i.d. samples from Uniform(0, 1). Then we calculate 1 a ⊙log(u) with element-wise 6multiplication, and select the indices with the top k values from this list. Selecting k-th rank from n values and pivoting has a worst-case O(n) time algorithm, which is much faster than the O(nk) worst case time for trial-and-error. Pseudocode is given in Algorithm 1. The GPU-friendly version of this can be implemented by sampling for nodes in parallel, but requires forming a regular matrix for the attention scores. This can be done by extending each attention score vector to the maximum degree, or selecting a value k′ ≫ k and first sampling k′ and selecting the top k′ attention scores from each node, making sure that the sum of the rest of the neighbor’s attention scores are very near to zero. Then by forming a rectangular attention matrix, uniform sampling and element-wise multiplications are much faster on GPU, and sampling from the entire batch is much more efficient. Algorithm 1 Reservoir Sampling from a Node’s Neighborhood Input: Attention scores a = a(ℓ) i,NH(i), number of neighbors to sample: degℓ Output: List of degℓ neighbors of node i 1: function RESERVOIR SAMPLE (a, degℓ) 2: u ∼ Uniform(0, 1)|NH(i)| 3: return argtopdegℓ(1 a ⊙ log(u)) 4: end function Batching. Each batch starts with a random subset of “target” nodes B. These are the nodes whose last-layer representations we will update in this optimization step. To calculate these representations, we need keys and values based on the previous layer’s representations for the relevant neighbors of each target node (again, sampling neighbors from the graph augmented by an expander graph). To approximate this, we sample degL neighbors for each target node. Then we have a set of at most |B|(degL +1) nodes whose representations we need to calculate in layerL−1; we repeat this process, so that in layer ℓ we need to compute representations for up toQ(ℓ) ≤ min(|B|QL i=ℓ+1(degi +1), n) query nodes, with |Q(ℓ)|degℓ attention edges. Pseudocode is given in Algorithm 2. When the number of layers L and degree degℓ are not too large, this batching can be substantially more efficient than processing the entire graph. Moreover, compared to other batching techniques, our approach selects neighbors according to their task importance. Except for optimization dynamics in the training process corresponding to minibatch versus full-batch training, training with batches is identical to training with the entire sparsified graph; if we choose a large degℓ equal to the maximum degree of the augmented graph, this is exactly equivalent to SGD on the full graph, without introducing any biases in the training procedure. This is in stark contrast to previous approaches, as illustrated in Figure 1. Unlike these prior approaches, which typically use the full graph at inference time, we can run inference with batch size as small as one (trading off memory for computation). Algorithm 2 Neighborhood Sampling for a Batch of Nodes Input: Attention scores in each layer: a = n a(ℓ) i,j | ∀i ∈ V, j∈ NH(i), ,1 ≤ ℓ ≤ L o , number of neighbors to sample in each layer: deg = {deg1, ··· , degL}, and a batch of nodes B ⊆ V Output: Q(ℓ), K(ℓ), V(ℓ), query, key, and value nodes in each layer 1: function SAMPLE NEIGHBORHOOD (B, a, deg) 2: V(L+1) ← B 3: for ℓ ← L to 1 do 4: Q(ℓ) ← V(ℓ+1) 5: for i ← i ∈ Q(ℓ) do 6: K(ℓ) i ← RESERVOIR SAMPLE (ai,NH(i), degℓ) 7: end for 8: K(ℓ) ← S i∈Qℓ K(ℓ) i 9: V(ℓ) ← Q(ℓ) SK(ℓ) 10: end for 11: return \b\u0000 V(ℓ), Q(ℓ), K(ℓ)\u0001 | 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ L \t 12: end function 7Fixed Node Degree Layers. Sparse matrix operations are not yet nearly as efficient as dense operations on GPU devices. Exphormer and SAN use a gather operation, which is memory-efficient but not time-efficient on a GPU (Zaheer et al., 2020). By normalizing the degree, instead of having |Q(ℓ)|degℓ separate dot products between the query and key vectors, we can reshape the key vectors to be of size |Q(ℓ)| ×degℓ ×d and the query is of shape |Q(ℓ)| ×d. Now the dot product of query and key mappings can be done using |Q(ℓ)|, degℓ ×d by d × 1 matrix multiplications. This same size matrix multiplication can be done using highly optimized batch matrix multiplication operations in e.g. PyTorch and Tensorflow (Paszke et al., 2019; Abadi et al., 2015). 4.1 Theoretical Underpinnings We first study the approximability of a network with a smaller hidden dimension or width. Formally, suppose that the width of a wide network is D. Then there exists a network with narrow dimensions for WQ and WK, of dimension O(log n ε2 ) × D instead of D × D, whose attention scores agree with those of the wide network up to O(ε) error (Theorem E.4). This reduction helps with the most intensive part of the calculation; others are linear with respect to the number of nodes n. While this is not the model we use in practice, Shirzad et al. (2024, Section 4) explore some scenarios common in graph Transformers that allow for the existence of “fully” narrow networks with accurate attention scores. They support these claims with experiments that show compressibility for some datasets we use. This is an existence claim; we will justify experimentally that in practice, training a narrow network does approximate attention scores well. We then study the sampling procedure of our sparsification method. Under certain assumptions, we show that sampling roughly O(n log n/ε2) entries of the attention matrix A (corresponding to sampling this many edges in the graph) suffices to form a matrix B with ∥A − B∥2 ≤ ε∥A∥2, if we can access the entries of A (Theorem E.5). We cannot actually access the matrix A, but we do have attention scores A′ from a narrow network. We show that if the entries ofA are not seriously under-estimated by A′, the same bound on the number of samples still holds (Proposition E.7).

To this end, we use the Actor (Lim et al., 2021) and Photo (Shchur et al., 2018) datasets. We train the network for hidden dimensions h varying from 4 to 64 for both datasets. For each h we train the network 100 times. We consider the distribution of attention scores for each node, and estimate the energy distance (Székely and Rizzo, 2013; an instance of the maximum mean discrepancy, Sejdinovic et al., 2013) for that node’s attention scores across each pair of h sizes. 8uniformrandom 4 8 16 32 64 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 Actor Dataset without Expanders (a) uniformrandom 4 8 16 32 64 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 Actor Dataset with Expanders (b) uniformrandom 4 8 16 32 64 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 Amazon-Photo Dataset without Expanders (c) uniformrandom 4 8 16 32 64 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 Amazon-Photo Dataset with Expanders (d) Figure 3: Energy distance between the attention scores of various networks to a network of width 64. “Uniform” refers to the baseline placing equal scores to each neighbor, while “random” refers to the baseline with uniformly distributed logits. The remaining bars refer to networks trained on the appropriately labeled width. We ran this experiment in two scenarios: first, with just graph edges, and then, by adding expander and self-loop edges. It might be that the model, just by examining the category of the edges, may give a lower score to one type, making distributions seem more similar despite not identifying a small number of important neighbors as we want. However, in the presence of only one type of edge, the model can still consistently estimate which nodes should have a higher attention score. We compare attention scores from our model with the uniform distribution on the neighbors (each neighbor of node i has score 1 di ), and to a distribution with logits uniform over [−8, 8]. The choice of 8 here is because in the network we clip the logits with an absolute value higher than8. Figure 3 shows that even width-4 networks provide far superior estimates of attention scores than these baselines. In Appendix F, we extend our analysis with several experiments: examining pairwise energy distances between all pairs of hidden dimensions as well as uniform and random distributions, providing layer- wise results (Appendix F.2), analyzing the sharpness or smoothness of attention scores across layers (Appendix F.3), assessing their similarity between layers (Appendix F.4), and measuring precision, recall, density, and coverage in estimating the attention scores of the larger network using a smaller one (Appendix F.5). Additionally, we investigate the sum of top-k attention scores (Appendix F.6) and evaluate the role of different edge types in learning representations (Appendix F.7). Our key insights are as follows: Insight 1.Attention scores from a network with a smaller hidden dimension serve as a good estimator for the attention scores in a network with a higher hidden dimension. Insight 2.Attention scores are smoother in the first layer, and become sharper in subsequent layers. Insight 3.The attention scores in the layers after the first are consistently very similar to one another, but distinct from the attention scores in the first layer. Insight 4.The sum of the top-k attention scores is substantially lower than one for many nodes, even for relatively large k values such as 10.

For the CS, Physics, Photo, and Computer datasets, we use a random train/validation/test split of 60%/20%/20%. For WikiCS and ogbn-arxiv we follow the standard data split provided by the original source. For the Actor dataset, we use a 50%/25%/25% split following Wu et al. (2022). For the Minesweeper, Tolokers, Roman-empire, Amazon-ratings, and Questions datasets, we use the standard split from Platonov et al. (2023). Results for these experiments are provided in Tables 1 and 2. The EXPHORMER model presented in the tables refers to the attention mechanism of EXPHORMER without incorporating any MPNN components. Interestingly, the results on the Roman-Empire and Amazon-Ratings datasets revealed that removing certain edges led to better performance compared to simply adding an expander layout. In these medium-sized datasets, we are able to train the full Exphormer model. Our goal is to determine the extent of performance reduction when using two memory-efficient networks to estimate the original network. Results show that the two memory-efficient networks can efficiently estimate the original network, enabling us to scale the Exphormer to larger graph datasets. We compare the maximum required memory of the attention score estimator and final networks with that of the corresponding Exphormer model in Figure 4. We then experiment on large graph datasets: ogbn-proteins, Amazon2M (Hu et al., 2021), and Pokec (Takac and Zabovsky, 2012). The results provided in Table 3 demonstrate superior performance of our model despite limited memory constraints. We follow the standard data split for the ogbn-proteins dataset and follow Wu et al. (2024) for the dataset split on the Amazon2M and Pokec datasets, with 10%/10%/80% and 50%/25%/25% train/validation/test ratios. We emphasize that this split differs from the original dataset split used by many other works, making those numbers incomparable. In all our experiments, we train the smaller network once, and then for the second network, we always use the same initial network’s learned attention scores. Attention scores are collected from the network training step with the highest validation accuracy. We use a subset of the following models in each of our tables as baselines, depending on the type of the dataset and scalability level of the models, GCN (Kipf and Welling, 2016), GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017), GAT (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2018), GraphSAINT (Zeng et al., 2020), Nodeformer (Wu et al., 2022), Difformer (Wu et al., 2023), SGFormer (Wu et al., 2024), GraphGPS (Rampášek et al., 2022), GOAT (Kong et al., 2023), GloGNN (Li et al., 2022), SGC (Wu et al., 2019), NAGphormer (Chen et al., 2022a), Exphormer (Shirzad et al., 2023), and SIGN (Frasca et al., 2020). We borrow most of the baseline numbers in the tables from Wu et al. (2024); Deng et al. (2024). 10Table 4: Ablation studies on two homophilic and two heterophilic datasets.

Spexphormer-uniform, rather than sampling based on the estimated attention scores, samples uniformly from the augmented graph; this is always worse than attention-based sampling, but the gap is larger for some datasets than others. Spexphormer-max takes the edges with the highest attention scores, rather than sampling; this again performs somewhat worse across datasets. Spexphormer w.o. temp uses a constant temperature of 1 in the initial attention score estimator network; Spexphormer w.o. layer norm removes our added layer normalization. These changes are smaller, and in one case layer normalization makes the results worse. Across the four datasets, however, it seems that both temperature and layer norm help yield more informative and sparser attention scores. 6 Conclusion & Limitations We analyzed the alignment of the attention scores among models trained with different widths. We found that the smaller network’s attention score distributions usually align well with the larger network’s. We also theoretically analyzed the compressibility of the larger Graph Transformer models. Based on these observations, we used a sampling algorithm to sparsify the graph on each layer. As a result of these two steps, the model’s memory consumption reduces significantly, while achieving a competitive accuracy. This strategy also lets us use novel batching techniques that were not feasible with expander graphs of a large degree. Having a regular degree enables using dense matrix multiplication, which is far more efficient with current GPU and TPU devices. While our method successfully scales to datasets with over two million nodes, it relies on large CPU memory for the attention score estimation for these datasets. For extremely large datasets, this is still infeasible without highly distributed computation. Estimated attention scores can be shared and used for training various networks based on attention scores, however, so this only needs to only be computed once per dataset and depth. An area for potential future work is to combine sampling with simultaneous attention score estimation in a dynamic way, scaling this estimation to larger graphs.

The node features are the average of the word embeddings from the articles. The task is to classify the nodes into ten different branches of the field. Actor dataset The actor dataset is created by the actor-only subgraph of a larger graph of actor, director, writer, and film co-occuring on a Wikipedia page, limited to English-language films. Each node corresponds to an actor. Edges denote co-occurence on a Wikipedia page. Node features are based on the terms in the actor’s page. The prediction task is categorizing into one of five categories (Pei et al., 2020). 15Roman-Empire This dataset is a graph constructed from the “Roman Empire” article from Wikipedia. Each node is a word from this text. Two words are connected to each other if they follow each other in the text, or they are connected in the dependency tree of the sentence. The task is to predict the syntactic role of the word in the sentence. Graph is highly sparse and heterophilic. Coauthor datasets The datasets, CS and Physics are co-authorship graphs from Microsoft Aca- demic Graph. The nodes represent the authors and an edge connects two authors who share a paper. The node features are the keywords in the papers. The class represents the active area of study for the author. ogbn-arxiv (Hu et al., 2021) The ogbn-arxiv dataset is from OGBN datasets. The nodes represents the papers and edges represent the citations between the papers. Nodes are 128-dimensional feature vector that is an average of the embeddings of words in the title and abstract. The prediction task is to identify the category of the 40 subject areas. ogbn-proteins dataset The ogbn-proteins dataset is an undirected graph with edge weights and types based on species. The nodes represent proteins from eight different species. Edges indicate various biologically meaningful associations between the proteins (e.g., co-expression, homology etc.). The edges are eight-dimensional, with each dimension having a value from [0,1] indicates the confidence score. The prediction task is a multi-label binary classification among 112 labels — to predict the presence of protein functions. The performance measurement is the average of ROC-AUC scores across the 112 tasks. Minesweeper The dataset is a graph representation of the 100x100 grid from the Minesweeper game. A node represents a cell and the edges connect a node to its eight neighboring cells. 20% of the nodes are marked as mines. The features of the nodes are the one-hot encoding of the mines among the neighbors. For 50% of the nodes the features are unknown and indicated by a separate binary feature. Tolokers Tolokers is a graph representation of the workers in a crowd-sourcing platform, called Toloka. Each node represents a worker. Two nodes are connected if the workers have worked on the same task. Node features are based on the worker’s task performance statistics and other profile information. The task is to predict which nodes have been banned for a project.

The task is to predict user activity status at the end of the period. Pokec Pokec is a large-scale social network dataset. Nodes represents users of the network. Nodes features include profile data like geographical region, age etc. The task is to predict the gender of users based on the graph. C More Experiments C.1 Time-Memory Trade-off One advantage of our method is its ability to trade time for memory without sacrificing accuracy. Figure 5 illustrates this trade-off on two datasets: ogbn-proteins and arxiv. In these experiments, all hyperparameters are kept constant, with the only variation being the batch size. The results demonstrate that memory usage and runtime can be adjusted without introducing bias into the training process. It is important to note that in random subset batching, the average degree of nodes and the number of edges included in the training process are closely related to the batch size. A very small batch size relative to the graph size can randomly exclude a significant portion of the graph’s edges during training, potentially ignoring critical edges without considering their importance. 16Table 6: Dataset statistics. The reported number of edges is the number of directed edges, which will be twice the number of actual edges for the undirected graphs.

The plot demon- strates that memory and time can be effectively exchanged in our approach. The reported runtime includes the whole process of preprocessing the batches, train, and validation on validation and test sets. All experiments were conducted on a V100 GPU with 32GB of memory. C.2 Neighborhood Expansion The level of neighborhood expansion significantly impacts the efficiency of our model. As described in Algorithm 2, neighborhood expansion begins from the final nodes for which we require representations in the final layer and proceeds backward through the layers, sampling neighbors based on attention scores at each layer. We analyze the number of nodes across four datasets: Amazon-Photo, Coauthor-CS, Minesweeper, and Tolokers, to observe how the number of nodes increases as we trace back through the layers. This experiment is conducted with varying sampling degrees per layer, and the results are summarized in Figure 6. In all experiments, we assume that representations are needed for 10 final nodes. We sample 100 times of these 10 random seed nodes and plot average and standard deviations of the neighborhood node counts. The process has an upper bound, which is the total number of nodes in the graph. As the number of sampled nodes approaches this limit, the likelihood of encountering new nodes decreases. We compare these results with full-neighborhood sampling methods, as employed in k-hop neighborhood-induced subgraph techniques, and demonstrate that in the presence of expander graphs, this neighborhood can rapidly encompass the entire graph. The impact of limited neighborhood sampling becomes even more pronounced on extremely large graphs. 174 3 2 1 0 Layer Number 0 2000 4000 6000 8000Number of Nodes Dataset: Amazon-Photo 4 3 2 1 0 Layer Number 0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 30000 35000Number of Nodes Dataset: Coauthor-Physics 4 3 2 1 0 Layer Number 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000Number of Nodes Dataset: Minesweeper 4 3 2 1 0 Layer Number 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000Number of Nodes Dataset: Tolokers degree = 1 degree = 3 degree = 5 degree = 10 Full Neighborhood Figure 6: The neighborhood expansion of the graph is analyzed to determine the number of nodes required in each layer to obtain representations for 10 nodes in the final layer. This is compared between Spexphormer’s degree-based sampling and full-neighborhood selection. The shadowed regions in the plot represent the 95% confidence intervals, calculated from 100 iterations of sampling the ten final nodes. C.3 Memory and Runtime with Graph Size Inspired by Finkelshtein et al. (2024), we compare the memory and runtime of our method to a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) during a forward pass. In many real-world scenarios, the average degree of nodes is not constant and tends to scale with the graph size. One advantage of our method is its ability to subsample neighborhoods for each node, identifying a small yet representative set of neighbors. While GCN is a more computationally efficient network, we demonstrate that, even with a small but superlinear growth in neighborhood size, the memory and runtime requirements of GCN can surpass those of our method, which employs a sparse but regular self-attention layer with a fixed neighborhood size. In these experiments, we evaluate different growth factors for the GCN and varying neighborhood sampling sizes for our sparse self-attention method. For these comparisons, no batching is used; the entire process operates on the whole graph. Both models consist of a single layer of the corresponding network followed by a linear layer that maps the values to dimension 1. We use a hidden dimension of 128. In this setup, the GCN has approximately 16K parameters, while the self-attention layer in our method has about 65K parameters. We vary the number of nodes from10K to 50K, using an Erd˝os-Rényi distribution with specified probabilities p, denoted as ER(n, p). Here, n represents the number of nodes, and p is the probability that any pair of nodes is independently connected. In the GCN model input, p varies with n and can also be viewed as a function of n. The average degree of a node in this model is pn. For the Spexphormer model, we sample d-regular graphs as input. Node features are drawn from N(0, I128), where I128 is the 128-dimensional identity matrix. 18The results, shown in Figure 7, indicate that except for a constant average degree in the GCN model, the memory and runtime growth rates are higher for the GCN under all other configurations. For sufficiently large and dense graphs, our method proves to be significantly more efficient in both memory and runtime. 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Number of Nodes (×1000) 0 1 2 3 4 5Memory Usage (GB) Spexphormer, d=5 Spexphormer, d=10 Spexphormer, d=20 GCN, p = 20 n GCN, p = 4log n n GCN, p = 1 4 n GCN, p = 0.002 (a) 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Number of Nodes (×1000) 0.0 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5 20.0Runtime (ms) Spexphormer, d=5 Spexphormer, d=10 Spexphormer, d=20 GCN, p = 20 n GCN, p = 4log n n GCN, p = 1 4 n GCN, p = 0.002 (b) Figure 7: The memory and runtime comparison between our model and the GCN demonstrates that our model, with sparsification, significantly outperforms even a very simple GCN model on a forward pass. C.4 Accuracy, Memory, and Runtime with Sampling Degree For four datasets—Tolokers, Minesweeper, Amazon-Photo, and Coauthor-CS—we analyze how accuracy, memory usage, and runtime change as the sampling degree is varied. In this experiment, all hyperparameters are fixed except for the sampling degree degℓ, which is kept consistent across all layers to simplify the analysis. The results are shown in Figure 8, where we plot both the Accuracy/AUC results and the memory/runtime metrics. For more heterophilic datasets, larger neighborhood sampling generally improves performance; however, the improvement becomes marginal beyond a certain point, while memory usage and runtime continue to increase linearly. For homophilic datasets, a very small neighborhood size is sufficient, and increasing the neighborhood size further does not provide noticeable benefits. D Experiment Details D.1 Hyperparameters In our networks, we use a higher expander degree than what was used in the EXPHORMER paper. Since many of these edges will get a small attention score, a higher attention score increases the receptive field of the nodes, letting the final network be able to sample from wider options and have better access to long-range dependencies. We also noticed, the attention scores in the first layer are usually more flat than the other layers and so we usually sample more edges from the first attention layer. For the comparisons both on the results and the memory we have given the same expander degree to the Exphormer and the ogbn-arxiv dataset could barely fit into a 40GB GPU memory device with higher expander degree. For the attention score estimator network, we do not use dropout, and we only use one attention head in these networks. The number of layers is always equal between both networks. We use AdamW optimization algorithm in all our networks and use a cosine learning rate scheduler with it. We use weight decay of 1e −3 in all networks. We use layer norm in attention score estimator networks to keep attention scores more meaningful, but use a batch norm for better results in the final SPEXPHORMER model.

Larger sampling degrees generally lead to better results; however, for the homophilic datasets, even a very small neighborhood size can yield substantial performance. Increasing the sampling degree increases memory and runtime requirements accordingly. D.2 Hardware For all trainings of the medium-sized graph datasets and the final network training of the large-sized graphs, we used GPUs of type A100 with 40GB memory, and V100, both 32GB and 16GB versions. While these are powerful GPUs, we have always monitored the GPU memory usage for computational efficiency, ensuring that no more than 8GB is used for whole graph training and no more than 4GB of GPU memory is used with batching. Training with even less memory is feasible with smaller batch sizes. 20Table 7: Hyperparameters used for training the networks for homophilous datasets.

Except for the Amazon2M dataset, for the other datasets 200GB of memory would be sufficient. E Theory In this section, we theoretically analyze the compressibility of the Graph Transformer architecture and also sparsification guarantees using the attention score estimator network. For simplification, we use the following formulation of a single head Transformer network: h(ℓ+1/2) i = degiX j=1 a(l) ij V(ℓ) j , h(ℓ+1) i = W(ℓ) 2 \u0010 σ \u0010 W(ℓ) 1 \u0010 h(ℓ+1/2) i \u0011\u0011\u0011 , a(l) ij = exp \u0010 K(ℓ) j · Q(ℓ) i \u0011 P u∈NH(i) exp \u0010 K(ℓ) u · Q(ℓ) i \u0011, where, V(ℓ) = W(ℓ) V h(ℓ), Q(ℓ) = W(ℓ) Q h(ℓ), K(ℓ) = W(ℓ) K h(ℓ), and σ can be any 1-Lipchitz activation function, such as ReLU, which has been used in practice in our networks. We re- move the normalization parts from the architecture but assume that in all steps for all vectors, ∥Xi∥2, ∥h(ℓ+1/2) i ∥2, ∥h(ℓ) i ∥2 ≤ √α, and all linear mapping W· matrices’ operator norm is bounded by a constant β. The first assumption is realistic because of the layer-norm applied between the layers in real-world architectures. The second assumption is also justified as the operator norms are near 2 21Table 9: Hyperparameters used for training the networks for the large graphs datasets.

Also, we assume h(0) = X, which is the input features. For a simpler notation, we will use D for a hypothetical large network hidden dimension in this analysis, and d is the hidden dimension of the narrow network. For simplicity, in our analysis, we assume X ∈ Rn×D. In case each node has less than D features, we can concatenate them with zeros. E.1 On the Compressibility of the Graph Transformer Our approach uses a narrow network to estimate the attention scores. We want to show if we have a large network with good accuracy for a task on a graph, we can have a less complex network that can work on the same input graph and the error of this network is bounded by O(ε) from the large network. The most memory/time-intensive part of a Transformer architecture is its attention score calculation part. The rest of the sections are node/token-wise and linear with respect to the number of nodes. The attention score estimation part of a full-Transformer layer requires O(n2d) operations and O(md) operators are required for a sparse Transformer with m attention edges. In the main Exphormer network, this would also be more intensive as the edge features mappings requireO(md2) operations, but since we replace edge feature mappings with edge embeddings by their type, this part in case we do not have other edge features is O(md), but m still can be ω(n), and it will be the most computationally-intensive part. Assume we have a large network with L layers, where L is O(1), and hidden dimension D, we will show that there is a similar network with L layers where the attention score calculation matrices WQ, WK ∈ RD×d, and all other matrices are of the same size and d is O(CL log n ϵ2 ), where C is a constant based on α and β. For this proof we use the distributional Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform lemma (Johnson, 1984): Lemma E.1 (Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transform Lemma ( JLT)). Assume 0 < ϵ, δ <1 2 and any positive integer D, if d = O(log(1/δ) ϵ2 ), there exist a distribution over matrices M ∈ Rd×D that for any x ∈ RD and ∥x∥ = 1: Pr(∥Mx∥ −1 > ϵ) < δ The following corollary is an immediate conclusion from the JLT. Corollary E.2. Assume 0 < ϵ, δ <1 2 and any positive integer D, if d = O(log(1/δ) ε2 ), there exist a distribution over matrices M ∈ Rd×D that for any x, y∈ RD: 22Pr((1 − ε)∥x − y∥ < ∥Mx − My∥ < (1 + ε)∥x − y∥) < δ This can derived by replacing x from JLT with x−y ∥x−y∥. From this, we can derive another corollary about the dot product of the vectors in low-dimensional space. Corollary E.3 (JLT-dot product). Assume 0 < ϵ, δ <1 2 and any positive integer D, if d = O(log(1/δ) ε2 ), there exist a distribution over matrices M ∈ Rd×D that for any x, y∈ RD, and ∥x∥, ∥y∥ ≤√α: Pr((1 − εα)xTy < xTMTMy <(1 + εα)xTy) < δ For the proof see (Kakade and Shakhnarovich, 2009, Corollary 2.1). As a result of this corollary, if we have m pairs of vectors (xi, yi), and for each i ∥xi∥2, ∥yi∥2 ≤ √α of √α, and d = O(log(m) ε2 ), there exists an M such that for all these pairs |xT i MTMyi − xT i yi| < εα. The proof can be done using a union bound over the error from Corollary E.3. Also, in our case where m is the number of edges, we know that m ≤ n2, thus we can also say d = O(log(n) ε2 ). Theorem E.4. Assume we have a Transformer network T with arbitrary large hidden dimension D, L = O(1) layers, and in this network, in all layers, we have ∥h·∥2 ≤ √α, and ∥W·∥op ≤ β. There exists a Transformer bT , that for any layer WQ and WK are in Rd×D for a d = O(log n ε2 ), with a sufficiently small ε, and for all i ∈ [n], ∥T (X)i − bT (X)i∥2 = O(ε). And furthermore, for any attention score a(ℓ) ij ba(ℓ) ij = 1 + O(ε). Proof. In the proof we use hat notation, b□, for the vectors and matrices from bT , for example, ˆh(ℓ) are the outputs of layer ℓ, and cW· are the weight matrices for this network. In all layers for both networks WV , W1, and W2, are of the same size, so we set cWV = WV , cW1 = W1, and cW2 = W2. For the proof, we want to findε(0), ··· , ε(L) in a way that for anyv in layer ℓ, |h(ℓ) v −ˆh(ℓ) v | < ε(ℓ). We will find these bounds inductively, starting from the first layer. We haveε(0) = 0, as both networks have the same input, and we want to bound ε(ℓ+1) based on ε(ℓ). We have Q(ℓ) = W(ℓ) Q H(ℓ), K(ℓ) = W(ℓ) K H(ℓ) and assume ¯Q(ℓ) = W(ℓ) Q bH(ℓ), ¯K(ℓ) = W(ℓ) K bH(ℓ). Because of the operator norm of matricesWQ and WK, for each i we have ∥q(ℓ) i −¯q(ℓ) i ∥ ≤ε(ℓ)β and ∥k(ℓ) i − ¯k(ℓ) i ∥ ≤ε(ℓ)β. Also, we have ∥q(ℓ) i ∥, ∥k(ℓ) i ∥ ≤β√α, thus ∥¯q(ℓ) i ∥, ∥¯k(ℓ) i ∥ ≤β(ε(ℓ) + √α). Now, for each pair of i and j, we have: |q(ℓ) i · k(ℓ) j − ¯q(ℓ) i · ¯k(ℓ) j | = |q(ℓ) i · k(ℓ) j − ¯q(ℓ) i · k(ℓ) j + ¯q(ℓ) i · k(ℓ) j − ¯q(ℓ) i · ¯k(ℓ) j | ≤ |q(ℓ) i · k(ℓ) j − ¯q(ℓ) i · k(ℓ) j | + |¯q(ℓ) i · k(ℓ) j − ¯q(ℓ) i · ¯k(ℓ) j | = |(q(ℓ) i − ¯q(ℓ) i ) · k(ℓ) j | + |¯q(ℓ) i · (k(ℓ) j − ¯k(ℓ) j )| ≤ ∥q(ℓ) i − ¯q(ℓ) i ∥∥k(ℓ) j ∥ + ∥¯q(ℓ) i ∥∥k(ℓ) j − ¯k(ℓ) j ∥ ≤ √αβε(ℓ) + (√α + βε(ℓ))βε(ℓ) = 2√αβε(ℓ) + (βε(ℓ))2 On the other hand, according to the E.3, for a 0 < ε < 1/2 and d = O(log(n) ε2 ) there exists a matrix MQK ∈ Rd×D, such that if we define bQ(ℓ) = MQK ¯Q(ℓ) and bK(ℓ) = MQK ¯K(ℓ), |¯q(ℓ) i · ¯k(ℓ) j − ˆq(ℓ) i · ˆk(ℓ) j | < β2(α + (ε(ℓ))2 + 2√αε(ℓ))ε for all (i, j) pairs in the attention pattern. Note that we can define cW(ℓ) Q = M(ℓ) QKW(ℓ) Q , and cW(ℓ) K = M(ℓ) QKW(ℓ) K , both in Rd×D, as weights 23for the narrow attention score estimator network. With a triangle inequality we have |q(ℓ) i · k(ℓ) i − ˆq(ℓ) i · ˆk(ℓ) i | < β2(α + (ε(ℓ))2 + 2√αε(ℓ))ε + 2√αβε(ℓ) + (βε(ℓ))2. By setting ε(ℓ) ≤ 1, we have |q(ℓ) i · k(ℓ) i − ˆq(ℓ) i · ˆk(ℓ) i | < β2(α + 1 + 2√α)ε + β(2√α + β)ε(ℓ). Let us define εa = β2(α + 1 + 2√α)ε + β(2√α + β)ε(ℓ), we have: ba(ℓ) ij = exp(ˆq(ℓ) i · ˆk(ℓ) j ) P u∈NH(i) exp(ˆq(ℓ) i · ˆk(ℓ) u ) ≤ exp(q(ℓ) i · k(ℓ) j + εa) P u∈NH(i) exp(q(ℓ) i · k(ℓ) j − εa) ≤ a(ℓ) ij exp(2εa) ba(ℓ) ij = exp(ˆq(ℓ) i · ˆk(ℓ) j ) P u∈NH(i) exp(ˆq(ℓ) i · ˆk(ℓ) u ) ≥ exp(q(ℓ) i · k(ℓ) j − εa) P u∈NH(i) exp(q(ℓ) i · k(ℓ) u + εa) ≥ a(ℓ) ij exp(−2εa) Now we bound ∥h(ℓ+1/2) i − ˆh(ℓ+1/2) i ∥: ∥h(ℓ+1/2) i − ˆh(ℓ+1/2) i ∥ = ∥ X j∈Nei(i) a(ℓ) ij v(ℓ) j − baij ˆv(ℓ+1/2) j ∥ = ∥ X j∈Nei(i) a(ℓ) ij v(ℓ) j − ba(ℓ) ij v(ℓ) j + ba(ℓ) ij v(ℓ) j − baij ˆv(ℓ) j ∥ = ∥ X j∈Nei(i) (a(ℓ) ij − ba(ℓ) ij )v(ℓ) j + ba(ℓ) ij (v(ℓ) j − ˆv(ℓ) j )∥ = ∥(v(ℓ) j − ˆv(ℓ) j ) + v(ℓ) j X j∈Nei(i) (a(ℓ) ij − ba(ℓ) ij )∥ ≤ ∥v(ℓ) j − ˆv(ℓ) j ∥ + ∥v(ℓ) j ∥ X |a(ℓ) ij − ba(ℓ) ij | ≤ ε(ℓ)β + √α X max(1 − exp(−2εa), exp(2εa) − 1)a(ℓ) ij ≤ ε(ℓ)β + √α(exp(2εa) − 1), and since 1 + x <exp(x) < 1 + 2x for 0 < x <1, if we have εa < 1, we have ∥h(ℓ+1/2) i − ˆh(ℓ+1/2) i ∥ ≤βε(ℓ) + 4√αεa (1) For the feed-forward network part, we know that this network is β2-Lipschitz because W(ℓ) 1 and W(ℓ) 2 have maximum operator norm β and σ is a 1-Lipschitz activation function. Thus we have ∥h(ℓ+1) i − ˆh(ℓ+1) i ∥ ≤β2(βε(ℓ) + 4√αεa) = (β3 + 8βα + 4β2√α)ε(ℓ) + 4β2(α√α + 2α + √α)ε. Both β3 + 8βα + 4β2√α and 4β2(α√α + 2α + √α) are constants, and if we define them as c1 and c2, we have ε(ℓ+1) ≤ c1ε(ℓ) + c2ε Given ε(0) = 0, as both networks get the same input, we have ε(L) ≤ c1ε(L−1) + c2ε ≤ c1(c1ε(L−2) + c2ε) + c2ε ··· ≤ c2ε(cL−1 1 + ··· + c1) = c1(cL 2 − 1) c2 − 1 ε 24While the error increases exponentially with the number of layers, when we have L = O(1), then the error is bounded by a constant factor of chosen ε. Now, we know that ∥T (X)i − bT (X)i∥2 ≤ ε(L) = O(ε). While from the theorem it seems that the error is increasing exponentially by the layers, in practice the maximum number of layers used in this work is four with most large graph experiments using just two layers. Thus the constant factor will not be as large as it might look. Also, in real-world graphs usually, the columns of X are not quite n distinct vectors and many vectors would be equal or very similar to each other if we have κ unique vectors in the first layer the complexity for the d can be reduced to O(log κ ε2 ). In the homophily graphs the representations h(ℓ) tend to converge to each other and thus again the number of unique vectors will be reduced letting us have smaller d, but these assumptions are not considered in the proof as we keep it general. Although we have proved the existence of the bT , this does not mean that training with a gradient- based algorithm will necessarily lead to the introduced weights, but this gives at least the guarantee that such a network exists. However, on the other hand, it is also possible that the training process finds a set of weights that work better than the weights constructed in this proof. Theorem E.4, by narrowing the attention score calculation part, reduced the complexity fromO(mD+ nD2) to O(md + nD2), and for dense graphs or in scenarios we add denser expander graphs, where m ≫ n, already the introduced network has a much lower complexity. However, our narrow network uses narrow hidden dimensions in all steps and has complexity O(md + nd2). Proving the same guarantee along the whole network is not easy, if not impossible, without any further assumptions on X and the large network. Shirzad et al. (2024) explores these settings further, in the presence of various additional assumptions. E.2 Analysis of the Sampling Process After training a network with a smaller width d, we sample the edges from the original graph and use them in the second-phase training with a large hidden width D. In this section, we shall analyze our sampling process. Formally, we model our process as follows. Suppose that A is the attention score matrix with hidden width D, then we sample and rescale s entries of A to form a sparse matrix B where the goal is the matrix B can approximate A well, i.e., ∥A − B∥2 ≤ ε∥A∥2. However, recall that we can not access the entries of A precisely. Instead, we consider another attention score matrix A′, which corresponds to hidden width d. The first question is how many samples we indeed need to form the matrix B that approximates A well? To answer this, we have the following lemma for the attention score matrix A. Theorem E.5. Suppose that an n × n matrix A satisfies the following conditions: 1. For each i, we have ∥A(i)∥1 = 1. 2. maxj∥A(j)∥1 = K 3. Each column A(j) is ℓ-sparse. Then, consider the sampling procedure that samples s ≥ s0 = O(nK log n/(ε2∥A∥2 2)) = O(nℓ log n/(ε2K)) entries of A with replacement: 1. For each sampleBt, the probability thatBt samples entry Aij is pij = 1 n · |Aij| ∥A(i)∥1 = 1 n |Aij| (with a rescale factor 1/pij, i.e., Bt[i, j] = Aij/pij), and each Bt only samples one entry of A. 2. Form the matrix B = (B1 + B2 + ··· + Bs)/s. Then, we have that with probability at least 9/10, ∥A − B∥2 ≤ ε∥A∥2. To prove this lemma, we need the following matrix Bernstein inequality. 25Lemma E.6 (Matrix Bernstein inequality). Consider a finite sequence Xi of i.i.d. random m × n matrices, with E[Xi] = 0 and Pr(∥Xi∥2 ≤ R) = 1. Let σ2 = max{∥E[XiXT i ]∥2, ∥E[XT i Xi]∥2}. For some fixed s ≥ 1, let X = (X1 + X2 + ··· + Xs)/s, then we have that Pr[∥X∥2 ≥ ε] ≤ (m + n) · exp \u0012 sε2 −σ2 + Rε/3 \u0013 . Proof. We follow a similar proof strategy to that of Achlioptas et al. (2013). At a high level, the work of Achlioptas et al. (2013) considers the matrix Bernstein inequality, whose tail bound is dependent on the following two quantities: σ2 = max{∥E[(A − B1)(A − B1)T ]∥, ∥E[(A − B1)T (A − B1)]∥} and R = max∥A − B1∥ over all possible realizations of B1. Here B1 is the matrix that only samples one entry, and the final output isB = (B1 +B2 +··· +Bs)/s. Instead, we consider the following quantities, ˜σ2 = max   max i X j A2 ij/pij, max j X i A2 ij/pij    ˜R = max ij |Aij|/pij. It is shown in Lemma A.2 of Achlioptas et al. (2013) that |σ/˜σ − 1| ≤ ∥A∥2 2P i ∥A(i)∥2 1 and |R/ ˜R − 1| ≤ ∥A∥2 ∥A∥1 . From our condition on the matrix A, both of the upper bounds are at most 1. Hence, we only need to consider ˜σ and ˜R. Back to our case, we have that pij = 1 n · |Aij| ∥A(1)∥1 = 1 n · |Aij|, from this and the assumption of A we have ˜σ2 = n · max   max i X j |Aij|, max j X i |Aij|    ≤ n · K ˜R = max ij |Aij|/pij = n. Hence, to make δ ≤ 0.1, we only need to set ε′ = ε∥A∥2 in the Matrix Bernstein inequality and then we have s ≥ O(nK log n/(ε2∥A∥2 2)). Finally, note that if ∥A(j)∥1 = K, then we have ∥A∥2 ≥ ∥Aej∥2 = ∥A(j)∥2 ≥ K/ √ ℓ, which means that nK log n/(ε2∥A∥2 2) ≤ nℓ log n/(ε2K). However, as mentioned, we can not access the value of the entries ofA but the entries of A′ (which corresponds to the trained network with a small hidden width d). We next show that even in the case where we sample the entries of A from A′, we can still get the same order of the bound if the entries of A are not under-estimated seriously in A′. Proposition E.7. Suppose that the matrices A and A′ satisfy the condition in Theorem E.5 and for every i, jwe have |A′ ij| ≥1 α|Aij| for some sufficiently large constant α. Then consider the same sampling procedure in Theorem E.5 but sampling the entries of A from the value of A′. Then, the guarantee in Theorem E.5 still holds. Proof. We only need to note that from the assumption, the actual sampling probability p′ ij ≥ 1 α · pij in Theorem E.5, hence it will increase the ˜σ2 and ˜R by at most α times, which means that we can increase s by an α factor to make the error probability at most 0.1. 26F Attention Score Analysis In Figure 3, we observed that the attention scores are relatively close to the reference attention scores. In this section, we provide further details on these experiments and offer additional analysis of the attention scores. For our experiments, we used an implementation of the Exphormer model with normalization on V mappings and temperature adjustment for the attention scores. For each random seed, we selected the model with the best result on the validation set. We used an expander degree of 10 for the Actor dataset and 30 for Amazon-Photos. The difference in expander degrees is due to the significant variation in the average degree of nodes across the datasets. We aimed to balance the number of expander edges and graph edges since it has an impact on some of the experiments. In addition to the expander edges, we also included self-loops, which are necessary for the universal approximation theorem outlined by Shirzad et al. (2023). All networks in these experiments were trained with four layers. For each hidden dimension, we ran 100 experiments with different initializations. The learning rate was adjusted for each hidden dimension to ensure more stable convergence. However, for smaller hidden dimensions, some experiments led to drastically lower accuracy results, which we did not exclude from the analysis. All results, including those with lower accuracy, were considered in our analysis. F.1 Preliminaries Before presenting further experimental results, we provide a brief introduction to the metrics used. For two random variables X ∼ Pand Y ∼ Q, both defined in Rd (or equivalently, defined by their cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) F and G), we can define the following metrics: Energy Distance Energy distance is a metric used to measure the distance between two distributions (Székely and Rizzo, 2013; Sejdinovic et al., 2013; Rizzo and Székely, 2016), and is defined as: D2(F, G) = 2E[X − Y ] − E[X − X′] − E[Y − Y ′], where X, X′ ∼ Pand Y, Y′ ∼ Q, with all variables being independent of each other. This value is shown to be twice the Harald Cramer’s distance (Cramér, 1928), which is defined as: Z (F(x) − G(x))2 dx. This metric is non-negative; however, an unbiased estimator based on samples may yield negative results. Although the energy distance is a useful metric for identifying the distance between two probability distributions, it may not fully capture the variations between them. This issue becomes particularly relevant when measuring the performance of generative models, as it helps assess whether the generative model correctly approximates the real distribution. The following pairs of metrics provide finer-grained understanding of two different types of approximation. Precision & Recall (Sajjadi et al., 2018) These metrics assess generative models by constructing a manifold for both real and generated data. This is done by forming a hypersphere around each data point, extending its radius to the k-th nearest neighbor, and then aggregating these hyperspheres. Precision measures the proportion of generated samples that fall within the real data manifold, while recall quantifies the fraction of real samples covered by the generated data manifold. These metrics correlate well with human judgments in the visual domain and are effective in detecting issues like mode collapse and mode dropping. Density & Coverage (Naeem et al., 2020) These metrics, similar to Precision and Recall, evaluate generative models by considering individual hyperspheres rather than aggregating them into a manifold. Density measures the average number of real hyperspheres that each generated sample falls into, while Coverage quantifies the fraction of real samples that fall into at least one generated hypersphere. These metrics have been shown to be more robust than the Precision and Recall metrics in certain scenarios. 274 8 16 32 64 uniformrandom 4 8 16 32 64 uniform random 0.000 0.003 0.017 0.013 0.020 0.017 0.163 0.003 0.000 0.009 0.006 0.012 0.029 0.145 0.017 0.009 0.000 0.002 0.003 0.054 0.108 0.013 0.006 0.002 0.000 0.003 0.050 0.121 0.020 0.012 0.003 0.003 0.000 0.059 0.109 0.017 0.029 0.054 0.050 0.059 0.000 0.219 0.163 0.145 0.108 0.121 0.109 0.219 0.000 Actor Dataset without Expanders 0.000 0.025 0.050 0.075 0.100 0.125 0.150 0.175 0.200 (a) 4 8 16 32 64 uniformrandom 4 8 16 32 64 uniform random 0.000 0.000 0.004 0.008 0.018 0.187 0.115 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.007 0.018 0.200 0.102 0.004 0.000 0.000 0.001 0.009 0.214 0.120 0.008 0.007 0.001 0.000 0.017 0.208 0.125 0.018 0.018 0.009 0.017 0.000 0.228 0.154 0.187 0.200 0.214 0.208 0.228 0.000 0.360 0.115 0.102 0.120 0.125 0.154 0.360 0.000 Actor Dataset with Expanders 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35  (b) 4 8 16 32 64 uniformrandom 4 8 16 32 64 uniform random 0.000 0.028 0.004 0.067 0.037 0.027 0.197 0.028 0.000 0.029 0.035 0.043 0.095 0.108 0.004 0.029 0.000 0.057 0.025 0.039 0.203 0.067 0.035 0.057 0.000 0.024 0.144 0.137 0.037 0.043 0.025 0.024 0.000 0.091 0.198 0.027 0.095 0.039 0.144 0.091 0.000 0.306 0.197 0.108 0.203 0.137 0.198 0.306 0.000 Amazon-Photo Dataset without Expanders 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 (c) 4 8 16 32 64 uniformrandom 4 8 16 32 64 uniform random 0.000 0.009 0.008 0.040 0.068 0.225 0.095 0.009 0.000 0.022 0.080 0.116 0.217 0.065 0.008 0.022 0.000 0.024 0.053 0.276 0.124 0.040 0.080 0.024 0.000 0.011 0.340 0.225 0.068 0.116 0.053 0.011 0.000 0.362 0.271 0.225 0.217 0.276 0.340 0.362 0.000 0.208 0.095 0.065 0.124 0.225 0.271 0.208 0.000 Amazon-Photo Dataset with Expanders 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35  (d) Figure 9: Pairwise energy distance across networks with different hidden dimensions, uniform distribution, and randomly generated attention scores. For all these metrics, we first consider the distribution of attention scores for each individual node’s neighborhood in a single layer, trained with a specific hidden dimension, represented as a vector. We then compare these distributions across different hidden dimensions or among different layers. Finally, we average the results over all nodes. F.2 Pairwise Distances While we demonstrated the energy distances from the reference hidden dimension of 64 in Figure 3, it is also valuable to examine all pairwise distances. We present these pairwise distances in Figure 9. Additionally, these distances may vary layer by layer, so it is insightful to explore how these distances change across different layers of the network. To this end, we provide the results in Figures 10 to 13. These experiments consistently show that attention scores obtained from different hidden dimension sizes are close to each other. In contrast to uniform sampling, or randomly generated attention scores, this distribution provides a much better reference for drawing neighborhood samples when the goal is to select nodes based on their attention score importance. ♂lightbulbInsight 1 Attention scores from a network with a smaller hidden dimension serve as a good estimator for the attention scores in a network with a higher hidden dimension. 284 8 16 32 64 uniformrandom 4 8 16 32 64 uniform random 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.219 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.219 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.219 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.219 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.218 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.219 0.219 0.219 0.219 0.219 0.218 0.219 0.000 Actor Dataset without Expanders, Layer 0 0.000 0.025 0.050 0.075 0.100 0.125 0.150 0.175 0.200 (a) 4 8 16 32 64 uniformrandom 4 8 16 32 64 uniform random 0.000 0.004 0.020 0.020 0.029 0.022 0.148 0.004 0.000 0.009 0.009 0.016 0.039 0.121 0.020 0.009 0.000 0.002 0.004 0.064 0.078 0.020 0.009 0.002 0.000 0.003 0.069 0.086 0.029 0.016 0.004 0.003 0.000 0.078 0.069 0.022 0.039 0.064 0.069 0.078 0.000 0.219 0.148 0.121 0.078 0.086 0.069 0.219 0.000 Actor Dataset without Expanders, Layer 1 0.000 0.025 0.050 0.075 0.100 0.125 0.150 0.175 0.200  (b) 4 8 16 32 64 uniformrandom 4 8 16 32 64 uniform random 0.000 0.004 0.026 0.016 0.028 0.021 0.148 0.004 0.000 0.011 0.005 0.014 0.040 0.120 0.026 0.011 0.000 0.003 0.003 0.073 0.071 0.016 0.005 0.003 0.000 0.004 0.060 0.092 0.028 0.014 0.003 0.004 0.000 0.077 0.071 0.021 0.040 0.073 0.060 0.077 0.000 0.219 0.148 0.120 0.071 0.092 0.071 0.219 0.000 Actor Dataset without Expanders, Layer 2 0.000 0.025 0.050 0.075 0.100 0.125 0.150 0.175 0.200 (c) 4 8 16 32 64 uniformrandom 4 8 16 32 64 uniform random 0.000 0.002 0.023 0.015 0.024 0.026 0.136 0.002 0.000 0.014 0.008 0.017 0.039 0.121 0.023 0.014 0.000 0.003 0.006 0.080 0.066 0.015 0.008 0.003 0.000 0.005 0.070 0.086 0.024 0.017 0.006 0.005 0.000 0.080 0.075 0.026 0.039 0.080 0.070 0.080 0.000 0.219 0.136 0.121 0.066 0.086 0.075 0.219 0.000 Actor Dataset without Expanders, Layer 3 0.000 0.025 0.050 0.075 0.100 0.125 0.150 0.175 0.200  (d) Figure 10: Pairwise energy distance between networks with different hidden dimensions, uniform distribution, and random attention scores for the Actor dataset, without the expander graph, on individual layers. This dataset has a very low average degree and it appears that almost always the first layer’s attention scores are very similar to the uniform distribution. F.3 Entropy of Attention Scores In this experiment, we analyze the entropy of the attention scores to examine how they change across layers. When the scores approach a one-hot vector, we refer to them as sharp attentions, while more smooth scores resemble a uniform distribution over the neighbors. The goal is to assess how sharp or smooth the attention scores are, on average, across the nodes. To achieve this, we use the entropy metric. Higher entropy indicates more smooth attention scores, while entropy is zero for one-hot vectors. We calculate the entropy for each node’s neighborhood and then average the entropies across all nodes and all random seeds in the layer. The results are presented in Figure 14. An insightful observation from this experiment is that the first layer, across all four datasets, con- sistently exhibits smoother attention scores, while the scores become sharper in subsequent layers. Generally, however, the attention scores are not very sharp in experiments without expander graphs, suggesting that all neighbors are likely similarly informative. This does not necessarily imply that all these nodes are equally important. If identical nodes with the same neighborhoods surround a node, all of them will receive equal attention scores, which indicates no selection in this case. Thus, this does not contradict the idea that a sparse matrix can estimate the same results. Sharpness varies across different hidden dimensions, which may be due to factors such as training dy- namics, learning rate, and the varying temperature setup for different hidden dimensions. Regardless, in all datasets and across all hidden dimensions, the first layer consistently has higher entropy.

F.4 Inter-layer Attention Scores Similarity After observing that the entropy is higher in the first layer and similar across the subsequent layers, it is worth examining the distance between the attention scores of each pair of layers. The experimental results are presented in Figure 15. All values are relatively small compared to the previous ones, so they are multiplied by 100 for better presentation. The results show that, consistently, the first layer has some distance from all other layers, but the layers following it exhibit very similar attention scores. This suggests that the initial network may be trained using fewer layers, and further layer sampling could be achieved by repeating the attention scores from the final layer to train a deeper Spexphormer model. 304 8 16 32 64 uniformrandom 4 8 16 32 64 uniform random 0.000 0.004 0.002 0.038 0.016 0.012 0.239 0.004 0.000 0.012 0.022 0.013 0.029 0.207 0.002 0.012 0.000 0.049 0.021 0.006 0.270 0.038 0.022 0.049 0.000 0.010 0.079 0.197 0.016 0.013 0.021 0.010 0.000 0.040 0.213 0.012 0.029 0.006 0.079 0.040 0.000 0.306 0.239 0.207 0.270 0.197 0.213 0.306 0.000 Amazon-Photo Dataset without Expanders, Layer 0 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 (a) 4 8 16 32 64 uniformrandom 4 8 16 32 64 uniform random 0.000 0.031 0.004 0.075 0.041 0.034 0.176 0.031 0.000 0.030 0.033 0.047 0.114 0.074 0.004 0.030 0.000 0.061 0.026 0.050 0.175 0.075 0.033 0.061 0.000 0.031 0.170 0.094 0.041 0.047 0.026 0.031 0.000 0.108 0.181 0.034 0.114 0.050 0.170 0.108 0.000 0.306 0.176 0.074 0.175 0.094 0.181 0.306 0.000 Amazon-Photo Dataset without Expanders, Layer 1 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30  (b) 4 8 16 32 64 uniformrandom 4 8 16 32 64 uniform random 0.000 0.037 0.005 0.082 0.044 0.031 0.189 0.037 0.000 0.034 0.040 0.054 0.114 0.075 0.005 0.034 0.000 0.062 0.026 0.052 0.183 0.082 0.040 0.062 0.000 0.033 0.171 0.116 0.044 0.054 0.026 0.033 0.000 0.108 0.196 0.031 0.114 0.052 0.171 0.108 0.000 0.306 0.189 0.075 0.183 0.116 0.196 0.306 0.000 Amazon-Photo Dataset without Expanders, Layer 2 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 (c) 4 8 16 32 64 uniformrandom 4 8 16 32 64 uniform random 0.000 0.041 0.005 0.072 0.045 0.031 0.183 0.041 0.000 0.040 0.043 0.057 0.125 0.075 0.005 0.040 0.000 0.055 0.028 0.049 0.187 0.072 0.043 0.055 0.000 0.023 0.156 0.142 0.045 0.057 0.028 0.023 0.000 0.108 0.204 0.031 0.125 0.049 0.156 0.108 0.000 0.306 0.183 0.075 0.187 0.142 0.204 0.306 0.000 Amazon-Photo Dataset without Expanders, Layer 3 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30  (d) Figure 12: Pairwise energy distance between networks with different hidden dimensions, uniform distribution, and random attention scores for the Amazon-Photo dataset, without the expander graph, on individual layers. ♂lightbulbInsight 3 The attention scores in the layers after the first are consistently very similar to one another, but distinct from the attention scores in the first layer. F.5 Precision, Recall, Density, & Coverage (PRDC) Since the energy distance may not fully capture how distributions match in some cases, alternative metrics have been proposed, primarily for assessing the performance of generative models (Sajjadi et al., 2018; Naeem et al., 2020). In this work, we apply these metrics by considering the attention scores from the network with a hidden dimension of 64 as the reference distribution, assuming that all other dimensions aim to generate the same distribution. We use violin plots to illustrate the distribution of PRDC values across the nodes in each layer. The results are presented in Figures 16 to 19. The plots show the kernel density estimate of the corresponding metrics across all nodes, layers, and random initializations. Precision & Recall and Density & Coverage are pairs of metrics that together describe how well the distribution has been learned. Excelling in just one of these metrics does not necessarily imply that the samples are close to each other. As shown in the results, attention scores from other hidden dimensions consistently achieve high values across all metrics, while uniform distribution and random attention scores fall short in at least one of the metrics from each pair. 314 8 16 32 64 uniformrandom 4 8 16 32 64 uniform random 0.000 0.009 0.014 0.042 0.064 0.241 0.146 0.009 0.000 0.041 0.079 0.104 0.226 0.122 0.014 0.041 0.000 0.008 0.020 0.327 0.232 0.042 0.079 0.008 0.000 0.004 0.396 0.307 0.064 0.104 0.020 0.004 0.000 0.437 0.348 0.241 0.226 0.327 0.396 0.437 0.000 0.208 0.146 0.122 0.232 0.307 0.348 0.208 0.000 Amazon-Photo Dataset with Expanders, Layer 0 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 (a) 4 8 16 32 64 uniformrandom 4 8 16 32 64 uniform random 0.000 0.012 0.004 0.036 0.060 0.229 0.088 0.012 0.000 0.015 0.087 0.117 0.222 0.042 0.004 0.015 0.000 0.031 0.058 0.260 0.087 0.036 0.087 0.031 0.000 0.012 0.327 0.205 0.060 0.117 0.058 0.012 0.000 0.324 0.230 0.229 0.222 0.260 0.327 0.324 0.000 0.208 0.088 0.042 0.087 0.205 0.230 0.208 0.000 Amazon-Photo Dataset with Expanders, Layer 1 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30  (b) 4 8 16 32 64 uniformrandom 4 8 16 32 64 uniform random 0.000 0.003 0.006 0.037 0.071 0.212 0.074 0.003 0.000 0.007 0.054 0.098 0.220 0.058 0.006 0.007 0.000 0.024 0.063 0.258 0.087 0.037 0.054 0.024 0.000 0.015 0.314 0.187 0.071 0.098 0.063 0.015 0.000 0.338 0.246 0.212 0.220 0.258 0.314 0.338 0.000 0.208 0.074 0.058 0.087 0.187 0.246 0.208 0.000 Amazon-Photo Dataset with Expanders, Layer 2 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 (c) 4 8 16 32 64 uniformrandom 4 8 16 32 64 uniform random 0.000 0.012 0.008 0.045 0.078 0.216 0.072 0.012 0.000 0.026 0.100 0.145 0.200 0.037 0.008 0.026 0.000 0.031 0.070 0.261 0.090 0.045 0.100 0.031 0.000 0.012 0.323 0.202 0.078 0.145 0.070 0.012 0.000 0.348 0.258 0.216 0.200 0.261 0.323 0.348 0.000 0.208 0.072 0.037 0.090 0.202 0.258 0.208 0.000 Amazon-Photo Dataset with Expanders, Layer 3 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30  (d) Figure 13: Pairwise energy distance between networks with different hidden dimensions, uniform distribution, and random attention scores for the Amazon-Photo dataset, with the expander graph, on individual layers. F.6 Top-k Attention Sum Another way to assess the sharpness of the attention scores is by examining the sum of the top- k attention scores. If the top-k attention scores for a small k almost sum to one for all nodes, then using the top-k scores can closely approximate the representations of the larger network. However, this is not always the case. In this experiment, we analyze the sum of the top- k attention scores for k ranging from one to ten, across all nodes for hidden dimensions of 64 and 4. While the top-k attention score distributions are similar, the assumption that the sum will be close to one is unrealistic and does not occur frequently. The results, shown in Figure 20, include mean, median, and interquartile range, which indicate the spread of the middle 50% of the results. These results suggest that top-k attention selection may not be fully representative in transductive learning on graphs. This could be due to the presence of many similar nodes, causing the attention to be distributed across these nodes rather than being concentrated on a small subset, which affects the ability to approximate the larger network effectively using just the top-k scores. ♂lightbulbInsight 4 The attention scores in the layers after the first are consistently very similar to one another, but distinct from the attention scores in the first layer. 324 8 16 32 64 uniformrandom 0123 0.799 0.799 0.799 0.799 0.799 0.799 0.281 0.767 0.740 0.653 0.682 0.609 0.799 0.280 0.768 0.738 0.629 0.692 0.619 0.799 0.281 0.754 0.738 0.619 0.681 0.624 0.799 0.280 Actor Dataset without Expanders (a) 4 8 16 32 64 uniformrandom 0123 2.100 2.217 2.311 2.464 2.314 2.644 1.060 1.830 1.752 1.749 1.738 1.655 2.644 1.061 1.714 1.786 1.709 1.615 1.675 2.644 1.060 1.768 1.658 1.658 1.665 1.615 2.644 1.060 Actor Dataset with Expanders (b) 4 8 16 32 64 uniformrandom 0123 2.817 2.788 2.855 2.743 2.755 2.879 1.379 2.668 2.224 2.647 2.069 2.572 2.879 1.379 2.695 2.215 2.677 2.158 2.602 2.879 1.379 2.677 2.188 2.679 2.276 2.616 2.879 1.379 Amazon-Photo Dataset without Expanders (c) 4 8 16 32 64 uniformrandom 0123 2.896 2.767 2.882 2.908 2.902 4.015 2.263 2.566 2.263 2.303 2.668 2.856 4.015 2.264 2.596 2.387 2.316 2.635 2.879 4.015 2.263 2.549 2.361 2.323 2.680 2.885 4.015 2.264 Amazon-Photo Dataset with Expanders (d) Figure 14: Average entropy of attention scores for nodes across different layers. F.7 Attention Scores by Edge Type An interesting question is to examine the ratio of attention scores coming from graph edges versus expander edges and self-loops. Figure 21 illustrates how much of the attention score, on average, is attributed to each edge type across different hidden dimensions. We average the values over all nodes in all layers and random initializations. As expected, for a homophilic dataset like Amazon-Photo, the graph edges are more important. As the model’s hidden dimension increases, the model learns to place more attention on these edges. However, for a heterophilic dataset like Actor, the story is different, with graph edges playing a lower role. In Figure 22, we present a normalized version showing the average attention score by edge type. G Discussion Graph datasets arise from various domains, meaning that they might have differing inductive biases. More expressive methods may not necessarily yield better results on all datasets (Franks et al., 2024). Depending on the architecture and the task, more complex models can even lead to poorer results. Here, we discuss possible scenarios in which our model can be a good fit as well as the shortcomings of other classes of models that are overcome by our model. Graph Structure The relevance of the structure of the graph to the task can vary. For the simple synthetic task introduced in 1, the structure of the graph does not matter. So Transformers without inductive biases of the graphs are expressive enough to solve this problem; however message-passing networks will be restricted to the graph edges and rely on enough number of layers and may be challenged by oversquashing and oversmoothing problems. On the other hand, if the structure of the graph matters, such as counting the number of neighbor nodes with the same color for each node, the structure and the edges will be an important part. Transformers without expressive enough encodings to identify the graph edges will fail in this task. On the other hand, MPNNs even with one layer can easily solve this problem. Our approach enables solving problems in either case, by having both expander graphs for universal information propagation and the actual graph edges for inductive bias, 330 1 2 1 2 3 2.146 2.104 0.000 2.641 0.017 0.039 hidden dim = 4 0 1 2 1 2 3 3.910 3.960 0.010 3.865 -0.007 -0.022 hidden dim = 8 0 1 2 1 2 3 6.401 7.322 0.016 7.950 0.059 -0.002 hidden dim = 16 0 1 2 1 2 3 6.916 6.002 0.035 6.940 -0.027 0.025 hidden dim = 32 0 1 2 1 2 3 7.719 7.605 -0.060 7.931 0.067 0.077 hidden dim = 64 (a) Actor Dataset without Expander 0 1 2 1 2 3 1.003 0.497 0.387 0.498 0.085 -0.388 hidden dim = 4 0 1 2 1 2 3 1.760 1.609 -0.304 2.618 -0.048 0.210 hidden dim = 8 0 1 2 1 2 3 2.865 3.632 -0.002 3.758 -0.287 -0.231 hidden dim = 16 0 1 2 1 2 3 5.256 8.981 0.761 6.172 -0.379 0.273 hidden dim = 32 0 1 2 1 2 3 4.602 3.182 -0.058 3.917 -0.061 -0.250 hidden dim = 64 (b) Actor Dataset with Expander 0 1 2 1 2 3 0.679 0.515 0.011 0.554 -0.037 -0.032 hidden dim = 4 0 1 2 1 2 3 4.414 4.533 -0.077 5.172 0.043 -0.045 hidden dim = 8 0 1 2 1 2 3 2.562 2.683 -0.016 2.527 0.034 -0.035 hidden dim = 16 0 1 2 1 2 3 5.920 5.883 0.146 5.077 0.746 0.299 hidden dim = 32 0 1 2 1 2 3 2.933 3.048 0.025 3.112 0.257 0.024 hidden dim = 64 (c) Amazon-Photo Dataset without Expander 0 1 2 1 2 3 0.943 1.295 -0.069 1.563 0.005 -0.190 hidden dim = 4 0 1 2 1 2 3 2.930 1.836 0.047 2.976 -0.067 0.371 hidden dim = 8 0 1 2 1 2 3 5.029 5.319 -0.156 5.619 -0.051 -0.142 hidden dim = 16 0 1 2 1 2 3 3.754 4.692 0.024 4.066 -0.024 -0.004 hidden dim = 32 0 1 2 1 2 3 7.902 6.771 0.075 5.896 0.427 0.025 hidden dim = 64 (d) Amazon-Photo Dataset with Expander Figure 15: Inter-layer energy distances (×100) for different hidden dimensions. allowing the model to decide the subset of edges that suit the task better — only graph edges, only expander edges or a combination of both. Short-range Vs. Long-range Dependencies If the neighboring nodes tend to be from the same class, i.e., high homophily, MPNNs and methods such as NAGphormer (Chen et al., 2022a), which summarize the neighborhood have good inductive biases; whereas Transformers without proper identification for the neighborhoods may not be as fit for this task. Heterophily may not necessarily mean long-range dependencies, label of each node may just depend on the neighbor nodes, but still label of the neighbor nodes may be different most of the time. For example, for finding the grammatical function of the words in a sentence from a very long text, neighboring words are usually enough for this identification, and nearby words would be from different classes. On the other hand, some tasks may require long-range dependencies — identifying if there are other people in a social network with similar interests or the synthetic task introduced in 1 are some examples. Local models such as MPNNs would require deeper networks for modeling long-range dependencies that makes them prone to common problems such as oversquashing and oversmoothing (Topping et al., 2021; Di Giovanni et al., 2023b,a; Rusch et al., 2023). Our approach can be reduced to MPNN by giving lower attention scores to the expander edges, for learning on the tasks with short-range dependencies only. And also lets the long-range dependency modeling using expander edges.

But our approach lets learning without concern about the nature of the problem or having domain knowledge for the task or graph. Subsampling Graphs Many approaches break the graph into sections or subsample nodes or neighbors for training. This approach has shown promising results in many works such as (Zeng et al., 2020; Hamilton et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2021). However, there are many cases in which these approaches are not expressive enough. Clustering the nodes or batching and subsampling based on the neighborhood will not have the required inductive biases to solve the tasks with long-range dependencies. Approaches such as neighbor sampling or connected-subgraph sampling not only inherit the limits of the MPNN networks, but may even miss short-range dependencies. For example, Example (c) in 1 by merely random selection of the neighbors or subgraphs without considering the task. Random subset of node selection that has been used in several promising papers such as Wu et al. (2022, 2023, 2024) gives a chance for nodes from the same label to appear in the same batch, but the batch-size should increase with the graph size accordingly. Very small ratio of batch size to graph size would mean many edges or possible pair of nodes will never be appear in any batch and depending on the task this can limit the power of these models. Also, these models are usually not memory efficient, as graph size grows, they can not keep the batches small, and the required memory grows accordingly. On the other hand, our approach (1) makes smarter selection of neighbors based on the small network’s attention scores; (2) our sampling allows making k-hop neighborhood subgraphs from the extended graph connectivity, and (3) allows the training by trading off memory and time, without critical harm to the model’s expressive power. Unline the GraphSAGE and SGFormer, which use the full graph for the inference time our model uses the same sampling and batching techniques, letting efficient inference beside the efficient training. 38",

        "main_contributions": "The paper addresses the quadratic memory complexity of Graph Transformers for large graphs by proposing Spexphormer, a two-stage procedure. It empirically and theoretically demonstrates that attention scores are consistent across network widths. The key contributions include: 1) Analyzing the similarity of attention scores for networks of different widths and proposing two architectural changes (V normalization, variable temperature) to improve this similarity. 2) Introducing layer-wise sparsification by sampling according to learned attention scores, with theoretical analysis of sparsification guarantees. 3) Developing a two-phase training process that significantly reduces memory consumption while maintaining competitive accuracy, enabling scaling to larger datasets and facilitating novel batching techniques.",
        "methodology": "Spexphormer employs a two-phase training process. The first phase involves training an Attention Score Estimator Network, a narrow-width network (e.g., 4 or 8) with one attention head, on the full augmented graph (input graph edges, high-degree expander graph, self-loops). This network's goal is to estimate pairwise attention scores. Two architectural changes are introduced in this phase: normalizing V with a learnable global scale and gradually annealing the attention temperature (from 1.0 to 0.05) to sharpen attention scores. The second phase uses the estimated attention scores from the narrow network to construct sparse interaction graphs for each layer of a wider, final network. This sparsification is layer-wise, sampling a fixed degree of neighbors for each node based on their estimated attention scores, and allowing attention calculations via regular matrix multiplications. For efficient sampling, reservoir sampling is used. A neighborhood sampling batching technique is also implemented, tracing back necessary nodes through layers for computation. Theoretically, the paper provides conditions for a narrow network's attention scores to match a wide network's, and analyzes the sampling procedure's ability to approximate the attention matrix.",
        "experimental_setup": "Experiments were conducted on twelve medium-sized graphs (six homophilic: CS, Physics, Photo, Computer, WikiCS, ogbn-arxiv; six heterophilic: Minesweeper, Tolokers, Roman-empire, Amazon-ratings, Questions, Actor) and three large graphs (ogbn-proteins, Amazon2M, Pokec). Metrics included accuracy for most classification tasks and ROC-AUC for Minesweeper, Tolokers, Questions, and ogbn-proteins. Data splits followed standard practices or those from prior work (e.g., 60/20/20 random for some homophilic, 50/25/25 for Actor, specific splits for large graphs). Baselines included GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, GraphSAINT, Nodeformer, Difformer, SGFormer, GraphGPS, GOAT, GloGNN, SGC, NAGphormer, Exphormer, and SIGN. Attention score estimation studies used Actor and Photo datasets, varying hidden dimensions (4-64) over 100 runs, measuring energy distance, precision, recall, density, coverage, and top-k attention sum, compared against uniform and random baselines. Ablation studies on four datasets investigated uniform sampling, top-k selection, constant temperature, and absence of layer normalization. All trainings on medium-sized graphs and final large graph networks used A100 (40GB) or V100 (32GB/16GB) GPUs, while attention score estimation for large graphs utilized Intel Xeon E5-2680 v4 CPUs with up to 500GB RAM. Hyperparameters are detailed in tables for different datasets.",
        "limitations": "The attention score estimation phase, while crucial, can be memory-intensive, especially for very large datasets, requiring substantial CPU memory (e.g., >200GB for Amazon2M). For extremely large graphs, this still necessitates highly distributed computation. While theoretical analysis suggests exponential error increase with layers, practical applications typically use a limited number of layers (e.g., 2-4 in this work), mitigating this. The paper notes that top-k attention selection may not always be fully representative in transductive learning on graphs, possibly due to attention being distributed across many similar nodes rather than concentrated on a few, which could affect the approximation power of larger networks.",
        "future_research_directions": "Potential future research includes exploring dynamic methods to combine sampling with simultaneous attention score estimation, which could further scale this estimation process to even larger graphs. Additionally, further investigation into the theoretical conditions and empirical effectiveness of 'fully' narrow networks (as hinted in Shirzad et al., 2024) for achieving accurate attention scores in graph transformers could be a promising avenue. The observation that attention scores in layers after the first are very similar also suggests that the initial network might be trained with fewer layers, and deeper Spexphormer models could potentially reuse or repeat attention scores from the final layer of the estimator.",

Lane Department of Computer Science and Technology University of Cambridge & Samsung AI Center ABSTRACT Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance on a wide variety of tasks due to their ability to model non-uniform structured data. Despite their promise, there exists little research exploring methods to make them more efﬁ- cient at inference time. In this work, we explore the viability of training quantized GNNs, enabling the usage of low precision integer arithmetic during inference. For GNNs seemingly unimportant choices in quantization implementation cause dra- matic changes in performance. We identify the sources of error that uniquely arise when attempting to quantize GNNs, and propose an architecturally-agnostic and stable method, Degree-Quant, to improve performance over existing quantization- aware training baselines commonly used on other architectures, such as CNNs. We validate our method on six datasets and show, unlike previous attempts, that models generalize to unseen graphs. Models trained with Degree-Quant for INT8 quantization perform as well as FP32 models in most cases; for INT4 models, we obtain up to 26% gains over the baselines. Our work enables up to 4.7×speedups on CPU when using INT8 arithmetic. 1 I NTRODUCTION GNNs have received substantial attention in recent years due to their ability to model irregularly structured data. As a result, they are extensively used for applications as diverse as molecular interactions (Duvenaud et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2017), social networks (Hamilton et al., 2017), recommendation systems (van den Berg et al., 2017) or program understanding (Allamanis et al., 2018). Recent advancements have centered around building more sophisticated models including new types of layers (Kipf & Welling, 2017; Velickovic et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2019) and better aggregation functions (Corso et al., 2020). However, despite GNNs having few model parameters, the compute required for each application remains tightly coupled to the input graph size. A 2-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model with 32 hidden units would result in a model size of just 81KB but requires 19 GigaOPs to process the entire Reddit graph. We illustrate this growth in ﬁg. 1. One major challenge with graph architectures is therefore performing inference efﬁciently, which limits the applications they can be deployed for. For example, GNNs have been combined with CNNs for SLAM feature matching (Sarlin et al., 2019), however it is not trivial to deploy this technique on smartphones, or even smaller devices, whose neural network accelerators often do not implement ﬂoating point arithmetic, and instead favour more efﬁcient integer arithmetic. Integer quantization is one way to lower the compute, memory and energy budget required to perform inference, without requiring modiﬁcations to the model architecture; this is also useful for model serving in data centers. Although quantization has been well studied for CNNs and language models (Jacob et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018; Zafrir et al., 2019; Prato et al., 2019), there remains relatively little work addressing ∗Equal contribution.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no work explicitly characterising the issues that arise when quantizing GNNs or showing latency beneﬁts of using low-precision arithmetic. The recent work of Wang et al. (2020) explores only binarized embeddings of a single graph type (citation networks). In Feng et al. (2020) a heterogeneous quantization framework assigns different bits to embedding and attention coefﬁcients in each layer while maintaining the weights at full precision (FP32). Due to the mismatch in operands’ bit-width the majority of the operations are performed at FP32 after data casting, making it impractical to use in general purpose hardware such as CPUs or GPUs. In addition they do not demonstrate how to train networks which generalize to unseen input graphs. Our framework relies upon uniform quantization applied to all elements in the network and uses bit-widths (8-bit and 4-bit) that are supported by off-the-shelf hardware such as CPUs and GPU for which efﬁcient low-level operators for common operations found in GNNs exists. This work considers the motivations and problems associated with quantization of graph architectures, and provides the following contributions: • The explanation of the sources of degradation in GNNs when using lower precision arith- metic. We show how the choice of straight-through estimator (STE) implementation, node degree, and method for tracking quantization statistics signiﬁcantly impacts performance. • An architecture-agnostic method for quantization-aware training on graphs, Degree-Quant (DQ), which results in INT8 models often performing as well as their FP32 counterparts. At INT4, models trained with DQ typically outperform quantized baselines by over 20%. We show, unlike previous work, that models trained with DQ generalize tounseen graphs. We provide code at this URL: https://github.com/camlsys/degree-quant. • We show that quantized networks achieve up to 4.7×speedups on CPU with INT8 arithmetic, relative to full precision ﬂoating point, with 4-8×reductions in runtime memory usage. 2 B ACKGROUND 2.1 M ESSAGE PASSING NEURAL NETWORKS (MPNN S) Many popular GNN architectures may be viewed as generalizations of CNN architectures to an irregular domain: at a high level, graph architectures attempt to build representations based on a node’s neighborhood (see ﬁg. 2). Unlike CNNs, however, this neighborhood does not have a ﬁxed ordering or size. This work considers GNN architectures conforming to the MPNN paradigm (Gilmer et al., 2017). A graph G= (V,E) has node features X ∈RN×F , an incidence matrix I ∈N2×E, and optionally D- dimensional edge features E ∈RE×D. The forward pass through an MPNN layer consists of message passing, aggregation and update phases:h(i) l+1 = γ(h(i) l ,⋀ j∈N(i)[φ(h(j) l ,h(i) l ,eij)]). Messages from 2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 node uto node vare calculated using function φ, and are aggregated using a permutation-invariant function ⋀. The features at vare subsequently updated using γ. We focus on three architectures with corresponding update rules: 1. Graph Convolution Network (GCN):h(i) l+1 = ∑ j∈N(i)∪{i}( 1√ didj Wh(j) l ) (Kipf & Welling, 2017), where di refers to the degree of node i. 2. Graph Attention Network (GAT): h(i) l+1 = αi,iWh(i) l + ∑ j∈N(i)(αi,jWh(j) l ), where α represent attention coefﬁcients (Velickovic et al., 2018). 3. Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN): h(i) l+1 = fΘ[(1 +ϵ)h(i) l + ∑ j∈N(i) h(j) l ], where f is a learnable function (e.g. a MLP) and ϵis a learnable constant (Xu et al., 2019). 2.2 Q UANTIZATION FOR NON-GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS Quantization allows for model size reduction and inference speedup without changing the model architecture. While there exists extensive studies of the impact of quantization at different bit- widths (Courbariaux et al., 2015; Han et al., 2015; Louizos et al., 2017) and data formats (Micikevicius et al., 2017; Carmichael et al., 2018; Kalamkar et al., 2019), it is 8-bit integer (INT8) quantization that has attracted the most attention. This is due to INT8 models reaching comparable accuracy levels to FP32 models (Krishnamoorthi, 2018; Jacob et al., 2017), offer a 4×model compression, and result in inference speedups on off-the-shelf hardware as 8-bit arithmetic is widely supported. Quantization-aware training (QAT) has become the de facto approach towards designing robust quantized models with low error (Wang et al., 2018; Zafrir et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018). In their simplest forms, QAT schemes involve exposing the numerical errors introduced by quantization by simulating it on the forward pass Jacob et al. (2017) and make use of STE (Bengio et al., 2013) to compute the gradients—as if no quantization had been applied. For integer QAT, the quantization of a tensor xduring the forward pass is often implemented as: xq = min(qmax,max(qmin,⌊x/s+ z⌋)), where qmin and qmax are the minimum and maximum representable values at a given bit-width and signedness, sis the scaling factor makingxspan the [qmin,qmax] range and, zis the zero-point, which allows for the real value 0 to be representable in xq. Both sand zare scalars obtained at training time. hen, the tensor is dequantized as: ˆx= (xq −z)s, where the resulting tensor ˆx∼xfor a high enough bit-width. This similarity degrades at lower bit-widths. Other variants of integer QAT are presented in Jacob et al. (2017) and Krishnamoorthi (2018). To reach performance comparable to FP32 models, QAT schemes often rely on other techniques such as gradient clipping, to mask gradient updates based on the largest representable value at a given bit-width; stochastic, or noisy, QAT, which stochastically applies QAT to a portion of the weights at each training step (Fan et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2017); or the re-ordering of layers (Sheng et al., 2018; Alizadeh et al., 2019). 3 Q UANTIZATION FOR GNN S In this section, we build an intuition for why GNNs would fail with low precision arithmetic by identifying the sources of error that will disproportionately affect the accuracy of a low precision model. Using this insight, we propose our technique for QAT with GNNs, Degree-Quant. Our analysis focuses on three models: GCN, GAT and GIN. This choice was made as we believe that these are among the most popular graph architectures, with strong performance on a variety of tasks (Dwivedi et al., 2020), while also being representative of different trends in the literature. 3.1 S OURCES OF ERROR QAT relies upon the STE to make an estimate of the gradient despite the non-differentiable rounding operation in the forward pass. If this approximation is inaccurate, however, then poor performance will be obtained. In GNN layers, we identify the aggregation phase, where nodes combine messages from a varying number of neighbors in a permutation-invariant fashion, as a source of substantial numerical error, especially at nodes with high in-degree. Outputs from aggregation have magnitudes 3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 Figure 3: Analysis of values collected immediately after aggregation at the ﬁnal layer of FP32 GNNs trained on Cora. Generated using channel data collected from 100 runs for each architecture. As in-degree grows, so does the mean and variance of channel values after aggregation. that vary signiﬁcantly depending on a node’s in-degree: as it increases, the variance of aggregation values will increase.1 Over the course of training qmin and qmax, the quantization range statistics, become severely distorted by infrequent outliers, reducing the resolution for the vast majority of values observed. This reults in increased rounding error for nodes with smaller in-degrees. Controlling qmin and qmax hence becomes a trade-off balancing truncation error and rounding error. We can derive how the mean and variance of the aggregation output values vary as node in-degree,n, increases for each of the three GNN layers. Suppose we model incoming message values for a single output dimension with random variables Xi, without making assumptions on their exact distribution or independence. Further, we use Yn as the random variable representing the value of node output after the aggregation step. With GIN layers, we have Yn = (1 +ϵ)X0 + ∑n i=1 Xi. It is trivial to prove that E(Yn) = O(n). The variance of the aggregation output is also O(n) in the case that that ∑ i̸=j Cov(Xi,Xj) ≪∑ i Var(Xi). We note that if ∑ i̸=j Cov(Xi,Xj) is large then it implies that the network has learned highly redundant features, and may be a sign of over-ﬁtting. Similar arguments can be made for GCN and GAT layers; we would expect GCN aggregation values to grow like O(√n), and GAT aggregation values to remain constant (O(1)) due to the attention coefﬁcients. We empirically validate these predictions on GNNs trained on Cora; results are plotted in ﬁg. 3. We see that the aggregation values do follow the trends predicted, and that for the values of in-degree in the plot (up to 168) the covariance terms can be neglected. As expected, the variance and mean of the aggregated output grow fastest for GIN, and are roughly constant for GAT as in-degree increases. From this empirical evidence, it would be expected that GIN layers are most affected by quantization. By using GIN and GCN as examples, we can see how aggregation error causes error in weight updates. Suppose we consider a GIN layer incorporating one weight matrix in the update function i.e. h(i) l+1 = f(Wy(i) GIN), where f is an activation function, y(i) GIN = (1 +ϵ)h(i) l + ∑ j∈N(i) h(j) l , and N(i) denotes the in-neighbors of node i. Writing y(i) GCN = ∑ k∈N(i)( 1√didk Wh(j) l ), we see that the derivatives of the loss with respect to the weights for GCN and GIN are: GIN ∂L ∂W = |V |∑ i=1 ( ∂L ∂h(i) l+1 ◦f′(Wy(i) GIN) ) y(i)⊤ GIN GCN ∂L ∂W = |V |∑ i=1 ∑ j∈N(i) 1√ didj ( ∂L ∂h(i) l+1 ◦f′(y(i) GCN) ) h(j)⊤ l The larger the error in y(i) GIN—caused by aggregation error—the greater the error in the weight gradients for GIN, which results in poorly performing models being obtained. The same argument applies to GCN, with the h(j)⊤ l and y(i) GCN terms introducing aggregation error into the weight updates. 3.2 O UR METHOD : D EGREE -QUANT To address these sources of error we propose Degree-Quant (DQ), a method for QAT with GNNs. We consider both inaccurate weight updates and unrepresentative quantization ranges. 1The reader should note that we are not referring to the concept of estimator variance, which is the subject of sampling based approaches—we are exclusively discussing the variance of values immediately after aggregation. 4Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 Protect & Quantize . . .

Protected (high in-degree) nodes, in blue, operate at full precision, while unprotected nodes (red) operate at reduced precision. High in-degree nodes contribute most to poor gradient estimates, hence they are stochastically protected from quantization more often. Algorithm 1 Degree-Quant (DQ). Functions accepting a protective mask m perform only the masked computa- tions at full precision: intermediate tensors are not quantized. At test time protective masking is disabled. In ﬁg. 11 (in the Appendix) we show with a diagram how a GCN layers makes use of DQ. 1: procedure TRAIN FORWARD PASS (G,p) 2: ⊿Calculate mask and quantized weights, Θ′, which all operations share 3: m ←BERNOULLI (p) 4: Θ′←QUANTIZE (Θ) 5: ⊿Messages with masked sources are at full precision (excluding weights) 6: M←MESSAGE CALCULATE (G,Θ′,m) 7: X ←QUANTIZE (AGGREGATE (M,Θ′,m), m) ⊿No quantization for masked nodes 8: return UPDATE (X,Θ′,m) ⊿Quantized weights always used 9: end procedure Stochastic Protection from Quantization to Improve Weight Update Accuracy . DQ aims to encourage more accurate weight updates by stochastically protecting nodes in the network from quantization. At each layer a protective node mask is generated; all masked nodes have the phases of the message passing, aggregation and update performed at full precision. This includes messages sent by protected nodes to other nodes, as shown in ﬁg. 4 (a detailed diagram is shown in ﬁg. 11). It is also important to note that the weights used at all nodes are the same quantized weights; this is motivated by the fact that our method is used to encourage more accurate gradients to ﬂow back to the weights through high in-degree nodes. At test time protection is disabled: all nodes operate at low precision. To generate the mask, we pre-process each graph before training and create a vector of probabilities p with length equal to the number of nodes. At training time, mask m is generated by sampling using the Bernoulli distribution: m ∼Bernoulli(p). In our scheme pi is higher if the in-degree of node i is large, as we ﬁnd empirically that high in-degree nodes contribute most towards error in weight updates. We use a scheme with two hyperparameters, pmin and pmax; nodes with the maximum in-degree are assigned pmax as their masking probability, with all other nodes assigned a probability calculated by interpolating between pmin and pmax based on their in-degree ranking in the graph. Percentile Tracking of Quantization Ranges . Figure 3 demonstrates large ﬂuctuations in the variance of the aggregation output as in-degree increases. Since these can disproportionately affect the ranges found by using min-max or momentum-based quantization, we propose using percentiles. While percentiles have been used for post-training quantization (Wu et al., 2020), we are the ﬁrst (to the best of our knowledge) to propose making it a core part of QAT; we ﬁnd it to be a key contributor to achieving consistent results with graphs. Using percentiles involves ordering the values in the tensor and clipping a fraction of the values at both ends of the distribution. The fraction to clip is a hyperparameter. We are more aggressive than existing literature on the quantity we discard: we clip the top and bottom 0.1%, rather than 0.01%, as we observe the ﬂuctuations to be a larger issue with GNNs than with CNNs or DNNs. Quantization ranges are more representative of the vast majority of values in this scheme, resulting in less rounding error. We emphasize that a core contribution of DQ is that it is architecture-agnostic. Our method enables a wide variety of architectures to use low precision arithmetic at inference time. Our method is also or- thogonal—and complementary—to other techniques for decreasing GNN computation requirements, such as sampling based methods which are used to reduce memory consumption (Zeng et al., 2020), or weight pruning (Blalock et al., 2020) approaches to achieve further model compression. 5Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 vanillaSTE STE with Gradient ClippingDataset Model min/max momentum min/max momentumArch.

The conﬁguration that resulted in best performing models for each dataset-model pair is bolded. Hyperparameters for each experiment were ﬁne-tuned independently. As expected, adding clipping does not change performance with min/max but does with momentum. A major contribution of this work is identifying that seemingly unimportant choices in quantization implementation cause dramatic changes in performance. 4 E XPERIMENTS In this section we ﬁrst analyse how the choice of quantization implementation affects performance of GNNs. We subsequently evaluate Degree-Quant against the strong baselines of: FP32, INT8-QAT and, INT8-QAT with stochastic masking of weights (Fan et al., 2020). We refer to this last approach as noisy QAT or nQAT. To make explicit that we are quantizing both weights and activations, we use the notation W8A8. We repeat the experiments at INT4. Our study evaluates performance on six datasets and includes both node-level and graph-level tasks. The datasets used were Cora, CiteSeer, ZINC, MNIST and CIFAR10 superpixels, and REDDIT-BINARY . Across all datasets INT8 models trained with Degree-Quant manage to recover most of the accuracy lost as a result of quantization. In some instances, DQ-INT8 outperform the extensively tuned FP32 baselines. For INT4, DQ outperforms all QAT baselines and results in double digits improvements over QAT-INT4 in some settings. Details about each dataset and our experimental setup can be found in appendix A.1. 4.1 I MPACT OF QUANTIZATION GRADIENT ESTIMATOR ON CONVERGENCE The STE is a workaround for when the forward pass contains non-differentiable operations (e.g. round- ing in QAT) that has been widely adopted in practice. While the choice of STE implementation generally results in marginal differences for CNNs—even for binary networks (Alizadeh et al., 2019)—it is unclear whether only marginal differences will also be observed for GNNs. Motivated by this, we study the impact of four off-the-shelve quantization procedures on the three architectures evaluated for each type of dataset; the implementation details of each one is described in appendix A.3. We perform this experiment to ensure that we have the strongest possible QAT baselines. Results are shown in table 1. We found the choice quantization implementation to be highly dependent on the model architecture and type of problem to be solved: we see a much larger variance than is observed with CNNs; this is an important discovery for future work building on our study. We observe a general trend in all INT4 experiments beneﬁting from momentum as it helps smoothing out the quantization statistics for the inherently noisy training stage at low bitwidths. This trend applies as well for the majority of INT8 experiments, while exhibiting little impact on MNIST. For INT8 Cora-GCN, large gradient norm values in the early stages of training (see ﬁg. 5) mean that these models not beneﬁt from momentum as quantization ranges fail to keep up with the rate of changes in tensor values; higher momentum can help but also leads to instability. In contrast, GAT has stable initial training dynamics, and hence obtains better results with momentum. For the molecules dataset ZINC, we consistently obtained lower regression loss when using momentum. We note that GIN models often suffer from higher performance degradation (as was ﬁrst noted in ﬁg. 3), specially at W4A4. This is not the case however for image datasets using superpixels. We believe that datasets with Gaussian-like node degree distributions (see ﬁg. 9) are more tolerant of the imprecision introduced by quantization, compared to datasets with tailed distributions.

We provide two baselines for INT8 and INT4: standard QAT and stochastic QAT (nQAT). Both are informed by the analysis in 4.1, with nQAT achieving better performance in some cases. Models trained with Degree-Quant (DQ) are always comparable to baselines, and usually substantially better, especially for INT4. DQ is a stable method which requires little tuning to obtain excellent results across a variety of architectures and datasets. 4.2 O BTAINING QUANTIZATION BASELINES Our FP32 results, which we obtain after extensive hyperparameter tuning, and those from the baselines are shown at the top of table 2. We observed large gains on MNIST, CIFAR10 and, ZINC. For our QAT-INT8 and QAT-INT4 baselines, we use the quantization conﬁgurations informed by our analysis in section 4.1. For Citeseer we use the best resulting setup analysed for Cora, and for CIFAR- 10 that from MNIST. Then, the hyperparameters for each experiment were ﬁne tuned individually, including noise rate n ∈[0.5,0.95] for nQAT experiments. QAT-INT8 and QAT-INT4 results in table 2 and QAT-INT4, with the exception of MNIST (an easy to classify dataset), corroborate our hypothesis that GIN layers are less resilient to quantization. This was ﬁrst observed in ﬁg. 3. In the case of ZINC, while all models results in noticeable degradation, GIN sees a more severe 16% increase of regression loss compared to our FP32 baseline. For QAT W4A4 an accuracy drop of over 35% and 47% is observed for Cora and Citeseer respectively. The stochasticity induced by nQAT helped in recovering some of the accuracy lost as a result of quantization for citation networks (both INT8 and INT4) but had little impact on other datasets and harmed performance in some cases. 4.3 C OMPARISONS OF DEGREE -QUANT WITH EXISTING QUANTIZATION APPROACHES Degree-Quant provides superior quantization for all GNN datasets and architectures. Our results with DQ are highlighted in gray in table 2 and table 3. Citation networks trained with DQ for W8A8 manage to recover most of the accuracy lost as a result of QAT and outperform most of nQAT baselines. In some instances DQ-W8A8 models outperform the reference FP32 baselines. At 4-bits, DQ results in even larger gains compared to W4A4 baselines. We see DQ being more effective for GIN layers, outperforming INT4 baselines for Cora (+24.9%), Citeseer (+26.2%) and REDDIT- BINARY (+23.0%) by large margins. Models trained with DQ at W4A4 for graph classiﬁcation and graph regression also exhibit large performance gains (of over 10%) in most cases.

Quantization provides large speedups on a variety of graphs for CPU and non-negligible speedups with unoptimized INT8 GPU kernels. models achieve over 20% lower regression loss. Among the top performing models using DQ, ratios of pmin and pmax in [0.0,0.2] were the most common. Figure 10 in the appendix shows validation loss curves for GIN models trained using different DQ probabilities on the REDDIT-BINARY dataset. 5 D ISCUSSION Latency and Memory Implications . In addition to offering signiﬁcantly lower memory usage (4×with INT8), quantization can reduce latency—especially on CPUs. We found that with INT8 arithmetic we could accelerate inference by up to 4.7×. We note that the latency beneﬁt depends on the graph topology and feature dimension, therefore we ran benchmarks on a variety of graph datasets, including Reddit2, Zinc, Cora, Citeseer, and CIFAR-10; Zinc and Reddit results are shown in table 4, with further results given in the appendix. For a GCN layer with in- and out-dimension of 128, we get speed-ups of: 4.3×on Reddit, 2.5×on Zinc, 1.3×on Cora, 1.3×on Citeseer and, 2.1×on CIFAR-10. It is also worth emphasizing that quantized networks are necessary to efﬁciently use accelerators deployed in smartphones and smaller devices as they primarily accelerate integer arithmetic, and that CPUs remain a common choice for model serving on servers. The decrease in latency on CPUs is due to improved cache performance for the sparse operations; GPUs, however, see less beneﬁt due to their massively-parallel nature which relies on mechanisms other than caching to hide slow random memory accesses, which are unavoidable in this application. Figure 5: qmax with absolute min/max and percentile ranges, applied to INT8 GCN training on Cora. We ob- serve that the percentile max is half that of the absolute, doubling resolution for the majority of values. Figure 6: Analysis of how INT8 GAT performance degrades on Cora as individual elements are reduced to 4-bit precision without DQ. For GAT the message elements are crucial to classiﬁcation performance. Ablation Study: Beneﬁts of Percentile Ranges . Figure 5 shows the value of percentiles during training. We see that when using absolute min/max the upper range grows to over double the range required for 99.9% of values, effectively halving the resolution of the quantized values. DQ is more stable, and we obtained strong results with an order of magnitude less tuning relative to the baselines. Ablation Study: Source of Degradation at INT4. Figure 6 assesses how INT8 GAT (without DQ) degrades as single elements are converted to INT4, in order to understand the precipitous drop in 2The largest graph commonly benchmarked on in the GNN literature 8Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 accuracy in the INT4 baselines; further plots for GCN and GIN are included in the appendix. We observe that most elements cause only modest performance losses relative to a full INT8 model. DQ is most important to apply to elements which are constrained by numerical precision, such as the aggregation and message elements in GAT. Weight elements, however, are consistently unaffected. Ablation Study: Effect of Stochastic Element in Degree-Quant . We observe that the stochastic protective masking in DQ alone often achieves most of the performance gain over the QAT baseline; results are given in table 9 in the appendix. The beneﬁt of the percentile-based quantization ranges is stability, although it can yield some performance gains. The full DQ method provides consistently good results on all architectures and datasets, without requiring an extensive analysis as in 4.1. 6 C ONCLUSION This work has presented Degree-Quant, an architecture-agnostic and stable method for training quantized GNN models that can be accelerated using off-the-shelf hardware. With 4-bit weights and activations we achieve 8×compression while surpassing strong baselines by margins regularly exceeding 20%. At 8-bits, models trained with DQ perform on par or better than the baselines while achieving up to 4.7×lower latency than FP32 models. Our work offers a comprehensive foundation for future work in this area and is a ﬁrst step towards enabling GNNs to be deployed more widely, including to resource constrained devices such as smartphones.

Graphsaint: Graph sampling based inductive learning method, 2020. 11Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 A A PPENDIX Readers seeking advice on implementation will ﬁnd appendix A.5 especially useful. We provide signiﬁcant advice surrounding best practices on quantization for GNNs, along with techniques which we believe can boost our methods beyond the performance described in this paper, but for which we did not have time to fully evaluate. A.1 E XPERIMENTAL SETUP As baselines we use the architectures and results reported by Fey & Lenssen (2019) for citation networks, Dwivedi et al. (2020) for MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ZINC and, Xu et al. (2019) for REDDIT- BINARY . We re-implemented the architectures and datasets used in these publications and replicated the results reported at FP32. Models using GIN layers learn parameter ϵ. These models are often referred to as GIN- ϵ. The high-level description of these architectures is shown in table 5. The number of parameters for each architecture-dataset in this work are shown in table 6. Our infrastructure was implemented using PyTorch Geometric (PyG) (Fey & Lenssen, 2019). We generate candidate hyperparameters using random search, and prune trials using the asynchronous hyperband algorithm (Li et al., 2020). Hyperparameters searched over were learning rate, weight decay, and dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) and drop-edge (Rong et al., 2020) probabilities. The search ranges were initialized centered at the values used in the reference implementations of the baselines. Degree-Quant requires searching for two additional hyperparameters, pmin and pmax, these were tuned in a grid-search fashion. We report our results using the hyperparameters which achieved the best validation loss over 100 runs on the Cora and Citeseer datasets, 10 runs for MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ZINC, and 10-fold cross-validation for REDDIT-BINARY . We generally used fewer hyperparameter runs for our DQ runs than we did for baselines—even ignoring the searches over the various STE conﬁgs. As our method is more stable, ﬁnding a reasonable set of parameters was easier than before. As is usual with quantization experiments, we found it useful to decrease the learning rate relative to the FP32 baseline. Our experiments ran on several machines in our SLURM cluster using Intel CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs. Each machine was running Ubuntu 18.04. The GPU models in our cluster were: V100, RTX 2080Ti and GTX 1080Ti. Model # Layers # Hidden Units Residual Output MLP Arch.

In this way, all intermediate tensors in GNNs are quantized with the exception of the attention mechanism in GAT; we do not quantize after the softmax calculation, due to the numerical precision required at this 12Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 stage. With the exception of Cora and Citeseer, the models evaluated in this work make use of Batch Normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015). For deployments of quantized models, Batch Normalization layers are often folded with the weights (Krishnamoorthi, 2018). This is to ensure the input to the next layer is within the expected [qmin,qmax] ranges. In this work, for both QAT baselines and QAT+DQ, we left BN layers unfolded but ensure the inputs and outputs were quantized to the appropriate number of bits (i.e. INT8 or INT4) before getting multiplied with the layer weights. We leave as future work proposing a BN folding mechanism applicable for GNNs and studying its impact for deployments of quantized GNNs. The GIN models evaluated on REDDIT-BINARY used QAT for all layers with the exception of the input layer of the MLP in the ﬁrst GIN layer. This compromise was needed to overcome the severe degradation introduced by quantization when operating on nodes with a single scalar as feature.

For Cora and Citeseer datasets, nodes correspond to documents and edges to citations between these. Node features are a bag-of-words representation of the document. The task is to classify each node in the graph (i.e. each document) correctly. The MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets (commonly used for image classiﬁcation) are transformed using SLIC (Achanta et al., 2012) into graphs where each node represents a cluster of perceptually similar pixels or superpixels. The task is to classify each image using their superpixels graph representation. The ZINC dataset contains graphs representing molecules, were each node is an atom. The task is to regress a molecular property (constrained solubility (Jin et al., 2018)) given the graph representation of the molecule. Nodes in graphs of the REDDIT-BINARY dataset represent users of a Reddit thread with edges drawn between a pair of nodes if these interacted. This dataset contains graphs of two types of communities: question-answer threads and discussion threads. The task is to determine if a given graph is from a question-answer thread or a discussion thread. We use standard splits for MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ZINC. For citation datasets (Cora and Citeseer), we use the splits used by Kipf & Welling (2017). For REDDIT-BINARY we use 10-fold cross validation.

Some datasets are only referred to in ﬁg. 1 A.3 Q UANTIZATION IMPLEMENTATIONS In section 4.1 we analyse different readily available quantization implementations and how they impact in QAT results. First, vanilla STE, which is the reference STE (Bengio et al., 2013) that lets the gradients pass unchanged; and gradient clipping (GC), which clips the gradients based on the maximum representable value for a given quantization level. Or in other words, GC limits gradients if the tensor’s magnitudes are outside the [qmin, qmax] range. xmin = {min(X) if step = 0 min(xmin,X) otherwise (1) xmin = {min(X) if step = 0 (1 −c)xmin + cmin(X) otherwise (2) 13Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 The quantization modules keep track of the input tensor’s min and max values,xmin and xmax, which are then used to compute qmin, qmax, zero-point and scale parameters. For both vanilla STE and GC, we study two popular ways of keeping track of these statistics: min/max, which tracks the min/max tensor values observed over the course of training; and momentum, which computes the moving averages of those statistic during training. The update rules for xmin for STE min/max and STE momentum are presented in eq. (1) and eq. (2) respectively, whereXis the tensor to be quantized and cis the momentum hyperparameter, which in all our experiments is set to its default 0.01. Equivalent rules apply when updating xmax (omitted). For stochastic QAT we followed the implementation described in Fan et al. (2020), where at each training step a binary mask sampled from a Bernoulli distribution is used to specify which elements of the weight tensor will be quantized and which will be left at full precision. We experimented with block sizes larger than one (i.e. a single scalar) but often resulted in a sever drop in performance. All the reported results use block size of one. A.4 D EGREE -QUANT AND GRAPH LEVEL SUMMARIZATION The percentile operation in our quantization scheme remains important for summarizing the graph when doing graph-level tasks, such as graph regression (Zinc) or graph classiﬁcation (MNIST, CIFAR- 10 and REDDIT-BINARY). Since the number of nodes in each input graph is not constant, this can cause the summarized representation produced from the ﬁnal graph layer to have a more tailed distribution than would be seen with other types of architectures (e.g. CNN). Adding the percentile operation reduces the impact of these extreme tails in the fully connected graph-summarization layers, thereby increasing overall performance. The arguments regarding weight update accuracy also still apply, as the ∂L ∂h(i) l+1 term in the equations for the GCN and GIN should be more accurate compared to when the activations are always quantized before the summarization. This phenomenon is also noted by Fan et al. (2020). A.5 I MPLEMENTATION ADVICE We provide details that will be useful for others working in the area, including suggestions that should boost the performance of our results and accelerate training. We release code on GitHub; this code is a clean implementation of the paper, suitable for users in downstream works. A.5.1 Q UANTIZATION SETUP As our work studies the pitfalls of quantization for GNNs, we were more aggressive in our imple- mentation than is absolutely necessary: everything (where reasonably possible) in our networks is quantized. In practice, this leaves low-hanging fruit for improvements in accuracy: • Not quantizing the ﬁnal layer (as is common practice for CNNs and Transformers) helps with accuracy, especially at INT4. A similar practice at the ﬁrst layer will also be useful. • Using higher precision for the “summarization” stages of the model, which contributes little towards the runtime in most cases. • Taking advantage of mixed precision: since the beneﬁts of quantization are primarily in the message passing phase (discussed below), one technique to boost accuracy is to only make the messages low precision. We advise choosing a more realistic (less aggressive) convention than used in this work. The ﬁrst two items would be appropriate. A.5.2 R ELATIVE VALUE OF PERCENTILES COMPARED TO PROTECTIVE MASKING There are two components to our proposed technique: stochastic, topology-aware, masking and percentile-based range observers for quantizers. We believe that percentiles provide more immediate value, especially at INT4. We ﬁnd that they are useful purely from the perspective of stabilizing the optimization and reducing the sensitivity to hyperparameters. 14Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 However, adding the masking does improve performance further. This is evident from table 9. In fact, performance may be degraded slightly when percentiles are also applied: this can be observed by comparing table 9 to the main results in the paper, table 2. A.5.3 P ERCENTILES The key downside with applying percentiles for range observers is that the operation can take signiﬁcant time. Training with DQ is slower than before—however, since there is less sensitivity to hyperparameters, fewer runs end up being needed. We are conﬁdent that an effective way to speed up this operation is to use sampling. We expect 10% of the data should be adequate, however we believe that even 1% of the data may be sufﬁcient (dataset and model dependent). However, we have not evaluated this setup in the paper; it is provided in the code release for experimentation. A.5.4 I MPROVING ON PERCENTILES We believe that it is possible to signiﬁcantly boost the performance of GNN quantization by employing a learned step size approach. Although we used percentiles in this paper to illustrate the range- precision trade-off for GNNs, we expect that learning the ranges will lead to better results. This approach, pioneered by works such as Esser et al. (2020), has been highly effective on CNNs even down to 2 bit quantization. Another approach would be to use robust quantization: the ideas in these works are to reduce the impact of changing quantization ranges i.e. making the architecture more robust to quantization. Works in this area include Alizadeh et al. (2020) and Shkolnik et al. (2020). A.5.5 I MPROVING LATENCY The slowest step of GNN inference is typically the sparse operations. It is therefore best to minimize the sizes of the messages between nodes i.e. quantize the message phase most aggressively. This makes the biggest impact on CPUs which are dependent on caches to obtain good performance. We evaluated our code on CPU using Numpy and Scipy routines. For the GPU, we used implemen- tations from PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric and lightly modiﬁed them to support INT8 where necessary. These results, while useful for illustrating the beneﬁts of quantization, are by no means optimal: we did not devote signiﬁcant time to improving latency. We believe better results can be obtained by taking advantage of techniques such as cache blocking or kernel fusion. A.5.6 P ITFALLS Training these models can be highly unstable: some experiments in the paper had standard deviations as large as 18%. We observed this to affect citation network experiments to the extent that they would not converge on GPUs: all these experiments had to be run on CPUs. A.6 D EGRADATION STUDIES Figures 7 and 8 show the results of the ablation study conducted in section 5 for GCN and GIN. We observe that GCN is more tolerant to INT4 quantization than other architectures. GIN, however, requires accurate representations after the update stage, and heavily suffers from further quantization like GAT. The idea of performing different stages of inference at different precisions has been proposed, although it is uncommon (Wang et al., 2018). 15Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 Figure 7: Degradation of INT8 GCN on Cora as indi- vidual elements are converted to INT4without Degree- Quant.

The bottom row of results were obtained with noisy quantization (nQAT) at INT4 with the use of percentiles. DQ masking alone is often sufﬁcient to achieve excellent results, but the addition of percentile-based range tracking can be beneﬁcial to increase stability. We can see that using nQAT with percentiles is not sufﬁcient to achieve results of the quality DQ provides. Device Arch.

        "main_contributions": "This research addresses the lack of efficient inference methods for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by exploring quantization-aware training. It identifies unique sources of error that arise when quantizing GNNs, particularly the impact of straight-through estimator implementation, node degree, and quantization statistics tracking. The main contribution is Degree-Quant (DQ), an architecture-agnostic and stable method for quantization-aware training. DQ enables INT8 quantized GNN models to perform on par with FP32 models in most cases and achieves up to 26% accuracy gains over baselines for INT4 models. Unlike previous attempts, models trained with DQ generalize to unseen graphs. Furthermore, the work demonstrates up to 4.7x speedups on CPU with INT8 arithmetic and 4-8x reductions in runtime memory usage, facilitating broader deployment of GNNs on resource-constrained devices.",
        "methodology": "The methodology focuses on uniform quantization of all network elements (weights and activations) to 8-bit (INT8) and 4-bit (INT4) precision, supported by off-the-shelf hardware. The core technique is Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), using a Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to simulate quantization in the forward pass while allowing gradient computation. The proposed method, Degree-Quant (DQ), incorporates two key innovations: 1) Stochastic Protection from Quantization, which stochastically protects high in-degree nodes from quantization during training, performing their message passing, aggregation, and update phases at full precision (while weights remain quantized for all nodes). This protective mask is generated based on node in-degree, with higher probabilities for higher-degree nodes, and is disabled during inference. 2) Percentile Tracking of Quantization Ranges, which uses percentiles (clipping the top and bottom 0.1% of values) to calculate quantization ranges. This approach ensures quantization ranges are more representative by mitigating distortions caused by outliers, thereby reducing rounding error. The method is architecture-agnostic, validated on GCN, GAT, and GIN.",
        "experimental_setup": "The study evaluates GCN, GAT, and GIN architectures across six datasets covering node-level classification (Cora, Citeseer), graph-level classification (MNIST and CIFAR10 superpixels, REDDIT-BINARY), and graph-level regression (ZINC). Benchmarks include FP32 models and various QAT baselines (INT8-QAT and INT4-QAT) using four common STE implementations (vanilla STE with min/max or momentum tracking, and STE with gradient clipping and min/max or momentum tracking), as well as noisy QAT (nQAT) with stochastic masking of weights. Performance is measured by accuracy for classification and loss for regression. Experiments involved 100 runs for Cora/Citeseer, 10 runs for MNIST/CIFAR10/ZINC, and 10-fold cross-validation for REDDIT-BINARY. Hyperparameters were tuned using random search with asynchronous hyperband, while DQ-specific pmin and pmax were grid-searched. Quantization was applied to all elements of each network (inputs, weights, messages, aggregation inputs/outputs, update outputs), with exceptions for GAT's softmax output and the input layer of GIN's MLP for REDDIT-BINARY. Latency benchmarks were performed on a 22-core 2.1GHz Intel Xeon Gold 6152 CPU and a GTX 1080Ti GPU.",
        "limitations": "The paper acknowledges that its aggressive quantization strategy (quantizing nearly everything) leaves room for accuracy improvements by employing less aggressive approaches, such as not quantizing the final/first layers, using higher precision for summarization stages, or mixed precision. A Batch Normalization (BN) folding mechanism, common in quantized CNNs, is not proposed or studied for GNNs. The current percentile tracking, while effective, can be time-consuming during training, and the proposed sampling-based acceleration was not evaluated. The study notes that GPUs see fewer latency benefits from quantization compared to CPUs due to their parallel architecture, and unoptimized INT8 GPU kernels were used. Training GNN models with quantization can be highly unstable, leading to large standard deviations and, in some cases, convergence issues on GPUs that necessitated CPU execution. GIN models operating on single scalar features required a compromise (unquantized input layer) to mitigate severe degradation.",
        "future_research_directions": "Future research could explore developing and evaluating a Batch Normalization folding mechanism specifically tailored for GNNs. A more in-depth analysis of how graph topology influences quantization effectiveness is suggested. Incorporating learned step size approaches (e.g., from Esser et al., 2020) or robust quantization techniques (e.g., Alizadeh et al., 2020; Shkolnik et al., 2020) could further improve performance. Optimizing INT8 GPU kernels using techniques like cache blocking or kernel fusion is proposed to achieve better latency benefits on GPUs. Investigating the efficacy of sampling (e.g., using 1-10% of data) to speed up the percentile-based range tracking operation during training is also a promising direction. Finally, exploring less aggressive and mixed-precision quantization strategies, such as not quantizing the first or final layers, or using higher precision for graph summarization stages, could yield further accuracy gains.",

        "experimental_info": "The methodology focuses on uniform quantization of all network elements (weights and activations) to either 8-bit (INT8) or 4-bit (INT4) precision. This is achieved through Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) using a Straight-Through Estimator (STE) for gradient computation.\n\nKey innovations of the proposed method, Degree-Quant (DQ), include:\n1.  **Stochastic Protection from Quantization:**\n    *   During the training phase, nodes identified as having a high in-degree are stochastically protected from quantization. For these protected nodes, their message passing, aggregation, and update phases are executed at full precision (FP32).\n    *   Node weights, however, remain quantized (INT8/INT4) for all nodes, irrespective of their protection status.\n    *   A protective mask is dynamically generated based on the node's in-degree, assigning higher probabilities of protection to nodes with higher degrees. This probabilistic mask is controlled by `low_quantise_prob` and `high_quantise_prob` parameters (e.g., set via `--low` and `--change` command-line arguments).\n    *   This stochastic protection mechanism is active only during training and is entirely disabled during inference, where all nodes operate at the specified lower precision (INT8/INT4).\n2.  **Percentile Tracking of Quantization Ranges:**\n    *   To compute quantization ranges, the method employs percentile clipping. Specifically, the top and bottom 0.1% of values are clipped (e.g., `percentile=0.001` for INT8, or `percentile=0.01` for INT4 when using `--ste_per` or `--gc_per` flags).\n    *   This approach ensures that quantization ranges are more robust and representative by mitigating distortions caused by outliers, thereby reducing rounding error during quantization.\n\nThe method is designed to be architecture-agnostic and has been validated on various Graph Neural Network architectures, including GCN, GAT, and GIN. The provided code specifically demonstrates the implementation for GIN (`GINConvMultiQuant`).\n\n**Experimental Settings:**\n*   **Bit-width:** Configurable to INT8 or INT4 using `--int8` or `--int4` flags.\n*   **Quantization-Aware Training:** Enabled by default with STE. Gradient clipping (`GC`) or STE (`STE`) can be selected with options like `--ste_per` or `--gc_per`.\n*   **Degree-Quant Activation:** Enabled by the `--DQ` flag.\n*   **Mask Probability Range:** Configured using `--low` (base probability for protection) and `--change` (increment to `low` to determine `high_quantise_prob`) arguments, which influence the `ProbabilisticHighDegreeMask`.\n*   **Percentile Clipping:** Activated by `--ste_per` or `--gc_per`, setting `percentile` to `0.001` (0.1%) for INT8 and `0.01` (1%) for INT4, aligning with the method's description of clipping the top and bottom 0.1% for INT8. Other `ste_mode` options (`ste_abs`, `ste_mom`, `gc_abs`, `gc_mom`) apply different range tracking strategies."

T o mitigate the vanishing gradient problem caused by sparse connections between nodes, we propose a Local Gradie nt method to serve the quantization error of the node features as the supervisi on during training. W e also develop a Nearest Neighbor Strategy to deal with the gen eralization on unseen graphs. Extensive experiments on eight public node-level a nd graph-level datasets demonstrate the generality and robustness of our proposed m ethod. Compared to the FP32 models, our method can achieve up to a 18.6x (i.e., 1. 70bit) compression ratio with negligible accuracy degradation. Morever, comp ared to the state-of-the- art quantization method, our method can achieve up to 11.4% a nd 9.5% accuracy improvements on the node-level and graph-level tasks, resp ectively, and up to 2x speedup on a dedicated hardware accelerator. 1 I NTRODUC TI ON Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have attracted much attention due to their superior learn- ing and representing ability for non-Euclidean geometric d ata. A number of GNNs have been widely used in real-world applications, such as recommendation sy stem (Jin et al., 2020), and social net- work analysis (Lerer et al., 2019), etc. Many of these tasks p ut forward high requirements for low- latency inference. However, the real-world graphs are ofte n extremely large and irregular, such as Reddit with 232,965 nodes, which needs 19G ﬂoating-point op erations (FLOPs) to be processed by a 2-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with only 81KB pa rameters (T ailor et al., 2020), while ResNet-50, a 50-layer DNN, only takes 8G FLOPs to process an i mage (Canziani et al., 2016). What is worse, it requires a huge amount of memory access for GNNs i nference, e.g., the nodes features size of Reddit is up to 534MB, leading to high latency. Theref ore, the aforementioned problems pose a challenge to realize efﬁcient inference of GNNs. Neural network quantization can reduce the model size and accelerate inference without modify- ing the model architecture, which has become a promising met hod to solve this problem in re- ∗ Corresponding author 1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 /uni0000003e/uni00000014/uni0000000f/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000040/uni0000003e/uni00000014/uni00000014/uni0000000f/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000040/uni0000003e/uni00000015/uni00000014/uni0000000f/uni00000016/uni00000013/uni00000040/uni0000003e/uni00000016/uni00000014/uni0000000f/uni00000017/uni00000013/uni00000040/uni0000003e/uni00000017/uni00000014/uni0000000f/uni00000014/uni00000019/uni0000001b/uni00000040 /uni0000002c/uni00000051/uni00000010/uni00000047/uni00000048/uni0000004a/uni00000055/uni00000048/uni00000048 /uni00000013 /uni00000015 /uni00000017 /uni00000019 /uni0000001b/uni00000024/uni00000059/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni00000044/uni0000004a/uni00000048/uni00000003/uni00000029/uni00000048/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni00000058/uni00000055/uni00000048/uni0000000b/uni00000024/uni00000049/uni00000057/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni00000003/uni00000024/uni0000004a/uni0000004a/uni00000055/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000051/uni0000000c /uni0000002a/uni00000026/uni00000031 /uni0000002a/uni0000002c/uni00000031 /uni0000002a/uni00000024/uni00000037 (a) /uni0000003e/uni00000014/uni0000000f/uni00000016/uni00000013/uni00000040/uni0000003e/uni00000016/uni00000014/uni0000000f/uni0000001a/uni00000013/uni00000040/uni0000003e/uni0000001a/uni00000014/uni0000000f/uni00000014/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000040/uni0000003e/uni00000014/uni00000014/uni00000014/uni0000000f/uni00000014/uni00000018/uni00000013/uni00000040/uni0000003e/uni00000014/uni00000018/uni00000013/uni0000000f/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000040 /uni0000002c/uni00000051/uni00000010/uni00000047/uni00000048/uni0000004a/uni00000055/uni00000048/uni00000048 /uni00000013 /uni00000015/uni00000013 /uni00000017/uni00000013 /uni00000019/uni00000013 /uni0000001b/uni00000013 /uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000024/uni00000059/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni00000044/uni0000004a/uni00000048/uni00000003/uni00000029/uni00000048/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni00000058/uni00000055/uni00000048/uni0000000b/uni00000024/uni00000049/uni00000057/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni00000003/uni00000024/uni0000004a/uni0000004a/uni00000055/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000051/uni0000000c /uni0000002a/uni0000002c/uni00000031/uni00000042/uni0000002f/uni00000044/uni0000005c/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni00000015 /uni0000002a/uni0000002c/uni00000031/uni00000042/uni0000002f/uni00000044/uni0000005c/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni00000016 /uni0000002a/uni0000002c/uni00000031/uni00000042/uni0000002f/uni00000044/uni0000005c/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni00000017 /uni0000002a/uni0000002c/uni00000031/uni00000042/uni0000002f/uni00000044/uni0000005c/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni00000018 (b) Figure 1: The analysis of the average aggerated node feature s in different in-degrees node groups on various tasks.

Unfortunately, there remain some issues in the e xisting works on GNNs quantization. Feng et al. (2020) only quantizes the node feature and keeps ﬂ oating point calculations during infer- ence. T ailor et al. (2020) proposes a degree-quant training strategy to quantize GNNs to the low-bit ﬁxed point but causes a large accuracy drop, e.g., 11.1% accu racy drops when quantizing to 4bits. Moreover, some works (W ang et al., 2021b; Bahri et al., 2021; W ang et al., 2021a; Jing et al., 2021) quantize GNNs into 1-bit and compute with XNOR and bit count o perations. However, these 1-bit quantization methods are either restricted to the node-lev el tasks or can not generalize well to other GNNs. Most of the above methods do not make full use of the property o f GNNs and graph data, re- sulting in severe accuracy degradation or poor generalizat ion. As presented in MPNN framework (Gilmer et al., 2017), GNNs processing is divided into two ph ase: First, in the aggregation phase, a node collects information from neighboring nodes and uses the aggregation function to generate hidden features; second, in the update phase, the hidden fea tures are transformed into new features by an update function. W e analyze the nodes features after ag gregation in Figure 1 and ﬁnd that the higher the in-degree is, the larger the node features ten d to be after aggregation. And the fea- tures vary signiﬁcantly between nodes with different in-de grees, which represent the topology of a graph. Moreover, according to Xie et al. (2014); Aiello et al . (2001), the degrees of nodes in most real-world graph data often follow the power-law distribut ion, i.e., nodes with a low degree account for the majority of graph data. Therefore, specially quanti zing the nodes features according to the topology of the graphs will be beneﬁcial to reduce the quanti zation error while achieving a higher compression ratio. In this paper, we propose theAggregation-A ware Quantization(A2Q) method, which quantizes different nodes features with different learnable quantiz ation parameters, including bitwidth and step size. These parameters can be adaptively learned durin g training and are constrained by a penalty on memory size to improve the compression ratio. How ever, when quantizing the model in semi-supervised tasks, the gradients for most quantizat ion parameters are zero due to the sparse connections between nodes, which makes the training non-tr ivial. W e propose the Local Gradient method to solve this problem by introducing quantization er ror as supervised information. Finally, to generalize our method to unseen graphs in which the number of the nodes varies, we develop the Nearest Neighbor Strategy which assigns the learned quantization parameters to the un seen graph nodes. T o the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to introdu ce the mixed-precision quantization to the GNNs. Compared with the previous works, our proposed m ethods can signiﬁcantly compress GNNs with negligible accuracy drop. In summary, the key contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) W e propose the Aggregation-A ware mixed-precision Quant ization ( A2Q) method to enable an adaptive learning of quantization parameters. Our learn ing method is powerful by fully 2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 utilizing the characteristic of GNNs, and the learned bitwi dth is strongly related to the topology of the graph. 2) A Local Gradient method is proposed to train the quantization parameters in s emi- supervised learning tasks. Furthermore, to generalize our method to the unseen graphs in which the number of input nodes is variable, we develop the Nearest Neighbor Strategy to select quantization parameters for the nodes of the unsee n graphs. 3) Experiments demonstrate that we can achieve a compressio n ratio up to 18.6x with negli- gible accuracy degradation compared to the full-precision (FP32) models. Moreover, the model trained with our A2Q method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOT A) method up to 11.4% with a speedup up to 2.00x in semi-supervised tasks, and obtains up to 9.5% gains with a 1.16x speedup in graph-level tasks.

(2008), which attempted to generalize neur al networks to model non-Euclidean data. In the following years, various GNN models were proposed. Fo r example, Graph Convolution Net- work (GCN) (Kipf & W elling, 2016) uses a layer-wise propagat ion rule that is based on a ﬁrst-order approximation of spectral convolutions on graphs, Graph Is omorphism Network (GIN) (Xu et al., 2018) designed a provably maximally powerful GNN under the M PNN framework, and Graph At- tention Network (GA T) (V eliˇ ckovi´ c et al., 2017) introduc es the attention mechanism to graph pro- cessing. Although GNNs have encouraging performance in a wi de range of domains (Jin et al., 2020; Y ang, 2019), the huge amount of ﬂoat-point operations and memory access in process pose a challenge to efﬁcient inference, which hinder the applicat ions of GNNs. Quantized GNNs: As a promising method to reduce the model size and accelerate the inference process, quantization is also applied to GNNs. Some works qu antize features and weights in GNNs to low bitwidths (Feng et al., 2020; T ailor et al., 2020) or ev en 1-bit (W ang et al., 2021b; Bahri et al., 2021; W ang et al., 2021a; Jing et al., 2021), i.e., use ﬁxed-p oint numbers instead of ﬂoating-point numbers for computation. But when the compression ratio is h igh (e.g., <4bit), the performance degradation of these works is signiﬁcant, and the generaliz ation of 1-bit method is limited. There are also some works on vector quantization (VQ), which use th e vectors in a codebook obtained during the training process instead of the original feature s (Ding et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022). However, searching for vectors in the codebook is computati onally complex. Mixed-Precision Quantization: Based on the idea that different layers have different sensi tiv- ities to quantization, mixed-precision quantization is pr oposed in CNNs to quantize different layers to different bitwidths for better model compression. Early works (W ang et al., 2019; Lou et al., 2019) proposed reinforcement learning (RL) based methods t o search bitwidth for different lay- ers, but they often require large computational resources, which limits the exploration of the search space. Another important class of mixed-precision method i s the criteria-based method, they use the speciﬁc criteria to represent the quantization sensitivit y, e.g., (Dong et al., 2019; 2020; Chen et al., 2021)quantize different layers with different bitwidths b ased on the trace of the Hessian. Recently, there are some other methods to learn the bitwidth during tra ining (Uhlich et al., 2019; Esser et al., 2019; Jain et al., 2020). However, due to the huge difference between GNNs and CNNs, it is dif- ﬁcult to use these methods on GNNs directly, and our A2Q is the ﬁrst method to introduce the mixed-precision quantization to GNNs, further improving t he inference efﬁciency of GNNs. 3 M ETHOD In this section, we describe our proposed Aggregation-A war e Quantization in detail. Firstly, we present the formulation of the mixed-precision quantizati on for GNNs, which fully utilizes the prop- erty of GNNs and graph data. Secondly, we introduce the Local Gradient method to address the gradient vanishing problem during training. Finally, we de tail the Nearest Neighbor Strategy, which is used for generalizing our approach to the unseen graphs. 3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023  !\"\"  !\"#  !\"$   !#\"  !##  !#$   !$\"  !$#  !$$   !%\"  !%#  !%$   !&\"  !&#  !&$  !'\"  !'#  !'$ (\" (# ($ (% (& (' ) *\"\" ) *\"# ) *#\" ) *## ) *$\" ) *$# +\" ´ = ,\"\" ,\"# ,#\" ,## ,$\" ,$# ,%\" ,%# ,&\" ,&# ,'\" ,'# (\"-\" (\"-# (#-\" (#-# ($-\" ($-# (%-\" (%-# (&-\" (&-# ('-\" ('-# Nodes Features Weights   !

W e use the learnable parameters step size α i ∈ R+ and bitwidth bi ∈ R+ to quantize the features of the i-th node as: ¯xi = sign(xi)      ⌊|xi| α i + 0. 5⌋, |x| < α i(2[bi]−1 − 1) 2[bi]−1 − 1, |xi| ≥ α i(2[bi]−1 − 1) , (1) where ⌊·⌋ is the ﬂoor function, and [·] is the round function to ensure the bitwidth used to quantize is an integer. The learnable parameters are sX = ( α 1, α 2, ..., α N ), and bX = ( b1, b 2, ..., b N ). Then we can obtain the ﬁxed-point feature map ¯X, and the original feature can be represented as Xq = SX · ¯X, where SX = diag(α 1, α 2, ..., α N ). Note that we use [b] + 1 as the quantization bitwidth for the features after ReLU because the values are a ll non-negative. In the update phase, the node features are often transformed with a linear mapping or an MLP in which matrix multiplication XW is the main computation, and the transformed node features a re the input to the next layer in GNNs. In order to accelerate the update phase, we also quantize W . Due to the fact that W in a certain layer is shared by all nodes, we quantize W to the same bitwidth of 4bits for all GNNs in this paper. However, each column of W has its learnable quantization step size, i.e., sW = ( β1, β 2, .., β F2 ), where F2 is the output-dimension of the node features in current layer and βi is the quantization step size for the i-th column of W , and we also use Eq. 1 to quantize W . W e can obtain the integer representation ¯W and the quantized representation Wq = ¯W · SW , where SW = diag(β1, β 2, ..., β F2 ). The ﬂoat-point matrix multiplication in the update phase c an be reformulated as follow: X · W ≈ Xq · Wq = ( SX · ¯X) · ( ¯W · SW ) = ( ¯X · ¯W ) ⊙ (sX ⊗ sW ) , (2) where ⊙ denotes an element-wise multiplication, and ⊗ denotes the outer product. After training, we can obtain sX and sW so that the outer product can be pre-processed before infere nce. An example is illustrated in Figure 2. For the aggregation phas e, i.e., AX, A is the adjacency matrix and A ∈ { 0, 1}N×N , we quantize the X as the quantization way of W because the nodes features involved in the aggregation process come from the update pha se, in which the features lose the topology information of graphs. Then the aggregation phase can be performed by integer operations to reduce the computational overhead. The quantization parameters(s, b ) are trained by the backpropagation algorithm. Since the ﬂoo r and round functions used in the quantization process are not differentiable, we use the straight- through estimator (Bengio et al., 2013) to approximate the g radient through these functions, and the gradients of the quantization parameters can be calculated by: ∂L ∂s = d∑ i=1 ∂L ∂xi q · ∂xi q ∂s , (3) ∂L ∂b = d∑ i=1 ∂L ∂xi q · ∂xi q ∂b , (4) where d is the dimension of the vector x, (s, b ) are the quantization parameters for x, and xi q is the value of i-th dimension in xq. Detailed information about quantization process and the backpropagation are shown in Appendix A.1 and A.3 Proof 2 and 3. 4Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 In order to improve the compression ratio of the node feature s, we introduce a penalty term on the memory size: Lmemory = ( 1 η · L∑ l=1 N∑ i=1 diml ·bl i− Mtarget )2 , (5) where L is the number of layers in the GNNs, N is the total number of nodes, diml is the length of the node features in l-th layer, bl iis the quantization bitwidth for node i in l-th layer, Mtarget is the target memory size on the total node features memory size, an d η = 8 ∗ 1024, which is a constant to convert the unit of memory size to KB. Then the model and quantization parameters can be trained by the loss function: Ltotal = Ltask + λ · Lmemory , (6) where Ltask is the task-related loss function and λ is a penalty factor on Lmemory . 3.2 L O CA L GRA D IE N T Although the above end-to-end learning method is concise an d straightforward, the gradients for the quantization parameters of nodes features, i.e., ∂L task ∂s and ∂L task ∂b , are almost zero during the training process of semi-supervised tasks, which poses a si gniﬁcant challenge to train the quantiza- tion parameters for nodes features. W e analyze the property of GNNs and graph data, and ﬁnd that two reasons lead to this phenomenon: 1. The extreme sparsity of the connections between nodes in graph data. 2. Only a tiny fraction of nodes with labels are used for training in semi-supervised tasks (e.g., 0. 30% in PubMed dataset). Therefore, ∂L task ∂x q for most node features are zero (detailed proof in Appendix A.3.2), which results in that the gradient s for quantization parameters of these nodes vanish according to Eq. 3 and Eq. 4. T o clarify, we visua lize the ∂L task ∂x q in the second layer of GCN trained on Cora. As shown in Figure 3, most gradients fo r the nodes features are zero. The gradients of the Ltask w .r.t. quantized nodes features can be viewed as the supervi sed infor- mation from the labeled nodes which enable the training of th e quantization parameters for nodes features. However, this supervised information is missing due to zero gradients. Considering the quantization error is related to the Ltask, we introduce the quantization error E = 1 d |xq − x|1 as the supervised information for the quantization parameter s of nodes features, where x is the features before quantization, xq is the features after quantization and | · | 1 denotes the L1 norm. W e refer to this method as Local Gradient because the gradients are computed by the local quantizatio n er- rors instead of back-propagated task-related gradients. T hen the quantization parameters for node features can be trained by gradients from E: ∂E ∂s = 1 d d∑ i=1 sign(xi q− xi) · ∂xi q ∂s , (7) ∂E ∂b = 1 d d∑ i=1 sign(xi q− xi) · ∂xi q ∂b . (8) Note that the quantization parameters of W are still trained by utilizing the gradients in Eq. 3. 3.3 N E A RE S T NE IG H BO R ST RAT E G Y In graph-level tasks, the quantized GNNs are required to gen eralize to unseen graphs. In such a scenario, the number of input nodes may vary during training or inference. However, the learnable method can only train a ﬁxed number of (s, b ) pairs which are the same as the number of input nodes, so it is challenging to learn the s and b for every node in graph-level tasks. T o solve this problem, we propose the Nearest Neighbor Strategy , which allows learning of a ﬁxed number of quantization parameters and select quantization paramete rs for the unseen graphs. The proposed strategy is shown in Algorithm 1. T o ensure the n umerical range of xq is as close as to x at FP32, a simple way is to keep the maximum quantization valu e equal to the maximum absolute value of x. Based on this idea, we ﬁrst initialize m groups of quantization parameters, then we calculate the maximum quantization value for every group , i.e., qmax = s(2[b]−1 − 1). When quantizing the features of node i, the feature with the largest absolute value fi in the node features xi is ﬁrst selected, and then we ﬁnd the nearest qmax and quantize the node features with the (s, b ) corresponding to this qmax. When performing backpropagation, we ﬁrst calculate the gr adients of the loss function w .r.t. quantization parameters accordin g to Eq. 3 and Eq. 4. For a speciﬁc set of quantization parameters (sj , b j), we collect the gradients from the nodes that have used them 5Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Algorithm 1 Nearest Neighbor Strategy 1: ForwardPass (X = ( x1, x2, ..., xN )T ): 2: Initialize(s, b), s ∈ Rm×1 + , b ∈ Rm×1 + before training 3: Calculate qmax = s ⊙ (2b−1 − 1) 4: Calculate the maximum absolute value in the features of each node: fi = max j abs(x(j) i ) 5: Search the index of quantization parameters for each node: indexi = arg min k |fi − qk max| 6: Quantize the i-th node features using (sindexi , b indexi ) 7: return Xq 8: end T able 1: The results comparison on node-level tasks.

And we compare our method with the FP32 GNN model and DQ-INT4 ( T ailor et al., 2020) on eight datasets, including four node-level semi-learning t asks (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed, ogbn-arxiv) (Hu et al., 2020; Y ang et al., 2016) and four graph-level task s (REDDIT -BINAR Y , MNIST , CI- F AR10, ZINC) (Y anardag & V ishwanathan, 2015; Dwivedi et al. , 2020), to demonstrate the gen- erality and robustness of our method. Among these datasets, ZINC is a dataset for regression tasks, which uses regression loss as the metric of the model perform ance, while others are all for classiﬁ- cation tasks. For a fair comparison, we set the quantization bitwidth ofW for all GNNs to 4bits as DQ-INT4. W e count the average bitwidths for nodes features in all layers of the overall model and list them in our 6Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 T able 2: The results comparison on graph-level tasks.

Since today’s CPUs and G PUs can not support mixed-precision operations well, we implement a precision-scalable hardwa re accelerator to perform the overall in- ference process for GNN. The accelerator employs massive bi t-serial multipliers Judd et al. (2016), therefore, the latency of the integer multiplications is de termined by the bitwidth of the node fea- tures. T o evaluate the performance gains of our method over D Q-INT4, we develop a cycle-accurate simulator for our accelerator. More details about accelera tor architecture are shown in Appendix A.7.5. Moreover, we show the compression ratio of quantized GNNs compared to the FP32 models in terms of overall memory size. For simplicity, we use GNN(D Q) to represent the GNNs quantized by DQ-INT4 and GNN-dataset to represent the task in which we r un the experiment, e.g., GCN- Cora represents the GCN model trained on Cora. Detailed info rmation about datasets and settings is in Appendix A.5 and Appendix A.6. 4.2 N O D E -L E V E L TA S K S T able 1 shows the experimental results on three GNN architec tures trained on four node-level datasets. Compared with DQ-INT4, our method can achieve sig niﬁcantly better accuracy on each task, even with a higher compression ratio, improving the in ference performance with 1.28x to 2.00x speedups. On almost all node-level tasks, our proposed A2Q has negligible accuracy drop compared to the FP32 baselines while achieving 12.1x-18.6x compress ion ratio. Since both GIN and GA T in- volve more complex computations, such as the calculation of attention coefﬁcients in GA T , it is more challenging to quantize those models, and DQ performs p oorly on these two models. How- ever, our method can overcome this problem and maintain comp arable accuracy compared with the FP32 models. Our method can outperform the DQ-INT4 by 11.4% o n the GA T -Cora task with a smaller bitwidth (2.03 v.s. 4). Even on ogbn-arxiv, which ha s a large number of nodes, A2Q can achieve a 12.1x compression ratio compared with FP32 baseli ne with comparable accuracy, which demonstrates the robustness of our method. Moreover, to dem onstrate the generality of our method, we also evaluate our method on heterogeneous graphs and the i nductive learning tasks and compare with more related works in Appendix A.7.1. 4.3 G RA P H -L E V E L TA S K S T able 2 presents the comparison results on the graph-level t asks.

Even for graph datasets with similar in-degrees, s uch as MNIST and CIF AR10, our method also learns the appropriate bitwidths for higher compressi on ratio and better accuracy. Although on GIN-MINST task, the improvement of our method is relatively small due to the similarity of the in- degrees between different nodes, our method can achieve com parable accuracy with smaller bitwidth (3.75 v.s. 4). 4.4 A NA LY S IS T o understand why our approach works, we analyze the relatio nship between the learned bitwidths and the topology of the graph. Figure 4(a) and 4(b) reveal tha t the bitwidth learned by A2Q is strongly related to the topology of graph data in the node-le vel tasks. As the bitwidth increases, the average in-degrees of nodes become larger. In other word s, A2Q method tends to learn higher bitwidth for nodes with higher in-degrees. However, in GA T , as shown in Figure 4(c), the learned bits are irregular. This is because the features aggregated in GA T are topology-free. However, our method can still learn appropriate quantization bitwid ths for different nodes, which improves accuracy while reducing memory usage. In addition, Figure 4 also shows the node distribution for different bitwidths and the result is consistent with power -law distribution. Since nodes in graph data mainly have low in-degrees, most of the nodes are quantized t o low bitwidth ( ≤ 4), compressing the GNNs as much as possible. And there are also some high in-d egree nodes quantized to high bitwidth, which can help to maintain the accuracy of the GNN m odels. As a result, the average bitwidth of the entire graph features is low , and the accurac y degradation is negligible. For the graph-level tasks in which the number of nodes varies , our method is also aggregation- aware. W e select a layer of GIN trained on REDDIT -BINAR Y and a nalyze the relationship between bitwidth and average in-degrees of nodes using the correspo nding bitwidth to quantize in Figure 4(d) and 4(e). It can be seen that the bitwidth learned for nod es features input to the second layer of MLP , which is the update function in GIN for graph-level task s, does not present a correlation with the topology of graph. W e analyze the reason and ﬁnd that the n ode features before the second layer is the result mapped by the ﬁrst layer of MLP and is activated b y the activation function, e.g., ReLU, which results in the node features losing the topology infor mation. W e present more experiment results in Appendix A.7. to demonstrate that our method is ge nerally applicable. 5 A BLATION STUDY The advantage of learning-based mixed-precision quantiza tion: In Figure 5, we compare our A2Q with the manual mixed-precision method, which manually ass igns high-bit to those nodes with high in-degrees and low-bit to those nodes with low in-degre es. In the ﬁgure, the postﬁx “learn” denotes that using A2Q method, “manual” denotes that we assign bits to nodes and the model only learns the stepsize, and “mixed-precision” denotes that th e model uses the same quantization method as DQ-INT4 but assigning different bitwidths to nodes. For t he “mixed-precision”, we assign 5bits to those nodes with 50% top in-degrees and assign 3bits to oth ers. The implications are two-fold. First, compared with the DQ-INT4, which uses the same quanti zation bitwidth, the mixed-precision 8Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 T able 3: Ablation Study.

W e can see that learning the step size can signiﬁcantly increas e the accuracy and even the “no-lr-bit” model can outperform the DQ-INT4 at the same compression rat io. When learning the bitwidth and step size simultaneously, the model can achieve higher accu racy with a higher compression ratio. This is because our method learns lower bitwidths for most no des with low in-degrees and higher bitwidths for a tiny fraction of nodes with high in-degrees, which can improve the compression ratio while achieving higher accuracy. Local Gradient v .s. Global Gradient:T o demonstrate the effectiveness of our Local Gradient method, we compare the models trained with and without it on t he GCN-CiteSeer task in the last row of T able 3. The “Global” denotes that the model is trained with Eq. 3 and Eq. 4. The model trained with the local method outperforms the global method by 13.8% with a higher compression ratio. This is because the Local Gradient method can learn qu antization parameters for all nodes, while only quantization parameters for a part of nodes can be updated with the Global Gradient method due to the extreme sparse connection in the graph on th e node-level semi-supervised tasks. The overhead of Nearest Neighbor Strategy:W e evaluate the real inference time of the GIN model on the 2080ti GPU. On REDDIT -BINAR Y task, the model without t he selection process requires 121.45ms, while it takes 122.60ms for the model with our Near est Neighbor Strategy, which only introduces 0.95% overhead. But with the help of the Nearest N eighbor Strategy, our model can obtain 19.3% accuracy gains for quantized GIN on REDDIT -BIN AR Y . 6 C ONCLUSIO N This paper proposes A2Q, an aggregation-aware mixed-precision quantization meth od for GNNs, and introduces the Local Gradient and Nearest Neighbor Stra tegy to generalize A2Q to the node- level and graph-level tasks, respectively. Our method can l earn the quantization parameters for different nodes by fully utilizing the property of GNNs and g raph data. The model quantized by our A2Q can achieve up to a 18.6x compression ratio, and the accuracy degradation is negligible compared with the FP32 baseline. Compared with the prior SOT A, DQ-INT4, our method can signiﬁcantly improve 11.4% accuracy with up to a 2.00x speed up on different tasks. Our work provides a general, robust and feasible solution to speed up the inference of GNNs. 9Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 REFERENC ES Radhakrishna Achanta, Appu Shaji, Kevin Smith, Aurelien Lu cchi, Pascal Fua, and Sabine S ¨ usstrunk.

A.1.1 Q UA N T IZ AT IO N PRO CE S S For a vector x, the xq is a quantized representation. Given the quantization step size s, s ∈ R+, and the quantization bitwidth b, b ∈ N+, then the uniform quantization is implemented as: ¯x = sign(x)      ⌊|x| s + 0. 5⌋, |x| < s (2b−1 − 1) 2b−1 − 1, |x| ≥ s(2b−1 − 1) . (9) The x at 32bits is mapped to the integer number set {−2b−1 + 1 , ..., 0, ..., 2b−1 − 1} where the bitwidth is #b bits, and the quantized representation can be calculated as xq = s · ¯x. For inference, ¯x can be used to compute matrix multiplication in the update ph ase or perform other computations in GNNs layers and the output of these computations then are r escaled by the corresponding s using a relatively lower cost scalar-vector multiplication. As a n illustrative example, for vectors x ∈ R3×1 and y ∈ R3×1, the quantization parameters are both s = 0 . 1, b = 5 , the process of inner product between these two vectors by integers is shown in Figure 6. Wh en the values in a vector are all non-negative, we do not need to represent the sign bit in the ﬁ xed-point representation. Therefore, the value can use #b bits to quantize instead of using the ﬁrst bit to represent th e sign bit. Then the quantization range of uniform quantization is [−s(2b − 1), s (2b − 1)]. 0.11 - 0.21 1.29 0.31  0.58 -0.27  -0.436 1 - 2 13  3 6 -3 -48   ! = 0.1  \" = 0.1Preform by float-point representation  Perform by integers representation  -48  Rescale  -48  ! \" -0.48  × = × = × = 0.11 (0.11) 0.5 1 0.1 sign ê ú ´ + = ê ú  ë û  0.21( 0.21) 0.5 2 0.1sign ê - ú - ´ + = - ê ú  ë û  5 1 0.1 (2 1) 1.5 -´ - =  Quantization process  Figure 6: An example of performing inner product by integers representation. A.1.2 G RA D IE N T IN BACK P RO PAG AT IO N Due to the ﬂoor function used in the quantization process is n ot differentiable, the gradient of xq with respect to x vanishes almost everywhere, which makes it impossible to tr ain the model by the backpropagation algorithm. Therefore, we use the straight -through estimator (Bengio et al., 2013) to approximate the gradient through the ﬂoor function, i.e., ∂L ∂x = ∂L ∂x q I|x|≤s(2b−1), where I|x|≤s(2b−1) is a indicator function, whose value is 1 when |x| ≤ s(2b − 1), and vice versa. In our paper, the quantiﬁcation parameters (s, b ) are learnable, the gradients of xq w .r.t. (s, b ) used in Eq. 3 and Eq. 4 are:   ∂x q ∂s ∂x q ∂b  =        [ 1 s (xq − x) 0 ] , |x| < s (2b−1 − 1) sign(x) [ ( 2b−1 − 1 ) 2b−1 ln (2) s ] , |x| ≥ s(2b−1 − 1) .

A graph G = ( V, E) consist of nodes V = {1, ..., N } and edges E ⊆ V × V has node features X ∈ RN×F and optionally H-dimensional edge features E ∈ RE×H . The MPNN framework can be formulated by x(l) i = γ(l)(x(l−1) i , □ j∈N (i) φ(l)(x(l−1) i , x(l−1) j , e(l−1) ij )), where φ is a differentiable kernel function, □ is the aggregation function which is permutation-invarian t, and the γ is a learnable update function, xi is the features of node i and eij is the features of edge between node i and j, N (i) = {j : ( i, j ) ∈ E} , and l represents the l-th layer of the GNNs. In this paper, we focus on three typical GNN models whose forw ardpass all can be represented by the MPNN framework, Graph Convolution Network (GCN) (Kip f & W elling, 2016), Graph Iso- morphism Network (GIN) (Xu et al., 2018), and Graph Attentio n Network (GA T) (V eliˇ ckovi´ c et al., 2017). the detailed information is shown in T able 4. A.3 P RO O F S O F TH E O RE T ICA L RE S U LT S This section provides formal proof of the theoretical resul ts of our paper. A.3.1 N OTAT IO N S Here, we deﬁne the notations utilized in our proof. A = {0, 1}N×N is the adjacency matrix that indicates whether there is an edge between each pair of nodes , e.g., if there is an edge between node i and node j, then aij = 1 , otherwise, aij = 0 . Then, ˜A = A + I is the adjacency matrix for a graph 14Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 that is added to the self-loops. The degree matrix D = diag(d1, d 2, ..., d n), where di = ∑ j aij and the degree matrix for the graph having self-loops is ˜D = ( ˜d1, ˜d2, ..., ˜dn), where ˜di = ∑ j ˜aij. A.3.2 P RO O F S Proof 1. The gradients of the loss function with respect to the node fe atures in semi-supervised tasks are most zero. Without loss of generality, we use the GCN model as an example. From the T able 4, the graph convolution operation can be described as X(l+1) = σ( ˆAX(l)W (l)), (11) where ˆA = ˜D− 1 2 ˜A ˜D− 1 2 , is the normalized adjacency matrix, W (l) ∈ RFin×Fout is a learnable weight matrix in the l-th layer of GCN. X(l) is the input of the l-th layer and the output of the (l − 1)-th layer in GCN. σ is the non-linear activation function, e.g., ReLU. Note tha t the ˆA is an extreme sparse matrix for node-level datasets in our paper. In our training process of the model, we usenll loss as our task loss function L. Only the nodes in the train set T have labels. For the last layer of GCN, we get the node feature s to be classiﬁed by H(l+1) = softmax(X(l+1)). Then the gradient of L with respect to X(l+1) is G1 = ∇X(l+1) L = ∂L ∂H(l+1) · ∂H(l+1) ∂X(l+1) = [ lij ] ∈ RN×Fout , (12) where only the G1 i,:, i ∈ T is not zero, otherwise, G1 i,: = 0 . Then, the gradient of the loss function with respect to X(l) is G2 = ∇X(l) L = ˆAT (∇X(l+1) L ⊙ σ′( ˆAX(l)W (l)))(W (l))T . (13) For node j do not have an edge with the node i, i ∈ T , G2 j,: = 0 . T able 5 lists the density of the adjacency matrix A and the percentage of the labeled nodes in four node-level da tasets. Because the sparsity property of adjacency matrix and the nodes with trained labels only account for a tiny fraction of the graph, the gradients from the loss function f or most node features are zero. Proof 2. The normalized adjacency matrix ˆA is not needed to be quantized for the GCN model. W e take the process of XW → A(XW ) as an illustrative example, which represents ﬁrst calculat e the B = XW and then calculate AB. For the l-th layer of FP32 models, the ﬁrst stage is Bl = XlWl, and then calculate the Xl+1 = ˆABl, where Xl ∈ RN×F1 , Wl ∈ RF1×F2 and A ∈ RN×N . The step-size for Bl, Xl and Wl is SBl , SXl and SWl , respectively. And they are all diagonal matrices. The integer representations are calculated as Bl = Bl qSBl , Xl = SXl Xl q and Wl = Wl qSWl . Note that for the node-level tasks, we can obtain the SBl , SXl and SWl in advance. And for the graph-level tasks, we can obtain them through one mor e element-wise multiplication whose overhead is negligible, as the comparison in T able 6. Then th e ﬁrst stage is: Bl = Xl · Wl = ( SXl · Xl q) · (Wl q · SWl ) , (14) and there exists Bl = Bl qSBl . Therefore, the integers representation for the next stage can be calculated as: Bl q = BlS−1 Bl = ( SXl · Xl q) · (Wl q · SWl )S−1 Bl = ( SXl · Xl q) · (Wl q · (SWl S−1 Bl )) = ( SXl ⊗ (SWl S−1 Bl )) ⊙ (Xl q · Wl q) , (15) where the (SXl ⊗ (SWl S−1 Bl )) can be calculated ofﬂine. Then we obtain the ﬁxed-point repr esenta- tion Bl q for the next stage and do not introduce overhead. The process of node degree normalization after the aggregat ion process can be represented as Xl+1 = σ( ˆABl), where ˆA = D− 1 2 ˜AD− 1 2 is the normalized adjacency matrix, and σ is the 15Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Figure 7: The pipeline of the quantization process on our acc elerator. non-linear activation function. D− 1 2 at the right side of ˜A can be fused into the SXl and then calculate Bl q as Eq. 15. Then the features of the (l + 1) -th layer Xl+1 can be obtained as Xl+1 = σ(D− 1 2 ˜ABl q). And there exits Xl+1 = SXl+1 X(l+1) q. Therefore, the X(l+1) q can be obtained as: X(l+1) q = S−1 Xl+1 Xl+1 = S−1 Xl+1 σ(D− 1 2 ˜ABl q) . (16) Note that the elements in diagonal matrix SXl+1 are all positive because this matrix is made up of step-size, which is always positive. Then we can obtain X(l+1) q = σ(S−1 Xl+1 D− 1 2 ˜ABl q) , where S−1 Xl+1 D− 1 2 can be obtained before inference and ˜A ∈ { 0, 1}N×N . The computation of ˜ABl q only has addition operations and the S−1 Xl+1 D− 1 2 can be obtained before inference for node-level tasks or introduce only once more element-wise multiplication to ca lculate for the graph-level tasks. The D− 1 2 at the left side is fused into the element-wise multiplicati on performed by the next layer and the D− 1 2 at the right side is fused into the element-wise multiplicat ion performed by the current layer and the element-wise multiplication is a necessary st age in the quantized model. Therefore, we can perform the node degree normalization using ﬁxed point a ddition operation instead of quantizing the normalized adjacency matrix which may introduce more qu antization error. Proof 3. The quantization process can be fused with Batch Normalizat ion operations. When GNNs have Batch Normalization (BN) Layers, the calcula tion process is as follows (Note that we have fused the mean and standard-deviation with the l earned parameters in BN): Xl+1 = BN (σ( ˆABl q)) = σ( ˆABl q)Y + Z , (17) where Y = diag(y1, y 2, ..., y F2 ) ∈ RF2×F2 , Z = ( z1, z2, ..., zF2 ) ∈ RN×F2 and zi = (θi, θ i, ..., θ i)T ∈ RN among which yi and θi are the BN parameters for the i-th dimension fea- ture of the nodes features. And there exits that Xl+1 = SXl+1 Xl+1 q. Therefore, Xl+1 q = S−1 Xl+1 Xl+1 = S−1 Xl+1 (σ( ˆABl q)Y + Z) = ( S−1 Xl+1 ⊗ Y ) ⊙ (σ( ˆABl q)) + S−1 Xl+1 Z . (18) Through Eq. 18, we can fuse the quantization of the next layer into the BN operation of the cur- rent layer, which will not introduce overhead because the BN layer itself requires ﬂoating point operations. Note that the ﬂoat point operations are also ele ment-wise. 16Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 T able 6: The comparison between ﬁxed-point operations and ﬂ oat-point operations for some tasks using the Nearest Neighbor Strategy.

As t he pipeline is shown in Figure 7, we fuse the (NNS) with the following operations. The ﬁxed-po int results produced by the previous stage are used to ﬁrst multiply the corresponding step-size from the previous stage (an element- wise ﬂoat point multiplication) and then execute the NNS pro cess. After getting the step-size, these features are quantized immediately (an element-wise ﬂoat p oint multiplication). Therefore, through this fusion way, we do not need the extra memory to store a copy of FP32 features. In addition, the overhead of the NNS is from one more element- wise ﬂoat point multiplication and the search process. W e provide a comparison of the number of ﬂ oat-point operations and ﬁxed-point operations for different graph-level tasks in T able 6, wher e ‘Fixed-point’ denotes the ﬁxed-point op- eration, ‘Float-point’ denotes the ﬂoat-point operation a nd the ‘Ratio’ denotes the percentage of the ﬂoat-point operations in the overall process. The extra ﬂoa t-point operations introduced by NNS is only a tiny fraction of the ﬁxed-point operations. On the oth er hand, through our optimized pipeline and the comparator array used in our accelerator the latency introduced by the search process of the NNS can be overlapped. Therefore, the overhead introduced b y NNS is negligible. A.5 D ATA S E T S W e show the statistics for each dataset used in our work in T ab le 7.

The target is to classify each node in the graph cor- rectly. The Cora, CiteSeer and PubMed are from Y ang et al. (2016). The ogbn-arxiv, ogbl-mag and ogbn-collab are from Hu et al. (2020). The Flickr is from Zeng et al. (2019). The Reddit is from Hamilton et al. (2017). In graph-level tasks, REDDIT -BINARY(Y anardag & V ishwanathan, 2015) is a balanced dataset where each graph corresponds to a n online discussion thread and the nodes correspond to users. There would be an edge between two nodes if at least one of them responded to another’s comment. The task is then to identify whether a given graph belongs to a question/answer-based community or a discussion-based co mmunity The MNIST and CIF AR-10 datasets (Dwivedi et al., 2020) which are often used for imag e classiﬁcation tasks are transformed into graphs in which every node is represented by their super pixel and location, and the edges are constructed by Achanta et al. (2012). The task is to classify the image using its graph representation. The ZINC G ´ omez-Bombarelli et al. (2018) dataset contains graphs re presenting molecules, where each node is an atom. The task is to regress the penalized logP (also called constrained solubility in some works) of a given graph. In Figure 8, we show the in-deg ree distribution for all the datasets we use in our paper. A.6 E X P E RIM E N TA L SE T U P T o make a fair comparison, we adopt the same GNN architecture s as T ailor et al. (2020) on every task, and the FP32 baseline is also the same. For those tasks t hat T ailor et al. (2020) does not do, we adopt the same architecture as their FP32 version.

(2020) a nd Kipf & W elling (2016) respectively. W e use standard splits for MNIST , CIF AR-10, and ZINC (Dwived i et al., 2020). For Cora, CiteSeer and PubMed, we use the splits used by Y ang et al. (2016). For REDDIT -BINA R Y , we use 10-fold cross-validation. Our data split way is also the same as DQ-I NT4. Figure 9 shows the architectures of the models used in our eva luations, including the layers, the number of hidden units, and whether to use a skip connection. Our method is implemented using PyT orch Geometric (Fey & Lenssen, 2019). W e quantize the same parts as the DQ-INT4 in all models except for the normali zed adjacency matrix in the GCN model, which we have proven that the quantization of this mat rix is not necessary in Appendix A.3.2, proof 2.. The values in the Cora and CiteSeer are all 0 or 1, therefore, we do not quantize the input features for the ﬁrst layer of the GNNs trained on the two data sets as DQ. For all quantized GNNs, we train them by Adam optimizer. The learning rate and the lea rning rate schedule are consistent with their FP32 version. In our method, the quantization par ameters (s, b ) are also learnable, so we set the learning rate for them, including the b for features, s for features, and s for weights. When initializing, the parameters of the models are initial ized as their FP32 version, the quantization bits for all nodes and weight matrixes are initialized by 4bi ts, and the step sizes for node features and weights are initialized by s ∈ N (0. 01, 0. 01) except for the graph-level tasks on GA T , where we initialize the step size by s ∈ U (0, 1). The N is normal distribution and the U is uniform distribution. And for GA T model trained on graph-level data sets, we just learn the quantization bits of the node features, while in the attention coefﬁcients com putation part, we use the exact 4bit to quantize. The batch size is 128 in all graph-level tasks. The results reported in our work for GNNs on Cora, CiteSeer and PubMed are averaged over 100 runs with different seeds, and the resu lts for ogbn-arxiv, MNIST, CIF AR-10and ZINC are averaged over ten runs. The results on REDDIT - BINARY are obtained by 10-fold cross-validation and the split seed is 12345, which is the same as DQ-INT4. All experiments in our paper ran on R TX 2080Ti GPU driven by Ubuntu 18.04. The version of the CUDA and Pytorch are 10.2 and 1.8.0, respectiv ely.

In the model trained by the bit assign- ment method, the bit is not learnable, and other hyperparame ters are all consistent with the model using the A2Q method. For the “GCN-Cora-mixed-precision” and “GIN-Cite Seer-mixed-precision” tasks, we use 3bit and 5bit to quantize the GNNs while keeping the average bitwidth at 4bits.

The overhead of Nearest Neighbor Strategy:The model, without using the Nearest Neighbor Strategy, selects the quantization parameters according t o their in-degrees. Every in-degree has a corresponding group of quantization parameters. Those nod es whose in-degrees are larger than 1000 will share the same group quantization parameters.

On the GA T -ogbn-arxiv task, our GPU raised the Out Of Memory error, so we do not report the resu lts on the GA T -ogbn-arxiv task. The model quantized by our A2Q method is also signiﬁcantly better than DQ-INT4, which show s that our A2Q is general. W e do not compare with DQ-INT8 because our result s are comparable with the FP32 baseline with a much larger compression ratio than D Q-INT8. W e also show the relationship between bit and average in-deg rees of nodes using the corresponding bitwidth to quantize on more tasks in Figure 10. W e present th e results of the ﬁnal layer of GNNs. The results show that the bitwidth learned by our A2Q method is also aggregation-aware, which means that our method is robust. W e also evaluate the inductive model, GraphSage, on some other node-level tasks to demonstrate the generality of our method on inductive learning tasks. Du e to the sampling operation in the GraphSage model, the subgraph input to the model varies, we a pply our nearest neighbor strategy to these tasks, i.e., GraphSage-Flickr and GraphSage-Reddit . In addition, we evaluate our method on more datasets, such as the ogbn-mag and ogbl-collab. ogbn-m ag is a heterogeneous graph and the ogbl-collab is used for the link prediction tasks. The results of our experiments are presented in T able 9, where we can see that our approach still works well and even brings some generalization performance improvement while signiﬁcantly com- pressing the model size. This also demonstrates that our Nei ghbor Nearest Strategy generalizes well on inductive models for node-level tasks. W e also compare with more quantization methods on GNNs. Zhaoet al. (2020) uses the Network Architecture Search (NAS) to search for the best quantizati on strategy for different components in the GNNs. Brennan et al. (2020) explore the use of half-preci sion (i.e., FP16) in the forward and backward passes of GNNs. T able 10 presents the comparison re sults on various tasks with these two methods. ‘Half-pre’ denotes the method in Brennan et al. (2020), and ‘LPGNAS’ denotes the method in Zhao et al. (2020). The results demonstrate that ou r method achieves better accuracy with a smaller quantization bitwidth on all tasks. A.7.2 G RA P H -L E V E L TA S K S W e propose the Nearest Neighbor Strategy to quantize the nod e features in graph-level tasks, in which the number of nodes input to models is various. In our Ne arest Neighbor Strategy, #m groups quantization parameters (s, b ) should be initialized, and we explore the effect of the value of m on the performance of the quantized model in T able 11 using the G IN trained on REDDIT -BINAR Y dataset. W e can observe that when the value of m is smaller than 800, the accuracy increases as the value of m increases. When the value of m is higher than 800, the performances of the models with different m are similar. However, the models with a larger m are more stable. Moreover, the selection of m may be related to the number of nodes input to the model. Accor ding to our experiments, we ﬁnally select m as 1000 for all graph-level tasks. T able 12 lists the comparison results on GIN-ZINC and GA T -ZI NC. On the regression tasks, our method is also signiﬁcantly better than DQ-INT4. Notably, w e do not learn different bitwidths for the nodes in ZINC datasets due to the similar topology struct ure between nodes. 22Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 T able 12: The results comparison on GIN-ZINC and GA T -ZINC.

Figure 12: The relationship between bit and average in-degr ees of nodes using the corresponding bitwidth to quantize on different layers of GIN trained on CI F AR10. W e also show the relationship between bit and average in-deg ree of nodes using the correspond- ing bit to quantize for more graph-level tasks in different l ayers immediately after the aggregation phase in Figure 11-Figure 16. The quantization bitwidths le arned for graph-level tasks are also aggregation-aware. Because the difference of the in-degre es between different nodes is little in the MNIST and CIF AR10 dataset resulting in the aggregated fe atures are similar between different nodes, the relationship between learned bitwidths and the i n-degrees is irregular in some layers, e.g., the 2-nd layer in GCN trained on MNIST . 23Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023

As shown in T able 13, our method can also maintain the performance with a high compression ratio for the model with different layers compared with the FP32 model. In addition, we observe that the learned quantization bitwidth increases with the number of layers. W e analysis the average bitwidth used by 2nd to 5th layer for t he ﬁve layers GCN model in Figure 17. Our method learns a higher bitwidth for the deeper layer. Due to the over-smooth phenomenon that exists in the deep layer, the embedding features of diff erent nodes are similar in the deep layer. Therefore, we consider the deeper layer may need a higher qua ntization bitwidth to distinguish the embedding features of different nodes. The impact of skip connection on quantization performance:The ﬁrst column denoted by ‘With- out skip connection’ and the second column denoted by ‘With s kip connection’ of 18 present the comparison results for different layers GCN on Cora dataset s without skip connection and with skip connection, respectively. For the model with skip connecti on, our method is also effective. Our method learns a higher bitwidth for the deeper layer. Due to t he over-smooth phenomenon that ex- ists in the deep layer, we consider that the deeper layer may n eed a higher quantization bitwidth to distinguish the embedding features of different nodes. and the higher learned quantization bitwidth for deeper layers also alleviate quantization error. And co mpared to the quantized model with a skip connection, the learned quantization bitwidths are hi gher for the quantized model without skip connection. Figure 18 presents that the quantization error s of the model with skip connection are always higher than the model without skip connection in ever y layer which means that the model without skip connection is more sensitive to the quantizati on error. Therefore, a higher quantization bitwidth is necessary for the model without skip connection to maintain the performance. W e will add these analyses to the appendix in the revision. Scalability for models that use other aggregation functions: T o demonstrate that our method is also helpful to the GNNs using other aggregation functions r ather than the sum function, we replace the aggregation function of the GIN model, which is based on t he MPNN framework with mean and max functions, and we conduct the comparison experiment on t he Cora dataset.

W e analyze the average features for different aggregation functions i n different in-degrees group in Figure 19. The average features of the sum and max functions are highly d ependent on in-degrees. The other insight is that the variance of the features is also highly de pendent on in-degrees. The analysis demonstrates the generality of our approach, w hich can capture differences between nodes introduced by topology information of graphs and comp ress the model size as much as possi- ble while maintaining the performance. A.7.4 C O M PA RIS O N WIT H BINA RY QUA N T IZ AT IO N ME T H O D In this section, we show the advantages of our method over the binary quantization method for GNNs. W e select the binary quantization method in W ang et al. (2021b) as our baseline. W e just ran the experiments on the node-level because the binary quanti zation method only supports node-level tasks, which is one of the drawbacks of the binary quantizati on method in GNNs. W e quantize the same part as W ang et al. (2021b) does for a fair comparison. The comparison results are shown in T able 16. The binary quantization method performs well on GCN, where the aggregation and update phases are simple. How ever, on both models, GA T and GIN, the accuracy drops signiﬁcantly compared with the FP32 baseline, which makes the deploy- ment unrealistic. However, our method is immune to this prob lem, although it has to use a higher average bit for node features which we believe is necessary f or GA T and GIN. In summary, our method outperforms the binary quantization method in two wa ys: 1. Our method can quantize more complex GNN models and ensure th e accuracy degradation is negligible compared with the FP32 baseline while achieving a high compression ratio of 13.4x- 19.9x. 2.Our method can be applied to graph-level tasks. However, the binary quantization method can not handle them. 27Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Edge Buffer  Weight Buffer  Output Buffer  Input Buffer  Decode Control Unit  DRAM  Data Control signal  MAC …MAC MAC  MAC …MAC MAC  MAC …MAC MAC  MAC …MAC MAC  PE (a) 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1Features  Weights  = 1 0 1 1023 hh h 1 0 1 1122 hh 1 0 1 1021 hh 1 0 1 1120 hh + + + = 55  0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 + reg  <<  & (b) Figure 20: (a) The overview of our accelerator architecture .

A.7.5 A CCE L E RATO R ARCH IT E CT U RE In this section, we introduce the architecture of our hardwa re accelerator designed for GNN infer- ence. As presented in Section 3.1, we quantize each node feat ure to an appropriate precision and ﬁx the weights to 4bits. T o support mixed-precision computa tion, we adopt bit-serial multipliers at the core. Speciﬁcally, we follow the methodology in Judd et a l. (2016) to only serialize the node features. This way, it takes m cycles to complete the multiplication between an m-bit node feature with a 4bit weight, as shown in Figure 20(b). The product invo lving 2n is implemented by left-shift, i.e., for 2n × a, we can shift a left by n bits to implement the product. T o increase the computationa l throughput, we use 256 × 16 MACs which can process 256 16-dimensional features in paral lel. As shown in Figure 20(a), the compute unit is composed of 256 P rocessing Engines (PEs), each containing a row of 16 MACs. The architecture of the MAC is sho wn in Figure 20(b). The on-chip memory consists of an Edge Buffer, which stores t he adjacency matrix of graphs, a W eight Buffer, which stores the weight of the GNNs, an Input B uffer, and an Output Buffer to store the input features and the output result, and the regis ter of each MAC to store the partial sum. T o reduce data movement in the memory hierarchy, the input bu ffer and output buffer work in a swapped fashion, as the output of the current layer is the inp ut to the next layer. W e set the memory size of Input Buffer, Output Buffer, Edge Buffer, and the W ei ght Buffer to 2MB, 2MB, 256KB, and 256KB, respectively. The overview of our architecture is sh own in Figure 20(a). T o calculate Bl = XlW l, 256 consecutive rows in Xl and a column of W l are mapped onto the MAC array to compute 256 inner products in each phase. T o a chieve this, a column of W l is broadcast and shared among PEs. The results of the inner prod ucts are written to the output buffer, which can be reused to reduce the off-chip DRAM access. The ca lculation of Xl+1 = ABl is also in a inner-product manner. In this scenario, A is a sparse matrix. W e therefore represent A in the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format, where full zero rows or elements of A are eliminated. During inference, consecutive compressed rows of A and a column of Bl are mapped onto the MAC array in each phase. W e also sort the nodes in descending o rder according to their in-degrees, and the nodes with similar in-degrees are processed in paral lel simultaneously to alleviate the load imbalance problem when performing the aggregation operati ons. A.7.6 E N E RG Y EFFICIE N CY ANA LY S IS Our method can save energy cost signiﬁcantly from the follow ing two aspects: 1. By compressing the model size as much as possible, e.g., 18 .6x compression ratio on GCN-Cora as shown in T able 1, our method can signiﬁcantly reduce the me mory footprints. Figure 21 presents the energy table for the 45nm technology node. It shows that m emory access consumes further more energy than arithmetic operations. Therefore, the memory f ootprints domains the energy cost, and then compressing the model can save much energy cost. 2. Through our quantization method and the accelerator, themodel can perform inference using the ﬁxed-point operations instead of ﬂoat-point operations, w hich are much more energy-consuming 28Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Figure 21: The energy table for 45nm technology node(Han et al., 2016; Sze et al., 2020). /uni0000002a/uni00000026/uni00000031/uni00000010/uni00000026/uni00000052/uni00000055/uni00000044/uni0000002a/uni0000002c/uni00000031/uni00000010/uni00000026/uni0000004c/uni00000057/uni00000048/uni00000036/uni00000048/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni0000002a/uni00000024 /uni00000037 /uni00000010/uni00000033/uni00000058/uni00000045/uni00000030/uni00000048/uni00000047/uni0000002a/uni00000026/uni00000031/uni00000010/uni00000030/uni00000031/uni0000002c/uni00000036/uni00000037/uni0000002a/uni00000024 /uni00000037 /uni00000010/uni00000026/uni0000002c/uni00000029 /uni00000024/uni00000035/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni0000002a/uni0000002c/uni00000031/uni00000010/uni00000035/uni00000028/uni00000010/uni00000025/uni0000002c/uni0000002a/uni00000048/uni00000052/uni00000003/uni00000030/uni00000048/uni00000044/uni00000051 /uni00000037 /uni00000044/uni00000056/uni0000004e/uni00000056 /uni00000013 /uni00000018 /uni00000014/uni00000013 /uni00000014/uni00000018 /uni00000015/uni00000013 /uni00000015/uni00000018 /uni00000016/uni00000013 /uni00000016/uni00000018 /uni00000017/uni00000013 /uni00000028/uni00000051/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni0000004a/uni0000005c/uni00000003/uni00000028/uni00000049/uni00000049/uni0000004c/uni00000046/uni0000004c/uni00000048/uni00000051/uni00000046/uni0000005c/uni0000000b/uni00000029/uni0000002f/uni00000032/uni00000033/uni00000056/uni00000012/uni0000002d/uni0000000c /uni00000015/uni00000015/uni00000011/uni00000018× /uni00000016/uni00000016/uni00000011/uni00000014× /uni00000017/uni00000011/uni00000018× /uni00000018/uni00000011/uni00000018× /uni0000001c/uni00000011/uni00000019× /uni0000001b/uni00000011/uni00000017× /uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a× /uni00000014× /uni00000014× /uni00000014× /uni00000014× /uni00000014× /uni00000014× /uni00000014× /uni0000002a/uni00000033/uni00000038 /uni00000024 /uni00000015 /uni00000034 Figure 22: The energy efﬁciency compared with 2080Ti GPU on various tasks. than ﬁxed-point operations. As shown in Figure 21, the 32bit ﬂoat MUL T consumes 18.5x energy compared to the 8bit int MUL T . Therefore, our method’s energ y consumption is much lower than the FP32 model. T o illustrate the advantage of our approach in terms of energy efﬁciency, we compare our accelerator with the 2080Ti GPU on various tasks. T o estimate the energy e fﬁciency of GPU, we use the nvidia- smi to obtain the power of GPU when performing the inference and m easure the inference time by time function provided by Python. Then we can get the energy cost o f GPU. W e also model the energy cost of our method on the accelerator. W e use High Band width Memory (HBM) as our off- chip storage. Then we count the number of integer operations , and ﬂoating point operations, and the number of accesses to SRAM and HBM when performing the inf erence process of the quantized models on our accelerator. Based on the data in T able 21, we es timate the energy consumed by ﬁxed- point operations and ﬂoating-point operations. The static and dynamic power of SRAM is estimated using CACTI 7.0(Balasubramonian et al., 2017). The energy o f HBM 1.0 is estimated with 7 pJ/bit as in (O’Connor, 2014). Figure 22 presents these results, wh ich shows that the the energy efﬁciency of our method is signiﬁcantly better than GPU. A.8 C O M P L E X IT Y ANA LY S IS In this section, we provide the analysis of the complexity of our proposed A2Q method, including the computational complexity and space complexity. Space Complexity:When analyzing the space complexity, we use the data size of t he node features as an approximation of the entire loaded data, including wei ghts and features, because the node features account for more than 90% of the overall memory cons umption for a GNN model. For a GNN has L layers, we assume that the input data to the ﬁrst laye r is X ∈ RN×F0 , and the dimension of the hidden features is F1. Then the dimension of the input to the 2-(L-1) layer is N × F1. After quantizing the model, the average bits of the feature maps ar e bm. The memory size includes two parts: 1. the nodes features bm[NF0 + ( L − 1)NF1]. 2. the quantization step size (a step size is a ﬂoat-point number which is 32bit) for each node 32NL. Therefore, the space complexity of the overall GNN model is as follows: M = bm[NF0 + (L − 1)NF1] + 32 NL. (19) W e can also obtain the ratio of the memory consumption of the s tep size in overall memory size: r = 32NL bm[NF0 + (L − 1)NF1]. (20) In the node-level tasks, the F0 is usually much larger than 32, e.g., 3703 in the CiteSeer dat aset. Moreover, in the graph-level tasks, we usually set m = 1000 , which is much smaller than the number of the input nodes to models, i.e., N. Therefore, alth ough our method learns the quantization step size for each node the memory overhead introduced by the quantization step size is negligible. Computational Complexity: The forward pass is divided into the aggregation and update p hases according to the MPNN framework. The aggregation phase can b e represented as Hl = ˆAXl, 29Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 and then the update phase calculates Xl+1 = HlW l. For ˆA ∈ RN×N , Xl ∈ RN×F1 , and W l ∈ RF1×F2 , the computational complexity of the FP32 models is O(N2F1 + NF1F2), which are all the ﬂoat-point operations. After quantizing the mod el, the ﬂoat-point matrix multiplication can be replaced by integer multiplication, and the element- wise operation, which calculates the mul- tiplication between integers and ﬂoat-point numbers accor ding to the Eq. 2. Then the computational complexity is C = OI (N2F1 + NF1F2) + OE (NF2), (21) where OI represents the complexity of the integers multiplication, whose cost is much lower than the ﬂoat-point operations, and the OE represents the complexity of the element-wise operations. Note that although we quantize each node features by different st ep size, the complexity of element-wise operation involving ﬂoat-point is the same as the DQ-INT4 be cause the number of element-wise operations is equal to the number of the elements in a feature map, i.e., N × F2. 30",

The bitwidth used for features after ReLU activation is [b]+1. Weights (W) are quantized to a fixed 4-bit precision, but each column of W has its own learnable step size (βi). Matrix multiplications in the update phase are reformulated to use integer operations followed by element-wise scaling. For the aggregation phase (AX), X is quantized like W to allow integer operations. Quantization parameters are trained using backpropagation with a straight-through estimator. A memory penalty term (Lmemory) is added to the total loss (Ltotal = Ltask + λ · Lmemory) to promote higher compression. To overcome vanishing gradients in semi-supervised tasks due to sparse connections and few labeled nodes, a Local Gradient method is introduced, where quantization error (E = 1/d |xq − x|1) serves as supervision for node feature quantization parameters. For generalization to unseen graphs in graph-level tasks, the Nearest Neighbor Strategy is employed: 'm' groups of quantization parameters (s, b) are initialized, and for each node in an unseen graph, its maximum absolute feature value (fi) is used to find the nearest qmax (s(2[b]-1-1)) among the 'm' groups, assigning the corresponding (s, b) to that node. The gradients for these 'm' groups are collected and summed during backpropagation.",

ZINC is a regression task, others are classification. Baselines included FP32 models and DQ-INT4. Model weights were fixed to 4 bits for all GNNs, consistent with DQ-INT4. The average bitwidths for node features across all layers were reported. A custom precision-scalable hardware accelerator employing bit-serial multipliers was used to evaluate speedup, with a cycle-accurate simulator. The compression ratio was measured in terms of overall memory size compared to FP32.

Our source code is available at https: //github.com/qualcomm-ai-research/outlier-free-transformers . 1 Introduction Quantization has been one of the most impactful ways to reduce the computational complexity of transformer networks. Previous work has shown that quantizing networks to 4-bit weights is possible without losing too much accuracy [66, 69]. Some research even shows 4-bit weights might be optimal when trading off model size and bit-width [12]. However, quantizing transformers is not always trivial. When quantizing the activations of a trans- former, significant problems arise with outliers in specific layers. This has been noted by several researchers that suggest fixes to transformers after training to ameliorate their effect [13, 67]. These methods are frequently tedious and either require retraining the network, require implementing specific hardware for input-channel quantization [13] or require parts of the activations to still be in higher bit-widths, reducing the effectiveness of the activation quantization [67]. In this paper, we set out to solve the transformer outlier problem entirely by changing the architecture of the network itself. We hope to make transformers easy to quantize from the get-go without needing ∗Qualcomm AI Research is an initiative of Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023). arXiv:2306.12929v2  [cs.LG]  9 Nov 2023any post-processing. To do so, we thoroughly analyze why these outliers appear. Previous work has found the existence of these outliers [4, 13], but in our work, we come to a fuller understanding of these outlying values. We find that the outliers occur because attention heads are trying not to update the hidden state, and in the process, strong outliers appear due to the softmax function. This happens for language and vision transformers and different specific transformer architectures. This understanding is the foundation for two new tweaks we suggest to transformer architectures that can remove the problem of the outliers entirely. 2 Background and related work In this section, we briefly cover the basics of neural network quantization and discuss why modern transformers are difficult to quantize. Quantization One of the most powerful ways to decrease the computational time and memory consumption of neural networks is quantization, which uses low-bit representations for the weights and activation tensors. On top of that, using low-bit fixed-point representations, such as INT8, one can further reduce energy consumption since the fixed-point operations are more efficient than their floating-point counterparts [23, 59]. We simulate the quantization process in floating-point according to Jacob et al. [26]. We use the following definition of the quantization function: bx := q (x; s, z, b) =s · \u0010 clip \u0010jx s m + z; 0, 2b − 1 \u0011 − z \u0011 , (1) where x denotes the quantizer input (i.e., network weights or activations), s ∈ R+ the scale factor or the step-size, z ∈ Z the zero point, and b ∈ N the bitwidth. ⌊·⌉ denotes the round-to-nearest-integer operator. This quantization scheme is called uniform affine or asymmetric quantization [24, 32, 76] and it is one of the most commonly used quantization schemes because it allows for efficient implementation of fixed-point arithmetic. In the case of symmetric quantization, we restrict the quantization grid to be symmetric around z = 0. In this work, we focus on post-training quantization (PTQ) methods, which take a pre-trained FP32 network and convert it directly into a fixed-point network without the need for the original training pipeline [2, 5, 7, 25, 32, 35, 41, 43, 44, 75]. These methods require either no data or only a small calibration dataset and are easier to use compared to quantization-aware training (QAT, Bhalgat et al. 3, Esser et al. 16, Gupta et al. 21, Jacob et al. 26, Krishnamoorthi 32) methods that have you train the entire network for more epochs. For more details on neural network quantization, we refer the reader to [19, 46]. Outliers in Transformers Multiple studies have shown that modern transformer-based language models tend to learn outliers in weights and activations [4, 13, 31]. These outliers are present only in a small fixed set of embedding dimensions, but they appear regularly and consistently across multiple layers and data sequences. It was also shown that those outliers play a crucial role in the model predictions and clipping them or by setting to zero the corresponding parameters significantly degrades the model task performance [31, 49]. The strongest in magnitude outliers typically appear at the output of the feed-forward network, FFN, although Dettmers et al.[13] showed that for big enough transformer-based language models they start appearing after every linear layer, including query, key, and value projection layers. This phenomenon holds for many tasks, training objectives and models (both encoder and decoder transformers), including BERT [14], RoBERTa [37], DistilBERT [53], MobileBERT [55], ELECTRA [9], BART [33], XLNet [68], GPT-2 [50], and OPT [74]. Because of these strong outliers, applying per-tensor PTQ for the FFN’s output and the residual sum will likely cause a notable error because of the following trade-off between the range and the precision. On the one hand, using a large quantization range for small-ranged values leads to a loss in representation (high rounding error). On the other hand, a small quantization range for large values leads to a very high clipping error. For the case of significant transformer outliers, frequently, no good trade-off can be found between the rounding and clipping error, resulting in an overall high error. There have been numerous attempts to fix the issue of transformer quantization [4, 12, 13, 17, 27, 28, 51, 54, 62, 63, 69, 71]. Most of these approaches resort to finer quantization granularity (row-wise, 2(a) FFN output in layer #10  (b) FFN output in layer #11 Figure 1: Histograms of outlier counts vs. token positions (blue) and hidden dimensions (green), recorded from the MNLI-m validation set on BERT-base. We use zero-based indexing for dimensions. channel-wise, group-wise weight and activation quantization), use higher bitwidth and/or different numeric format to represent those outliers better or require extra fine-tuning (in the form of QAT and/or knowledge distillation). In other words, they adapt quantization to work with outliers, which often comes at the expense of general applicability or extra inference overhead. In contrast, in this work, we want to address the root cause of the problem and understand why outliers are learned in the first place and suggest a new pre-training protocol that significantly reduces the magnitude of outliers yielding way more quantization-friendly models that can be effortlessly quantized using PTQ without strong degradation of performance. 3 Outlier analysis Outliers in BERT models In Section 2 we discussed that outliers are present only in a few designated embedding dimensions but they appear regularly and consistently across multiple layers and data sequences. We also discussed that the strongest magnitude outliers in BERT typically appear at the output of FFN in the last encoder layers. We start by taking the pre-trained BERT-base-uncased checkpoint from HuggingFace [65] and fine- tune it on MNLI dataset from the well-known GLUE benchmark [ 61] (see experimental details in C.1). To identify the outlier dimensions, we pass the MNLI-m validation set through the network and record all outliers1 at the FFN output in layers #10 and #112. As we can see in Figure 1, there are indeed only a few hidden dimensions where outliers ever occur. We also notice that the majority of outliers (> 97%) correlate with the position of delimiter tokens – [SEP], “.”, and “,”. To better understand the role of those outliers, we analyze the attention patterns of the corresponding attention heads. BERT-base uses multi-head attention with nheads = 12and each head operating on a consecutive subset of dhead = 64features. Therefore, the hidden dimension #180, which happens to have the highest outlier count in both layers #10 and #11, corresponds to attention head #3. In Figure 2 (and more examples in Appendix A.1) we show examples of the attention matrices, values and their product for that head. A common pattern we found is that the attention head assigns almost all of its probability mass to [SEP] tokens, and other less informative tokens like dots/commas, while these tokens also have small values in V associated with those tokens. This results in a small magnitude product between the two (see Figure 2a). This effectively corresponds to a (soft) no-update of the hidden representation, where only small noise is added after the residual. In other cases (Figure 2b and 2c), we observe that a significant portion of attention probability is still spent on delimiter tokens. However, by allocating some of the probability mass on other tokens (together with the small values for the delimiter tokens), this results in a (soft) selective update of the hidden representation. These patterns in self-attention seem to be a learned “workaround” for the limitations of having the softmax and the residual connections in cases where the attention head does not want to update the representation of some or all of the tokens. These observations are in line with Clark et al. [8], Kovaleva et al. [30] that also argued that attending exclusively or almost exclusively to delimiter tokens such as [SEP], periods/commas acts as a “no-op” when the attention head’s function is not applicable. 1We follow Bondarenko et al. [4] and consider outliers as values that exceed 6 standard deviations from the mean of the corresponding activation tensor. 2We use 1-based indexing for encoder layers and attention heads throughout the paper. 3(a) Attention layer #11, data sequence #1 (b) Attention layer #11, data sequence #5 (c) Attention layer #10, data sequence #5 Figure 2: Visualization of the patterns in the self-attention, specifically the attention probabilities, values, and their product (left, middle and right columns, respectively), in attention head #3 for BERT-base, computed on several data sequences from MNLI-m validation set.

(e) An average magnitude of values for outlier and non-outlier patches. Outliers in ViT We conduct a similar analysis for Vision transformer [15] trained on ImageNet [52]. For this study, we use a pre-trained checkpoint following our experimental setup from Section 5. We highlight our findings in Figure 3 and provide more examples in Appendix A.2. Our analysis shows many similarities to the BERT case. Instead of delimiter tokens, the majority of outliers seem to correlate with some random uninformative patches (e.g., in the background). We also see that the corresponding attention head in the next layer allocates the majority of attention probabilities to the same patches. Finally, those outlier patches on average have a distinctly smaller magnitude of values compared to non-outlier ones, leading to similar no-update behavior. The fact that those values are not as close to zero as it was in the BERT case might be related to the smaller model capacity3, or a relatively shorter training procedure. Hypothesis Based on these observations, we pose the following hypothesis on how this behavior of attention heads is related to outliers: 1. In order for an attention block to not update a representation of a token on the residual, some attention heads want to allocate most of their attention probability mass to some fixed and common set of tokens that have a low information content (e.g., delimiter tokens or background patches) that can be learned to have a small value function output. 3We use ViT/S-16 configuration that has only 22M parameters. 42. From the definition of the softmax function4, it is easy to see that this would require an input of the softmax to have a relatively big dynamic range (Figure 4, 1 ). In fact, in the limit case where softmax is exactly zero, this would require an infinite dynamic range: softmax (x)i = 0 ⇔ ∃ j ̸= i, xj − xi = +∞ (2) 3. Since Layer Normalization ([1], 2 ) normalizes the outliers, the magnitude of the FFN output in the previous layer ( 3 ) has to be very high to still produce a sufficiently big dynamic range after the LayerNorm. Note, that this is also applicable for the transformer models with LayerNorm applied prior to the self-attention or linear transformations instead, a variant adopted by GPT, OPT, and many vision transformers [15, 38, 57, 58]. 4. Finally, as softmax will never output exact zeros, it will always back-propagate a gradient signal to grow bigger outliers5. The outliers will thus tend to become stronger in magnitude, the longer the network is trained. 4 Method Figure 4: A schematic illus- tration of the attention layer in BERT. Hidden activation tensor is denoted by x. ⊕ is an element-wise addition. A problematic output of the FFN that generates largest in magni- tude outliers is highlighted in red. Notice how those outliers in the previous layer influence the behavior in the attention mechanism in the next layer. In this section, we introduce our proposed modifications for the softmax attention mechanism. Based on our insights from Section 3, the core idea of these modifications is to grant the model the ability to produce very small the magnitude (or even exact zeros) output of attention function, without producing outliers. Recall that the self-attention [60] is defined as follows: Attention(x) := softmax \u0012Q(x)K(x)T √dhead \u0013 V (x) (3) where Q, K and V are learnable linear projections of the input x. Most modern transformer models employ a multi-headed variant of self-attention, where dmodel features are partitioned into nheads groups of dhead features, and the final output is the concatenation of the outputs of (3) applied to each group. 4.1 Clipped softmax First, we propose to replace softmax function in (3) with the follow- ing clipped softmax: clipped_softmax(x; ζ, γ) := clip ((ζ − γ) · softmax(x) +γ, 0, 1) . (4) Here x is the input and ζ ≥ 1, γ ≤ 0 are the stretch factors which are hyper-parameters of the method. Similar formulation was used before for sigmoid function [40, 45]. We can view (4) as stretching the output of the softmax from(0, 1) to (γ, ζ) and then clipping back to (0, 1) so that we can represent exact zeros if γ <0 and exact ones if ζ > 1. Specifically, the values of the softmax larger than 1−γ ζ−γ are rounded to one whereas values smaller than −γ ζ−γ are rounded to zero. With this drop-in replacement, we can achieve exact zeros (and ones) with a finite range for the softmax input. In addition to that, whenever values are clipped they will not give a gradient, preventing the outliers to grow further. 4softmax (x)i = exp (xi) / Pd j=1 exp (xj) 5Let y = softmax (x). Then ∂yi ∂xj ̸= 0∀i, j. 54.2 Gated attention An alternative way of architecting the model to have a small attention output without outliers is to equip it with an explicit conditional gating mechanism, as shown in Figure 5. The idea is that the model can use the gating to either keep or nullify the update to the representation of certain tokens and not rely on the attention probabilities and values to achieve the same outcome. Specifically, we propose the following modification to the attention function: Gated_attention(x) := sigmoid (G(x)) ⊙ softmax \u0012Q(x)K(x)T √dhead \u0013 V (x). (5) Here G is the gating function,⊙ is an element-wise multiplication across the token axis and everything else remains the same as in (3). The gating function G is parameterized by a small neural network that is learned jointly with the rest of the model. We replace the attention formulation with the proposed variant in every layer on the transformer network. Figure 5: A schematic il- lustration of our proposed gated attention. Gating module design Recall that the input to the attention layer x has shape (T, dmodel) that is reshaped into (nheads, T, dhead) for the multi-headed self-attention, where T is the sequence length. We chose to define the gating function on a per-head basis. For each head i ∈ {1, . . . , nheads}, we specify Gi : Rdhead → R and the output of the gating module is πi ∈ RT that is computed as follows: bπi,t = Gi(xi,t,:) ∀t ∈ {1, . . . , T} (6) πi,: = sigmoid(bπi,:), (7) note that gating modules are shared between different token positions but not shared across attention heads. We want our gating module to be as lightweight as possible. To start with, we experiment with Gi’s parameterized by a single linear layer. This gives us a gating module that is computationally inexpensive and has a memory overhead of just nheads · (dhead + 1)∼ dmodel extra parameters (which is equivalent to 1 extra token) per attention layer6. We also investigate the effect of using several other gating functions in Appendix B.1. 5 Experiments In this section, we evaluate the proposed modifications to self-attention on several language models (BERT, OPT) and the vision transformers (ViT). We first test the different hyperparameters for the methods and provide insight into how they work. Then we set out to test our method in terms of accuracy, and the difference in quantization improvement after training. All detailed hyperparameters of our experiments are in Appendix C. BERT We experiment with BERT-base-uncased (109M parameters) pre-training using the masked language modeling (MLM) objective. Following [ 14], we use the concatenation of the training sets of BookCorpus [77] and English Wikipedia7. We implement our methods in PyTorch [48] and use training and evaluation pipelines from HuggingFace libraries [ 20, 34, 65]. We follow closely the pre-training procedure from [ 14]. To speed up training and experimentation, we train with a maximum sequence length of 128 for the whole duration of the training. We evaluate on Wikipedia validation set and report the MLM perplexity. OPT We experiment with a 125M sized variant of OPT [74] pre-training using the causal language modeling (CLM) objective. Due to compute constraints, we train the model on the same dataset that was used for BERT pre-training (BookCorpus + Wikipedia) with a maximum sequence length of 512 6For instance, in case of BERT-base, this amounts to less than 0.009% of the total model size. 7Specifically, we use the English subset of Wiki-40b,https://huggingface.co/datasets/wiki40b, that contains cleaned-up text of English Wikipedia and training/validation splits. 6γ ζ FP16 ppl.↓ Max inf. norm Avg. kurtosis W8A8 ppl. ↓ 0 1 4.49±0.01 735±55 3076±262 1294±1046 (= Vanilla) 0 1 .003 4.48±0.01 715±335 2159±238 451±57 0 1 .03 4.49±0.00 741±66 1707±1249 1469±646 −0.003 1 4.46±0.00 688±64 2149±110 636±566 −0.03 1 4.41±0.01 20±1 80±6 4.55±0.01 −0.003 1 .003 4.47±0.00 683±23 2494±1205 268±120 −0.03 1 .03 4.43±0.03 22±3 73±8 4.56±0.05 Table 1: The impact of clipped softmax hyperparameters on BERT-base. and batch size of 192. Similar to our BERT experiments, we use training and evaluation pipelines from HuggingFace libraries. We evaluate on Wikipedia validation set and report the CLM perplexity. ViT Finally, we explore the effectiveness of proposed techniques on vision transformer [15] (ViT- S/16 configuration, 22M parameters) trained on ImageNet-1K [11, 52]. For these experiments, we adopt the training and validation pipelines from PyTorch Image models library [64]. We report top-1 accuracy on the validation set of ImageNet. Quantization setup In all experiments, after the model is trained, we apply 8-bit PTQ. We use uniform affine quantization – symmetric weights, asymmetric activations – with the static activation range setting, as discussed in Section 2. We quantize all weights and activations (both input and output), except the final linear layer for BERT and OPT models. We explore several choices of range estimation (see Appendix C.4) and report the best configuration for each experiment, based on the model performance. We repeat each PTQ experiment 3 times with different random seeds8 and report mean and standard deviation for accuracy/perplexity. We train each network two times with different random seeds and report mean and standard deviation. To assess the amount of outliers in the trained model, we use two metrics: the maximum ∥x∥∞ averaged across the validation set, and kurtosis of x averaged across all layers, where x is the output of an attention layer. These metrics have been shown to correlate well with the model quantizability [4, 6]. 5.1 The impact of clipped softmax hyperparameters (γ and ζ) We investigate the effect of different values of the clipped softmax stretch parameters and present the results in Table 1. We can see that most of the improvement happens when we use γ < 0 (clipping at zero). For instance, using the value of γ = −0.03 leads to a significantly smaller infinity norm, kurtosis, and quantized model perplexity, compared to the baseline. It is also clear that in the limit |γ| →0 we approach the vanilla softmax attention. Using ζ >1 (clipping at one) yields similar results to the vanilla softmax. Finally, when we combine both γ <0 and ζ >1, for which the results seem similar to just clipping at 0. We, therefore, conclude that for dampening outliers, only the lower-range clipping allows exact zeros matter. Going forward we use only γ <0 and in Appendix B.5 we confirm that ζ >1 is not required for ViT. These observations are in line with our hypothesis that by giving the model the mechanism for representing exact zeros in the attention, we don’t need to learn the strong outliers. 5.2 Clipped softmax γ vs. sequence length As having an extra hyper-parameter that needs to be tuned per model or setup is generally not desirable, we study the sensitivity of the stretch factor γ and its relation with the sequence length T. Recall that the matrix of attention probabilities P has dimensions T × T and each row sums up to one. Because of that, the average value in P is 1/T. It is reasonable to assume that if we define 8Different random subsets of training data are used for quantizer range estimation. 7(a) Relative FP16 log-perplexity  (b) Maximum infinity norm Figure 6: The performance of clipped softmax using γ = −α/T parameterization on BERT-6L.

To study this, we train a 6-layer variant of BERT-base (BERT-6L) for 500000 steps on WikiText- 103 [ 42] with a batch size of 128 with several values of maximum sequence lengths T ∈ {32, 64, 128, 192, 256} and values of α ∈ {1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 8}. As we can see from Figure 6, using a clipped softmax with α ∈ [2, 4] significantly dampens the magnitude of outliers while maintaining good FP16 perplexity across all explored sequence lengths. 5.3 The impact of bias initialization in gated attention In all our gated attention experiments, we randomly initialize the weights of G, following [22]. By initializing the bias to a specific value, however, we can set gates to be more open or more closed initially. More open at the start means we initialize closer to the original network, but given the exponential nature of the gate it might take many iterations for the gate to learn to close. Similarly, if the gates are all closed at the start, we deviate too far from the original model training, causing a potential decrease in performance. Assuming Linear Gi’s with small initial weights, if we set the bias to the value of binit, then Gi(·) ≈ binit and πi(·) = sigmoid(Gi(·)) ≈ sigmoid(binit) =:πinit, at the start of training. We study the effect of different values of binit for Linear gated attention on BERT-6L and ViT. We set the bias for all Gi’s to the same value of binit. For BERT-6L, we use the same setup as in Section 5.2, with a fixed sequence length of 128. For ViT, we use the main setup, except we train it for 150 epochs instead of 300. In Figure 7 we see in both BERT and ViT cases that using bias with very highπinit generally performs similarly to the vanilla attention (comparable floating-point performance but strong outliers and poor quantized performance) while setting bias to have very low πinit dampens outliers quite well but leads to strong degradation in the floating-point and quantized performance. The reasonable ranges of πinit seems to be around [0.25, 0.9] for BERT and [0.1, 0.5] for ViT. The wide range indicates the relative robustness of our method to this hyperparameter. 8Model Method FP16/32 Max inf. norm Avg. kurtosis W8A8 BERT (ppl.↓) Vanilla 4.49 ±0.01 735±55 3076±262 1294±1046 Clipped softmax 4.39±0.00 21.5±1.5 80±6 4.52±0.01 Gated attention 4.45 ±0.03 39.2±26.0 201±181 4.65±0.04 OPT (ppl.↓) Vanilla 15.84 ±0.05 340±47 1778±444 21.18±1.89 Clipped softmax 16.29 ±0.07 63.2±8.8 19728±7480 37.20±2.40 Gated attention 15.55±0.05 8.7±0.6 18.9±0.9 16.02±0.07 ViT (acc.↑) Vanilla 80.75 ±0.10 359±81 1018±471 69.24±6.93 Clipped softmax 80.89 ±0.13 73.7±14.9 22.9±1.6 79.77±0.25 Gated attention 81.01±0.06 79.8±0.5 19.9±0.3 79.82±0.11 Table 2: A summary of results for our proposed methods applied on BERT, OPT-125m, and ViT.

As we can see, in almost all cases, both of our proposed techniques dampen the outliers’ magnitude to a great extent, reduce the kurtosis, and yield models with significantly higher quantized performance, which is close to the original FP16/32 performance. In addition to that, for each model, at least one of our methods also improves the floating-point task performance. We hypothesize this is because the network is helped with learning the “no-op” updates more easily. However, we are cautious about the improved performance as this is not consistent across all hyper-parameters and it is unclear if it generalizes to more architectures and larger models. The only case where our method failed to perform well was the clipped softmax applied to OPT. At the moment, we do not have an explanation of why this is the case and leave it for future work. We list selected hyper-parameters and show extended results in Appendix B. We also show the results of our proposed methods quantized to lower bitwidths in Appendix B.7. Results for bigger modelsWe study the question of scalability of our methods to larger models. In Table 3 we show the gated attention results for 350m and 1.3B variants of OPT. Due to compute constraints, we trained networks for 105 steps with batch size of 256 and the rest is the same as in our main pre-training setup. As we can see, our proposed gated attention is also very effective at dampening the outliers and significantly improving the quantized model performance when applied to bigger models. We further study in Appendix B.6 how gated attention can decrease outliers when fine-tuning bigger pre-trained models with outliers. 5.5 Qualitative results In Figure 8 we compare the learned attention patterns using vanilla softmax and our proposed methods (more examples in Appendix A.1). As we can see, both methods can represent a partial/soft no-op behavior, but in case of our methods this does not require strong outliers elsewhere in the network. Note that we found similar patterns in multiple attention heads, but the exact head indices where we observed such patterns depend on random initialization. In the case of clipped softmax, smaller attention weights are generally more diffused while higher weights are more saturated (which comes from the stretching and clipping). In the case of gated attention, the output of the softmax is significantly different since the update of the hidden representation is now further modulated by gating probabilities. 9(a) Vanilla softmax (Attention layer #11, head #3) (b) Clipped softmax (Attention layer #11, head #8) (c) Gated attention (Attention layer #11, head #5) Figure 8: Visualization of the self-attention patterns for BERT-base trained using vanilla and our proposed techniques, computed on data sequence #5 from MNLI-m validation set.

We also see that despite the network trying to learn a full “no-op”, still a small amount of noise is added to each residual, which may constitute a form of network regularization. Investigating this further might give us a clue as to why neural networks generalize despite being significantly overparametrized if many parameters are rendered unused by not updating the representation in later layers [72]. Limitations While we studied the scalability of our method for models up to 1.3B size, we haven’t explored the case of very large transformers that are trained for way longer. Given the fundamental understanding of the issue underlying our solutions, we expect the same effect on larger-scale models. We show a very small improvement in FP16/FP32 performance due to our methods, but we do not deem our results exhaustive enough to claim that this will hold in general. Lastly, our methods do have a hyperparameter each, although we show that both methods are relatively robust to its hyperparameter, having one is never optimal. Impact As our methods help transformers to be more efficient, we expect only positive outcomes of our work. Making neural networks more efficient will help with their high power consumption at inference. It further helps to move inference from the cloud to edge devices which can overcome potential privacy concerns. We cannot fathom any negative impact from our work that is not severely construed. 7 Conclusions We have thoroughly analyzed the activation outlier problem that makes transformers difficult to quantize. We showed that transformer networks try to learn not to update residuals and that by doing so, through the combination of the softmax, residual connections and LayerNorm, significant outliers appear in transformers. Based on this insight, we proposed two methods to address this at the core – clipped softmax and gated attention. These structural changes to transformers give similar, if not better, floating-point performance after training but significantly improve the post-training quantization results. We hope that with these two architectural changes to transformers, anyone can train high-performance transformers that are easy to quantize and can benefit from efficient integer inference. 10References [1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

(a)  (b)  (c) Figure 9: A summary of several outlier statistics recorded from ImageNet validation set on ViT. (a) Average infinity norm of the output of each attention layer. (b) A histogram of outlier counts in attention layer #10 vs. hidden dimensions. We use zero-based indexing for dimensions. (c) A heatmap of outlier counts in attention layer #10 vs. patch positions. A.1 BERT Recall from Figure 1 that all the outliers are only present in hidden dimensions #123, #180, #225, #308, #381, #526, #720 (with the majority of them in #180, #720). These hidden dimensions correspond to attention heads #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #9, and #12. In Figures 10 and 11 we show more examples of the discovered self-attention patterns for attention heads #3 and #12 (↔ hidden dim #180 and #720, respectively). We also show self-attention patterns in attention heads and layers which are not associated with the outliers in Figures 12 and 13, respectively. Finally, in Figures 14 and 15 we show more examples of the attention patterns learned in the network trained with clipped softmax and gated attention. A.2 ViT Figure 9 further shows that there are a lot of similarities in the outlier behavior in the vision transformer, compared to BERT. The strongest magnitude outliers generally happen in the later layers, peaking at layers #10 and #11. The majority of outliers (> 99%) are only ever happening in only 10 hidden dimensions, primarily in dimensions #48 and #43, which corresponds to the attention head #1. Finally, averaged across the entire ImageNet validation set, the outliers seem to be concentrated at the boundaries of the image, which suggest a strong correlation with the background (and a negative correlation with the object, which is usually in the center of the image in the ImageNet dataset). In Figures 16 and 17, we show more examples of outlier and self-attention patterns in the attention head #1 (↔ hidden dimensions #48, #43) for a random subset of images from the ImageNet validation set (in layers #10 and #11, respecively). B Detailed results In this section, we provide extended results for each model, including the used hyperparameters and other design choices. We also present some additional ablation studies. 16Configuration G Memory overhead (per attention layer) # extra parameters # extra tokens Linear nheads × Linear(dhead → 1) nheads(dhead + 1) ∼ 1 MLP nheads × MLP(dhead → nhid → 1) nheads(nhid(dhead + 2) + 1) ∼ nhid All-heads-linear Linear(dmodel → nheads) nheads(dmodel + 1) ∼ nheads Table 4: An overview of the gating function parameterizations explored in this paper and their memory overhead. B.1 Gating architectures We investigate the choice of several gating functions, summarized in Table 4. The configuration “MLP” parameterizes each Gi with a feed-forward net with one hidden layer of size nhid and a ReLU non-linearity [47]. We also explore what happens if we allow the mixing of the representation from different attention heads in the “All-heads-linear” setting, where we use a single linear layer to produce the gating probabilities for all attention heads at once. All three options are tested below. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, we initialize the bias of the gating function to zero (i.e., binit = 0 ↔ πinit = 0.5).

We report the masked language modeling perplexity (ppl. for short) on the English Wikipedia validation set for both the floating-point baseline and W8A8 quantized model. We also report the maximum ∥x∥∞ averaged across the validation set, and kurtosis of x averaged across all layers, where x is the output of an attention layer. Detailed results for BERT-base are summarized in Table 5. As we can see, across most of the settings, both of our methods significantly dampen the outliers’ magnitude, reduce the kurtosis, drastically improve the quantized performance, while maintaining and sometimes improving the FP16 perplexity. B.3 OPT Detailed results for OPT-125m are summarized in Table 6. In our early experiments on a smaller OPT model, we found that applying the weight decay on LayerNorm weights γ (which isn’t the case, by default) has a strong effect on reducing the outliers’ magnitude while yielding the comparable FP16 performance.

Detailed results for ViT-S/16 are summarized in Table 7. After our preliminary experiments on ViT, we noticed that distinct outliers already originate after the patch embeddings. Therefore, we experimented with adding the LayerNorm after the patch 18embeddings (which was absent in the model definition, by default). As we can see in Table 6, together with this change, both of our proposed methods greatly dampens the outliers’ magnitude, reduces the kurtosis, and yields models with significantly higher quantized performance, which is within 1% of the original FP32 accuracy.

We investigate the effect of different values of the clipped softmax stretch parameters applied to the vision transformer and present the results in Table 8. To speed up training, for this experiment we trained ViT for 150 epochs instead of the usual 300 epochs. For this experiment, we did not apply LayerNorm after the patch embeddings. We found similar observations compared to BERT. Specifically, most of the improvement happens when we use γ <0 (clipping at zero) whereas using ζ >1 (clipping at one) yields similar results to the vanilla softmax and combining both γ <0 and ζ >1 yields similar results compared to just clipping at zero.

We report the causal language modeling perplexity (ppl. for short) on the English Wikipedia validation set. We also report the maximum ∥x∥∞ averaged across the validation set, and kurtosis of x averaged across all layers, where x is the output of an attention layer. One of the drawbacks of our proposed framework is that it requires training from scratch, which could be expensive when applied to very large models. To address this, we explored whetherfine-tuning using gated attention can still lead to improved performance and decreased outliers for larger models. We used OPT-1.3B pre-trained checkpoint from HuggingFace and fine-tuned it on Bookcorpus + Wikipedia for 4000 steps with batch size 256, maximum sequence length 512, maximum learning rate 10−5, and linear LR schedule with 400 warmup steps. We use the same LR for both model parameters and gating module parameters. The rest of hyper-parameters are the same as for our pre-training setup. We adapted our gating approach as follows. We initialized bias as binit = 0, which corresponds to the expected initial gating probability output of πinit = 0.5. We multiply the gating probability by 2 so that the expected gate output is 1 and we approximate the attention output of 19the vanilla softmax at the start of fine-tuning. We add a small activation regularization term at the output of each FFN to further encourage the reduction in the magnitude of activations, as unlike when training from scratch outliers are already present in the pre-trained model and need to be suppressed. As we can see from Table 9, fine-tuning with our proposed gated attention results in a better perplexity and also reduced maximum infinity norm and the average kurtosis compared to fine-tuning with vanilla softmax.

We report the masked language modeling perplexity on the English Wikipedia validation set. Note that our proposed methods are not limited to 8-bit quantization only and in general can be combined with other more advanced quantization and weight compression methods, including [18, 35, 36, 45, 63, 67]. In Table 10, we show the results of our proposed methods applied to BERT-base and quantized to different bitwidths using our simple post-training quantization setup. Unless stated otherwise, for low-bit (<8-bit) weights and activations we use MSE range estimator as recommended by [2, 7] since it gives better results. As we can see, in all cases both of our methods significantly improve the perplexity compared to the vanilla softmax pre-training. We also notice that generally the performance progressively degrades as we decrease the bitwidths, which is to be expected. Achieving good results with low-bit activation quantization in general is a challenging problem. Further, we notice that the perplexity of the vanilla model significantly improves whenever we consider a low-bit weight quantization with MSE ranges compared to the INT8 case. This can be explained by the fact that using MSE range estimation for weights leads to an implicit clipping of activations (in the same and all subsequent layers in the network), which happen to be of the right amount so that it doesn’t hurt the perplexity. We found that by going from W8A8 to W6A8 the average kurtosis is reduced from 3406±547 to 631±94 and the maximum infinity norm is reduced from 577±80 to 158±40. However, in all cases the resulting model still has significantly larger outliers and a worse performance than both of our proposed methods. Finally, as said before, if achieving good low-bit quantization performance is the goal, it is recommended to combine our methods with more advanced quantization techniques. C Experimental details C.1 BERT Fine-tuning on MNLI dataset We use pre-trained checkpoint BERT-base-uncased (109M param- eters) from HuggingFace repository. We follow standard fine-tuning practices from [14] and [ 65] Each data sequence is tokenized and truncated to the maximum sequence length of 128. Shorter sequences are padded to the same length of 128 using a special [PAD] token. We fine-tune for 3 epochs using Adam [29] with a batch size of 16 and no weight decay. The learning rate is initially set to its maximum value of of 2 · 10−5 and is linearly decayed to zero by the end of fine-tuning. Pre-training from scratch We follow closely the pre-training procedure from [14]. We concate- nate, tokenize, and split the training set into sequences of length 128 (to speed up training and experimentation, we do not fine-tune on longer sequences of 512). We use the masked language modeling objective with the probability of masking p = 0.15. We train with a batch size of 256 20sequences for 106 steps, using AdamW optimizer [ 39] with the maximum learning rate of 10−4, learning rate warm up over the first 104 steps, following by a linear decay to zero by the end of training. We use L2 weight decay of 0.01, L2 gradient norm clipping of 1.0, and dropout probability of 0.1 on all layers. We also use FP16 mixed-precision from HuggingFace Accelerate library [20]. C.2 OPT pre-training To speed up experimentation, we train OPT-125m sized model on the concatenation of Wikipedia and BookCorpus (same as BERT pre-training). We train with a batch size of 48 and 4 gradient accumulation steps (which results in the effective batch size of 192), so that we can perform pre- training on a single A100 80GB GPU. We concatenate, tokenize, and split the training set into sequences of length 512 and train for 125000 steps (500000 forward passes). We use the rest of the hyper-parameters and follow pre-training practices from [74] and [65]. We initialize weights using a normal distribution with zero mean and a standard deviation of 0.006. All bias terms are initialized to zero. We use AdamW optimizer with (β1, β2) = (0.9, 0.95). We use the linear learning rate schedule, warming up from 0 to the maximum value† of 4 · 10−4 over the first 2000 steps, following by a linear decay to zero by the end of training. We use L2 weight decay of 0.1, L2 gradient norm clipping of 1.0, and dropout probability of 0.1 on all layers. We also use FP16 mixed-precision from HuggingFace Accelerate library [20]. Note that in our experiments for all model sizes we use the consistent LayerNorm placement before the attention block, unlike OPT-350m checkpoint from HuggingFace that places LayerNorm after the attention block. C.3 ViT pre-training We use the model definition for ViT-S/16 and the training pipeline from PyTorch Image models library [64]. All training is done on resolution 224 ×224 and 16 ×16 patches. For data augmentation, we use RandAugment [10], Mixup [73], CutMix [70], random image cropping [56], horizontal flip, label smoothing ε = 0.1, color jitter 0.4, and random (between bilinear and bicubic) interpolation during training. We train with a batch size of 512 for 300 epochs, using AdamW optimizer and the L2 weight decay of 0.03. We use the cosine learning rate schedule, warming up from 10−6 to the maximum value of 10−3 over the first 20 epochs, followed by a LR decay by a factor of 10 every 30 epochs, until it reaches the minimum value of 10−5. C.4 Quantization settings Weights In all cases, we use symmetric uniform quantization of weights. We use min-max weight quantization for all models except the OPT model, for which we found the MSE estimator to perform better in all cases. Activations We adopt static range estimation approach, which determines quantization parameters for the network by passing a few batches of calibration data through the model before inference. Specifically, we use a running min-max estimator [32], which uses an exponential moving average of the min and max over multiple batches. In all cases, we use running min-max with 0.9 momentum over 16 batches randomly sampled from respective training sets. For OPT model, we also experiment with using 99.99% and 99.999% percentiles instead of actual min and max. We select the best configuration for each experiment (including baseline), based on the model performance. In almost all cases, we found that setting activation quantization ranges using 99.999% percentiles gives the lowest W8A8 perplexity. D Compute cost We compare the runtime of our proposed methods in Table 11. As we can see, the clipped softmax is only marginally more expensive compared to using the vanilla softmax attention. The gated attention †In our experiments, we found this value to perform better compared to the value of 6 · 10−4 listed in the paper. 21Model Vanilla Clipped softmax Gated attention (Linear / MLP) BERT 92.8 ±1.2 93.6±0.8 97.7 / 119.1 OPT 53.6 ±0.4 54.4±0.4 55.7 / 64.7 ViT 101.8 ±0.3 104.0±0.7 110.8 / 122.9 Table 11: An overview of the runtime of the proposed methods, compared to the vanilla pre-training, measured in hours on Nvidia-A100 GPUs. using the linear G adds the compute overhead between 3% and 8%, depending on the model.

        "main_contributions": "The paper addresses the significant problem of strong outliers in transformer model activations, which makes low-bitwidth quantization challenging and leads to performance degradation. It identifies the root cause of these outliers: attention heads attempting a \"no-op\" or partial residual update by pushing softmax inputs to extreme values during training, especially when attending to uninformative tokens. To solve this, the authors propose two independent architectural modifications: Clipped Softmax, which allows exact zeros and ones in the attention matrix with finite input ranges and prevents outlier growth; and Gated Attention, which introduces an explicit conditional gating mechanism to control updates. These methods are shown to significantly reduce outlier magnitudes, maintain or improve floating-point task performance, and enable full INT8 activation quantization without additional effort, across various language (BERT, OPT) and vision (ViT) transformers.",
        "methodology": "The research focuses on post-training quantization (PTQ) using uniform affine quantization (symmetric weights, asymmetric activations, primarily INT8 for activations). The core methodology involves a detailed outlier analysis in BERT and ViT models, revealing a pattern where attention heads attempt \"no-op\" behavior by concentrating probability mass on low-information tokens. This requires large dynamic ranges for softmax inputs, which, when normalized by LayerNorm, leads to very high FFN outputs, propagating outliers. The proposed solutions are: 1. Clipped Softmax: Replaces the standard softmax with `clipped_softmax(x; ζ, γ) := clip ((ζ − γ) · softmax(x) +γ, 0, 1)`, which stretches and clips softmax outputs, allowing exact zeros (with γ < 0) and ones (with ζ > 1) with finite input ranges and halting gradient flow for clipped values. 2. Gated Attention: Modifies the attention function to `Gated_attention(x) := sigmoid (G(x)) ⊙ softmax (Q(x)K(x)T/√dhead) V (x)`, introducing a learnable gating function G (a lightweight neural network, often a linear layer per head) that element-wise multiplies the attention output, providing explicit control over updates. Both methods are applied during pre-training, and fine-tuning with gated attention is also explored for pre-trained models.",
        "experimental_setup": "The methods were evaluated on BERT-base-uncased (109M parameters) for Masked Language Modeling (MLM), OPT-125m, OPT-350m, and OPT-1.3B for Causal Language Modeling (CLM), and ViT-S/16 (22M parameters) for image classification. Datasets used include BookCorpus and English Wikipedia for language models, and ImageNet-1K for the vision transformer. For initial outlier analysis, BERT was fine-tuned on the MNLI dataset. Post-training, 8-bit quantization was applied using uniform affine quantization (symmetric weights, asymmetric activations) with static range estimation via a running min-max estimator (exponential moving average over 16 batches), sometimes with 99.99% or 99.999% percentiles for OPT. All weights and activations were quantized except the final linear layer for BERT and OPT. Performance metrics included MLM/CLM perplexity for language models and Top-1 accuracy for ViT. Outlier severity was quantified using the maximum infinity norm and average kurtosis of attention layer outputs. Hyperparameter studies were conducted for clipped softmax's stretch factors (γ, ζ) and gated attention's bias initialization (πinit) and gating module architecture. Training setups closely followed original model papers, with specific sequence lengths (e.g., 128 for BERT pre-training, 512 for OPT), batch sizes, optimizers (AdamW), learning rate schedules, and mixed-precision (FP16). Ablations explored LayerNorm placement and weight decay effects.",
        "limitations": "The scalability of the proposed methods to \"very large transformers that are trained for way longer\" has not been fully explored, although the authors anticipate similar effectiveness due to the fundamental understanding of the underlying issue. The observed small improvements in FP16/FP32 performance are not consistent across all hyperparameters and their generalizability to more architectures and larger models requires further investigation.

This has driven research focused on constructing and assessing specific architectural designs [59] tailored to various tasks. On the theoretical front, mostly the expressive power [51, 26] and computational capabilities [45] of GNNs have been studied. However, there is limited understanding of the underlying learning mechanics. We undertake a classical variant of GNNs, the Graph Attention Network (GAT) [48, 9]. It overcomes the limitation of standard neighborhood representation averaging in GCNs [29, 22] by employing a self-attention mechanism [47] on nodes. Attention performs a weighted aggregation over a node’s neighbors to learn their relative importance. This increases the expressiveness of the neural network. GAT is a popular model that continues to serve as strong baseline. However, a major limitation of message-passing GNNs in general, and therefore GATs as well, is severe performance degradation when the depth of the network is even slightly increased. SOTA results are reportedly achieved by models of 2 or 3 layers. This problem has largely been attributed to over-smoothing [35], a phenomenon in which node representations become indistinguishable when multiple layers are stacked. To relieve GNNs of over-smoothing, practical techniques inspired by classical deep neural networks tweak the training process, e.g. by normalization [11, 64, 65, 66] or regularization [38, 42, 55, 67], and impose architectural changes such as skip connections (dense 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023). arXiv:2310.07235v2  [cs.LG]  25 Oct 2023and residual) [34, 53] or offer other engineering solutions [ 33] or their combinations [ 12]. Other approaches to overcome over-smoothing include learning CNN-like spatial operators from random paths in the graph instead of the point-wise graph Laplacian operator [ 17] and learning adaptive receptive fields (different ‘effective’ neighborhoods for different nodes) [63, 36, 52]. Another problem associated with loss of performance in deeper networks is over-squashing [1], but we do not discuss it since non-attentive models are more susceptible to it, which is not our focus. Alternative causes for the challenged trainability of deeper GNNs beyond over-smoothing is hampered signal propagation during training (i.e. backpropagation) [25, 62, 13]. To alleviate this problem for GCNs, a dynamic addition of skip connections to vanilla-GCNs, which is guided by gradient flow, and a topology-aware isometric initialization are proposed in [ 25]. A combination of orthogonal initialization and regularization facilitates gradient flow in [21]. To the best of our knowledge, these are the only works that discuss the trainability issue of deep GNNs from the perspective of signal propagation, which studies a randomly initialized network at initialization. Here, we offer an insight into a mechanism that allows these approaches to improve the trainability of deeper networks that is related to the entire gradient flow dynamics. We focus in particular on GAT architectures and the specific challenges that are introduced by attention. Our work translates the concept of neuronwise balancedness from traditional deep neural networks to GNNs, where a deeper understanding of gradient dynamics has been developed and norm balanced- ness is a critical assumption that induces successful training conditions. One reason is that the degree of initial balancedness is conserved throughout the training dynamics as described by gradient flow (i.e. a model of gradient descent with infinitesimally small learning rate or step size). Concretely, for fully connected feed-forward networks and deep convolutional neural networks with continuous homogenous activation functions such as ReLUs, the difference between the squared l2-norms of incoming and outgoing parameters to a neuron stays approximately constant during training [ 15, 32]. Realistic optimization elements such as finite learning rates, batch stochasticity, momentum, and weight decay break the symmetries induced by these laws. Yet, gradient flow equations can be extended to take these practicalities into account [31]. Inspired by these advances, we derive a conservation law for GATs with positive homogeneous activation functions such as ReLUs. As GATs are a generalization of GCNs, most aspects of our insights can also be transferred to other architectures. Our consideration of the attention mechanism would also be novel in the context of classic feed-forward architectures and could have intriguing implications for transformers that are of independent interest. In this work, however, we focus on GATs and derive a relationship between model parameters and their gradients, which induces a conservation law under gradient flow. Based on this insight, we identify a reason for the lack of trainability in deeper GATs and GCNs, which can be alleviated with a balanced parameter initialization. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposal is effective in mitigating the highlighted trainability issues, as it leads to considerable training speed-ups and enables significant parameter changes across all layers. This establishes a causal relationship between trainability and parameter balancedness also empirically, as our theory predicts. The main theorem presented in this work serves as a stepping stone to studying the learning dynamics of positive homogeneous models with attention mechanisms such as transformers [47] and in particular, vision transformers which require depth more than NLP transformers[49]. Our contributions are as follows. • We derive a conservation law of gradient flow dynamics for GATs, including its variations such as shared feature weights and multiple attention heads. • This law offers an explanation for the lack of trainability of deeper GATs with standard initialization. • To demonstrate empirically that our theory has established a causal link between balancedness and trainability, we propose a balanced initialization scheme that improves the trainability of deeper networks and attains considerable speedup in training and convergence time, as our theory predicts. 2 Theory: Conservation laws in GATs Preliminaries For a graph G = (V, E) with node set V and edge set E ⊆ V × V , where the neighborhood of a node v is given as N(v) = {u|(u, v) ∈ E}, a GNN layer computes each node’s representation by aggregating over its neighbors’ representation. In GATs, this aggregation is weighted by parameterized attention coefficients αuv, which indicate the importance of node u for v. 2Table 1: Attributes of init. schemes Init. Feat. Attn. Bal.? Xav Xavier Xavier No XavZ Xavier Zero No BalX Xavier Zero Yes BalO LLortho Zero Yes Figure 1: Params. to balance for neuron i ∈ [nl] Given input representations hl−1 v for all nodes v ∈ V , a GAT 1 layer l transforms those to: hl v = ϕ( X u∈N(v) αl uv · Wl shl−1 u ), where (1) αl uv = exp((al)⊤ · LeakyReLU(Wl shl−1 u + Wl t hl−1 v ))P u′∈N(v) exp((al)⊤ · LeakyReLU(Wlshl−1 u′ + Wl t hl−1v ))) . (2) We consider ϕ to be a positively homogeneous activation functions (i.e ϕ(x) =xϕ′(x) and conse- quently, ϕ(ax) =aϕ(x) for positive scalars a), such as a ReLU ϕ(x) = max{x, 0} or LeakyReLU ϕ(x) = max{x, 0} + −α max{−x, 0}. The feature transformation weights Ws and Wt for source and target nodes, respectively, may also be shared such that W = Ws = Wt. Definition 2.1. Given training data {(xm, ym)}M m=1 ⊂ Rd × Rp for M ≤ V , let f : Rd → Rp be the function represented by a network constructed by stacking L GAT layers as defined in Eq. (1) and (2) with W = Ws = Wt and h0 m = g(xm). Each layer l ∈ [L] of size nl has associated parameters: a feature weight matrix Wl ∈ Rnl×nl−1 and an attention vector al ∈ Rnl, where n0 = d and nL = p. Given a differentiable loss function ℓ : Rd × Rp → R, the loss L = 1/M PM i=1 ℓ(f(xm), ym) is used to update model parameters w ∈ {Wl, al}L l=1 with learning rate γ by gradient descent, i.e., wt+1 = wt − γ∇wL, where ∇wL = [∂L/∂w1, . . . ,∂L/∂w|w|] and w0 is set by the initialization scheme. For an infinitesimal γ → 0, the dynamics of gradient descent behave similarly to gradient flow defined by dw/dt = −∇wL, where t is the continuous time index. We useW[i, :], W[:, i], and a[i] to denote the ith row of W, column of W, and entry ofa, respectively. Note that Wl[i, :] is the vector of weights incoming to neuron i ∈ [nl] and Wl+1[:, i] is the vector of weights outgoing from the same neuron. For the purpose of discussion, let i ∈ [dl], j∈ [dl−1], and k ∈ [dl+1], as depicted in Fig. 1. ⟨·, ·⟩ denotes the scalar product. Conservation Laws We focus the following exposition on weight-sharing GATs, as this variant has the practical benefit that it requires fewer parameters. Yet, similar laws also hold for the non-weight- sharing case, as we state and discuss in the supplement. For brevity, we also defer the discussion of laws for the multi-headed attention mechanism to the supplement. Theorem 2.2 (Structure of gradients). Given the feature weight and attention parameters Wl and al of a layer l in a GAT network as described in Def. 2.1, the structure of the gradients for layer l ∈ [L − 1] in the network is conserved according to the following law: ⟨Wl[i, :], ∇Wl[i,:]L⟩ − ⟨al[i], ∇al[i]L⟩ = ⟨Wl+1[:, i], ∇Wl+1[:,i]L⟩. (3) Corollary 2.3 (Norm conservation of weights incoming and outgoing at every neuron). Given the gradient structure of Theorem 2.2 and positive homogeneity of the activation ϕ in Eq. (1), gradient flow in the network adheres to the following invariance for l ∈ [L − 1]: d dt \u0010\r\rWl[i, :] \r\r2 − \r\ral[i] \r\r2\u0011 = d dt \u0010\r\rWl+1[: i] \r\r2\u0011 , (4) 1This definition of GAT is termed GATv2 in [9]. Hereafter, we refer to GATv2 as GAT. 3(a) δ with GD  (b) δ with Adam  (c) c with Xavier  (d) c with BalO Figure 2: Visualizing conservation laws: (a),(b) show δ ≈ 0 (can not empirically be exactly zero due to finite γ = 0.1) from Eq. (7) for hidden layers when L = 3. (c),(d) show the value of c from Eq. (5), which is determined by the initialization and should be 0 when the network is balanced, for L = 10 trained with GD. With Xav., the network is unbalanced and hence c ̸= 0for all neurons. With BalO, c = 0exactly at initialization for all neurons by design but during training, it varies slightly andc ≈ 0 as the network becomes slightly unbalanced due to the finite γ = 0.1. As both δ and c approximately meet their required value, we conclude that the derived law holds for practical purposes as well. It then directly follows by integration over time that the l2-norms of feature and attention weights incoming to and outgoing from a neuron are preserved such that \r\rWl[i, :] \r\r2 − \r\ral[i] \r\r2 − \r\rWl+1[: i] \r\r2 = c, (5) where c = d dt \u0010\r\rWl[i, :] \r\r2 − \r\ral[i] \r\r2\u0011 at initialization (i.e. t = 0). We denote the ‘degree of balancedness’ by c and call an initialization balanced if c = 0. Corollary 2.4 (Norm conservation across layers). Given Eq. (4), the invariance of gradient flow at the layer level for l ∈ [L − 1] by summing over i ∈ [nl] is: d dt \u0010\r\rWl\r\r2 F − \r\ral\r\r2\u0011 = d dt \u0010\r\rWl+1\r\r2 F \u0011 . (6) Remark 2.5. Similar conservation laws also hold for the original less expressive GAT version [48] as well as for the vanilla GCN [29] yielded by fixing al = 0. Insights We first verify our theory and then discuss its implications in the context of four different initializations for GATs, which are summarized in Table 1. Xavier (Xav.) initialization [19] is the standard default for GATs. We describe the Looks-Linear-Orthogonal (LLortho) initialization later. In order to empirically validate Theorem 2.2, we rewrite Equation 3 to define δ as: δ = ⟨Wl[i, :], ∇Wl[i,:]L⟩ − ⟨al, ∇alL⟩ − ⟨Wl+1[:, i], ∇Wl+1[:,i]L⟩ = 0. (7) We observe how the value of δ varies during training in Fig. 2 for both GD and Adam optimizers with γ = 0.1. Although the theory assumes infinitesimal learning rates due to gradient flow, it still holds sufficiently (δ ≈ 0) in practice for normally used learning rates as we validate in Fig. 2. Furthermore, although the theory assumes vanilla gradient descent optimization, it still holds for the Adam optimizer (Fig. 2b). This is so because the derived law on the level of scalar products between gradients and parameters (see Theorem 2.2) still holds, as it states a relationship between gradients and parameters that is independent of the learning rate or precise gradient updates. Having verified Theorem 2.2, we use it to deduce an explanation for a major trainability issue of GATs with Xavier initialization that is amplified with increased network depth. The main reason is that the last layer has a comparatively small average weight norm, as E \r\rWL[:, i] \r\r2 = 2nL/(nL + nL−1) << 1, where the number of outputs is smaller than the layer width nL << nL−1. In contrast, E \r\rWL−1[i, :] \r\r2 = 2nL−1/(nL−1 + nL−2) = 1 and EaL−1[i]2 = 2/(1 +nL−1). In consequence, the right-hand side of our derived conservation law nL−2X j=1 (WL−1 ij )2 ∇WL−1 ij L WL−1 ij − (aL−1 i )2 ∇aL−1 i L aL−1 i = nLX k=1 (WL ki)2 ∇WL ki L WL ki (8) 4(a) Frac. of sig. params with relative change > 0.05  (b) Rel. grad. norms of feat. wghts. & training curve Figure 3: For L = 5, a high fraction of parameters change, and gradients propagate to earlier layers for both the unbalanced and balanced initialization Xav. and BalO initialization achieve 75.5% and 79.9% test accuracy, respectively.

(a) Frac. of sig. params with relative change > 0.5  (b) Rel. grad. norms of feat. wghts. & training curve Figure 4: For L = 10, unbalanced initialization is unable to train the model as relative gradients are extremely small, and the parameters (and loss) do not change. However, the balanced initialization is able to propagate gradients, change parameters, and thus attain training loss → 0. Xav. and Bal O achieve 39.3% and 80.2% test accuracy, respectively. Note that the balanced initialization in (b) is also able to train faster than the 5 layer network with Xavier initialization in Fig. 3b. is relatively small, as PnL k=1(WL ki)2 << 1, on average, while the weights on the left-hand side are orders of magnitude larger. This implies that the relative gradients on the left-hand side are likely relatively small to meet the equality unless all the signs of change are set in such a way that they satisfy the equality, which is highly unlikely during training. Therefore, relative gradients in layer L −1 and accordingly also the previous layers of the same dimension can only change in minor ways. The amplification of this trainability issue with depth can also be explained by the recursive substitu- tion of Theorem 2.2 in Eq. (8) that results in a telescoping series yielding: n1X j=1 n0X m=1 W(1) jm 2 ∇W(1) jm L W(1) jm − L−1X l=1 nlX o=1 a(l) o 2 ∇a(l) o L a(l) o = nL−1X i=1 nLX k=1 W(L) ki 2 ∇W(L) ki L W(L) ki (9) Generally, 2n1 < n0 and thus E \r\rW1[j :] \r\r2 = 2n1/(n1 + n0) < 1. Since the weights in the first layer and the gradients propagated to the first layer are both small, gradients of attention parameters of the intermediate hidden layers must also be very small in order to satisfy Eq. (9). Evidently, the problem aggravates with depth where the same value must now be distributed over the parameters and gradients of more layers. Note that the norms of the first and last layers are usually not arbitrary but rather determined by the input and output scale of the network. Analogously, we can see see how a balanced initialization would mitigate the problem. Equal weight norms \r\rWL−1[i, :] \r\r2 and \r\rWL[:, i] \r\r2 in Eq. (8) (as the attention parameters are set to 0 during balancing, see Procedure 2.6) would allow larger relative gradients in layerL − 1, as compared to the imbalanced case, that can enhance gradient flow in the network to earlier layers. In other words, gradients on both sides of the equation have equal room to drive parameter change. 5Figure 5: Relative gradient norms of feature (left axis, solid) and of attention (right axis, stylized) parameters for l ∈ [1, 5, 10] and L = 10, sampled every 25 epochs. Test accuracy is at the top. Both attention and feature gradients at the first, middle, and last layer of the network with both balanced initializations are much larger than with unbalanced initialization (note axis scales). To visualize the trainability issue, we study the relative change |(w∗−w0)/w∗|. of trained network parameters (w∗) w.r.t. their initial value. In order to observe meaningful relative change, we only con- sider parameters with a significant contribution to the model output (w∗ ≥ 10−4). We also plot the rel- ative gradient norms of the feature weights across all layers to visualize their propagation. We display these values forL = 5and L = 10in Fig. 3 and 4, respectively, and observe a stark contrast, similar to the trends in relative gradient norms of selected layers of a 10 layer GAT in Fig. 5. In all experiments, GAT was trained with the specified initialization on Cora using GD with γ = 0.1 for 5000 epochs. Interestingly, the attention parameters change most in the first layer and increasingly more towards the last layer, as seen in Fig. 3a and 4a. This is consistently observed in both the 5 and 10 layer networks if the initialization is balanced, but with unbalanced initialization, the 10 layer network is unable to produce the same effect. As our theory defines a coarse-level conservation law, such fine-grained training dynamics cannot be completely explained by it. Since the attention parameters are set to 0 in the balanced initializations (see Procedure 2.6), as ablation, we also observe the effect of initializing attention and feature parameters with zero and Xavier, respectively. From Eq.(2), al = 0leads to αuv = 1/|N(v)|, implying that all neighbors u of the node v are equally important at initialization. Intuitively, this allows the network to learn the importance of neighbors without any initially introduced bias and thus avoids the ‘chicken and egg’ problem that arises in the initialization of attention over nodes[30]. Although this helps generalization in some cases (see Fig. 6), it alone does not help the trainability issue as seen in Fig. 4a. It may in fact worsen it (see Fig. 5), which is explained by Eq. 8. These observations underline the further need for parameter balancing. Procedure 2.6 (Balancing). Based on Eq. (5) from the norm preservation law 2.3, we note that in order to achieve balancedness, (i.e. set c = 0in Eq.(5)), the randomly initialized parameters Wl and al must satisfy the following equality for l ∈ [L]: \r\rWl[i, :] \r\r2 − \r\ral[i] \r\r2 = \r\rWl+1[: i] \r\r2 This can be achieved by scaling the randomly initialized weights as follows: 1. Set al = 0 for l ∈ [L]. 2. Set W1[i, :] = W1[i,:] ∥W1[i,:]∥ √βi, for i ∈ [n1] where βi is a hyperparameter 3. Set Wl+1[:, i] = Wl+1[:,i] ∥Wl+1[:,i]∥ \r\rWl[i, :] \r\r for i ∈ [nl] and l ∈ [L − 1] In step 2, βi determines the initial squared norm of the incoming weights to neuron i in the first layer. It can be any constant thus also randomly sampled from a normal or uniform distribution. We explain why we set βi = 2for i ∈ [n1] in the context of an orthogonal initialization. Remark 2.7. This procedure balances the network starting from l = 1towards l = L. Yet, it could also be carried out in reverse order by first defining \r\rWL[:, i] \r\r2 = βi for i ∈ [nL−1]. Balanced Orthogonal Initialization The feature weights Wl for l ∈ [L] need to be initialized randomly before balancing, which can simply be done by using Xavier initialization. However, existing works have pointed out benefits of orthogonal initialization to achieve initial dynamical 6(a) Test accuracy (higher is better).  (b) Epochs to best model (lower is better). Figure 6: GAT trained on Cora using SGD isometry for DNNs and CNNs [37, 44, 23], as it enables training very deep architectures. In line with these findings, we initialize Wl, before balancing, to be an orthogonal matrix with a looks-linear (LL) mirrored block structure [46, 6], that achieves perfect dynamical isometry in perceptrons with ReLU activation functions. Due to the peculiarity of neighborhood aggregation, the same technique does not induce perfect dynamical isometry in GATs (or GNNs). Exploring how dynamical isometry can be achieved or approximated in general GNNs could be an interesting direction for future work. Nevertheless, using a (balanced) LL-orthogonal initialization enhances trainaibility, particularly of deeper models. We defer further discussion on the effects of orthogonal initialization, such as with identity matrices, to the appendix. We outline the initialization procedure as follows: Let ∥ and |= denote row-wise and column- wise matrix concatenation, respectively. Let us draw a random orthonormal submatrix Ul and define W1 = [U1 ∥ −U1] where U1 ∈ R n1 2 ×n0 , Wl = [[Ul ∥ −Ul] |= [−Ul ∥ Ul]] where Ul ∈ R nl 2 × nl−1 2 for l = {2, . . . , L− 1}, and WL = [UL |= −UL] where UL ∈ RnL× nl−1 2 . Since UL is an orthonormal matrix, \r\rWL[:, i] \r\r2 = 2by definition, and by recursive application of Eq. (2.3 (with al = 0), balancedness requires that \r\rW1[i :, ] \r\r2 = 2. Therefore, we set βi = 2for i ∈ n1. 3 Experiments The main purpose of our experiments is to verify the validity of our theoretical insights and deduce an explanation for a major trainability issue of GATs that is amplified with increased network depth. Based on our theory, we understand the striking observation in Figure 4a that the parameters of default Xavier initialized GATs struggle to change during training. We demonstrate the validity of our theory with the nature of our solution. As we balance the parameter initialization (see Procedure 2.6), we allow the gradient signal to pass through the network layers, which enables parameter changes during training in all GAT layers. In consequence, balanced initialization schemes achieve higher generalization performance and significant training speed ups in comparison with the default Xavier initialization. It also facilitates training deeper GAT models. To analyze this effect systematically, we study the different GAT initializations listed in Table 1 on generalization (in % accuracy) and training speedup (in epochs) using nine common benchmark datasets for semi-supervised node classification tasks. We defer dataset details to the supplement. We use the standard provided train/validation/test splits and have removed the isolated nodes from Citeseer. We use the Pytorch Geometric framework and run our experiments on either Nvidia T4 Tensor Core GPU with 15 GB RAM or Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU with 6 GB RAM. We allow each network to train, both with SGD and Adam, for 5000 epochs (unless it converges earlier, i.e. achieves training loss ≤ 10−4) and select the model state with the highest validation accuracy. For each experiment, the mean ±95% confidence interval over five runs is reported for accuracy and epochs to the best model. All reported results use ReLU activation, weight sharing and no biases, unless stated otherwise. No weight sharing leads to similar trends, which we therefore omit. SGD We first evaluate the performance of the different initialization schemes of GAT models using vanilla gradient descent. Since no results have been previously reported using SGD on these datasets, to the best of our knowledge, we find that setting a learning rate of 0.1, 0.05 and 0.005 for L = [2, 5], L = [10, 20], and L = 40, respectively, allows for reasonably stable training on Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed. For the remaining datasets, we set the learning rate to 0.05, 0.01, 0.005 and 0.0005 for 7Table 2: Mean accuracy(%) ± 95% CI over five runs of GAT with width= 64trained using SGD. Init.

Note that we do not perform fine-tuning of the learning rate or other hyperparameters with respect to performance and use the same settings for all initializations to allow fair comparison. Figure 6 highlights that models initialized with balanced parameters, Bal O, consistently achieve the best accuracy and significantly speed up training, even on shallow models of 2 layers. In line with our theory, the default Xavier (Xav) initialization hampers model training (see also Figure 4a). Interestingly, the default Xavier (Xav) initialized deeper models tend to improve in performance with width but cannot compete with balanced initialization schemes. For example, the accuracy achieved by Xav for L = 10increases from 24.7% to 68.7% when the width is increased from 64 to 512. We hypothesize that the reason why width aids generalization performance is that a higher number of (almost random) features supports better models. This would also be in line with studies of overparameterization in vanilla feed-forward architectures, where higher width also aids random feature models [2, 4, 57, 43]. The observation that width overparameterized models enable training deeper models may be of independent interest in the context of how overparameterization in GNNs may be helpful. However, training wider and deeper (hence overall larger) models is computationally inefficient, even for datasets with the magnitude of Cora. In contrast, the BalO initialized model for L = 10is already able to attain 79.7% even with width= 64and improves to 80.9% with width= 512. Primarily the 8(a) Test accuracy.  (b) Epochs to convergence. Figure 7: GAT with 64 hidden dimensions trained using Adam. parameter balancing must be responsible for the improved performance, as it is not sufficient to simply initialize the attention weights to zero, as shown in Figure 4a and 5. For the remaining datasets, we report only the performance of networks with 64 hidden dimension in Table 2 for brevity. Since we have considered the XavZ initialization only as an ablation study and find it to be ineffective (see Figure 6a), we do not discuss it any further. Note that for some datasets (e.g.Pubmed, Wisconsin), deeper models (e.g. L = 40) are unable to train at all with Xavier initialization, which explains the high variation in test accuracy across multiple runs as, in each run, the model essentially remains a random network. The reduced performance even with balanced initialization at higher depth may be due to a lack of convergence within5000 epochs. Nevertheless, the fact that the drop in performance is not drastic, but rather gradual as depth increases, indicates that the network is being trained, i.e. trainability is not an issue. As a stress test, we validate that GAT networks with balanced initialization maintain their trainability at even larger depths of 64 and 80 layers (see Fig. 9 in appendix). In fact, the improved performance and training speed-up of models with balanced initialization as opposed to models with standard initialization is upheld even more so for very deep networks. Apart from Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed, the other datasets are considered heterophilic in nature and standard GNN models do not perform very well on them. State-of-the-art performance on these datasets is achieved by specialized models. We do not compare with them for two reasons: i) they do not employ an attention mechanism, which is the focus of our investigations, but comprise various special architectural elements and ii) our aim is not to outperform the SOTA, but rather highlight a mechanism that underlies the learning dynamics and can be exploited to improve trainability. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of a balanced initialization in training deep GATs in comparison to LipschitzNorm [14], a normalization technique proposed specifically for training deep GNNs with self-attention layers such as GAT (see Table 6 in appendix). Adam Adam, the most commonly used optimizer for GNNs, stabilizes the training dynamics and can compensate partially for problematic initializations. However, the drop in performance with depth, though smaller, is inevitable with unbalanced initialization. As evident from Figure 7, BalO initialized models achieve higher accuracy than or at par with Xavier initialization and converge in fewer epochs. As we observe with SGD, this difference becomes more prominent with depth, despite the fact that Adam itself significantly improves the trainability of deeper networks over SGD. Our argument of small relative gradients (see Eq.(8)) also applies to Adam. We have used the initial learning rates reported in the literature [9]: 0.005 for Cora and Citeseer, and 0.01 for Pubmed for the 2 and 5 layer networks. To allow stable training of deeper networks, we reduce the initial learning rate by a factor 0.1 for the 10 and 20 layer networks on all three datasets. Architectural variations We also consider other architectural variations such as employing ELUs instead of ReLUs, using multiple attention heads, turning off weight sharing, and addition of standard elements such as weight decay and dropout. In all cases, the results follow a similar tendency as already reported. Due to a lack of space, we defer the exact results to the appendix. These variations further increase the performance of networks with our initialization proposals, which can therefore be regarded as complementary. Note that residual skip connections between layers are also supported 9in a balanced initialization provided their parameters are initialized with zero. However, to isolate the contribution of the initialization scheme and validate our theoretical insights, we have focused our exposition on the vanilla GAT version. Limitations The derived conservation law only applies to the self-attention defined in the original GAT and GATv2 models, and their architectural variations such as ωGAT[18] (see Fig. 10 in appendix). Note that the law also holds for the non-attentive GCNs (see Table 7 in appendix) which are a special case of GATs (where the attention parameters are simply zero). Modeling different kinds of self-attention such as the dot-product self-attention in [28] entails modification of the conservation law, which has been left for future work. 4 Discussion GATs [9] are powerful graph neural network models that form a cornerstone of learning from graph- based data. The dynamic attention mechanism provides them with high functional expressiveness, as they can flexibly assign different importance to neighbors based on their features. However, as we slightly increase the network depth, the attention and feature weights face difficulty changing during training, which prevents us from learning deeper and more complex models. We have derived an explanation of this issue in the form of a structural relationship between the gradients and parameters that are associated with a feature. This relationship implies a conservation law that preserves a sum of the respective squared weight and attention norms during gradient flow. Accordingly, if weight and attention norms are highly unbalanced as is the case in standard GAT initialization schemes, relative gradients for larger parameters do not have sufficient room to increase. This phenomenon is similar in nature to the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime [ 24, 54], where only the last linear layer of a classic feed-forward neural network architecture can adapt to a task. Conservation laws for basic feed-forward architectures [15, 3, 32] do not require an infinite width assumption like NTK-related theory and highlight more nuanced issues for trainability. Furthermore, they are intrinsically linked to implicit regularization effects during gradient descent [41]. Our results are of independent interest also in this context, as we incorporate the attention mechanism into the analysis, which has implications for sequence models and transformers as well. One of these implications is that an unbalanced initialization hampers the trainability of the involved parameters. Yet, the identification of the cause already contains an outline for its solution. Balancing the initial norms of feature and attention weights leads to more effective parameter changes and significantly faster convergence during training, even in shallow architectures. To further increase the trainability of feature weights, we endow them with a balanced orthogonal looks-linear structure, which induces perfect dynamical isometry in perceptrons [10] and thus enables signal to pass even through very deep architectures. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets have verified the validity of our theoretical insights and isolated the effect of different modifications of the initial parameters on the trainability of GATs. 5 Acknowledgements We gratefully acknowledge funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the Horizon Europe Framework Programme (HORIZON) for proposal number 101116395 SPARSE-ML. 10References [1] Uri Alon and Eran Yahav.

Scalar and element-wise products are denoted ⟨, ⟩ and ⊙, respectively. Boldface lowercase and uppercase symbols represent vectors and matrices, respectively. Our proof of Theorem 2.2 utilizes a rescale invariance that follows from Noether’s theorem, as stated by [31]. Note that we could also derive the gradient structure directly from the derivatives, but the rescale invariance is easier to follow. Definition 6.1 (Rescale invariance). The loss L(θ) is rescale invariant with respect to disjoint subsets of the parameters θ1 and θ2 if for every λ >0 we have L(θ) =L((λθ1, λ−1θ2, θd)), where θ = (θ1, θ2, θd). We frequently utilize the following relationship. Lemma 6.2 (Gradient structure due to rescale invariance [31]). The rescale invariance of L enforces the following geometric constraint on the gradients of the loss with respect to its parameters: ⟨θ1, ∇θ1 L⟩ − ⟨θ2, ∇θ2 L⟩ = 0. (10) We first use this rescale invariance to prove our main theorem for a GAT with shared feature transformation weights and a single attention head, as described in Def. 2.1. The underlying principle generalizes to other GAT versions as well, as we exemplify with two other variants. Firstly, we study the case of unshared weights for feature transformation of source and target nodes. Secondly, we discuss multiple attention heads. Proof of Theorem 2.2 Our main proof strategy relies on identifying a multiplicative rescale invariance in GATs that allows us to apply Lemma 6.2. We identify rescale invariances for every neuron i at layer l that induce the stated gradient structure. Specifically, we define the components of in-coming weights to the neuron as θ1 = {w | w ∈ Wl[i, : ]} and the union of all out-going edges (regarding features and attention) as θ2 = {w | w ∈ Wl+1[: , i]} ∪ {al[i]}. It is left to show that these parameters are invariant under rescaling. Let us, therefore, evaluate the GAT loss at λθ1 and λ−1θ2 and show that it remains invariant for any choice of λ >0. Note that the only components of the network that potentially change under rescaling are hl u[i], hl+1 v [j], and αl uv. We denote the scaled network components with a tilde resulting in ˜hl u[i], ˜hl+1 v [k], and ˜αl uv As we show, parameters of upper layers remain unaffected, as ˜hl+1 v [k] coincides with its original non-scaled variant ˜hl+1 v [k] =hl+1 v [k]. Let us start with the attention coefficients. Note that ˜al[i] =λ−1al[i] and ˜Wl[i, j] =λWl[i, j]. This implies that ˜αl uv = exp(el uv)P u′∈N(v) exp(eluv) = αl uv , because (11) ˜el uv = (al)⊤ · ϕ2(Wl(hl−1 u + hl−1 v )) =el uv, (12) which follows from the positive homogeneity of ϕ2 that allows ˜el uv = λ−1al[i]ϕ2( nl−1X j λWl[i, j](hl−1 u [j] +hl−1 v [j]) + nlX i′̸=i al[i]ϕ2( nl−1X j Wl[i, j](hl−1 u [j] +hl−1 v [j]) (13) = λ−1λal[i]ϕ2( nl−1X j Wl[i, j](hl−1 u [j] +hl−1 v [j]) + nlX i′̸=i al[i]ϕ2( nl−1X j Wl[i, j](hl−1 u [j] +hl−1 v [j]) (14) = el uv. (15) 15Since ˜αl uv = αl uv, it follows that ˜hu l [i] =ϕ1   X z∈N(u) αl zu nl−1X j λWl[i, j]hl−1 z [j]   = λϕ1   X z∈N(u) αl zu nl−1X j Wl[i, j]hl−1 z [j]   = λhl u[i] In the next layer, we therefore have ˜hl+1 v [k] =ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i λ−1Wl+1[k, i]˜hl u[i]   = ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i λ−1Wl+1[k, i]λhl u[i]   = ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i Wl+1[k, i]hl u[i]   = hl+1 v [k] Thus, the output node representations of the network remain unchanged, and according to Def. 6.1, the loss L is rescale-invariant. Consequently, as per Lemma 6.2, the constraint in Eq.(10) can be written as: ⟨Wl[i, :], ∇Wl[i,:]L⟩ − ⟨al[i], ∇al[i]L⟩ − ⟨Wl+1[:, i], ∇Wl+1[:,i]L⟩ = 0. which can be rearranged to Eq.((2.2): ⟨Wl[i, :], ∇Wl[i,:]L⟩ − ⟨al[i], ∇al[i]L⟩ = ⟨Wl+1[:, i], ∇Wl+1[:,i]L⟩. thus proving Theorem 2.2. Proof of Corollary 2.3 Given that gradient flow applied on loss L is captured by the differential equation dw dt = −∇wL (16) which implies: d dt \r\rWl[i, :] \r\r2 = 2⟨Wl[i, :], d dtWl[i, :]⟩ = −2⟨Wl[i, :], ∇Wl[i,:]L⟩ (17) substituting in Eq.(4) similarly for gradient flow of Wl+1[:, i] and al[i], as done in Eq.(17) yields Theorem 2.2: d dt \u0010\r\rWl[i, :] \r\r2 − \r\ral[i] \r\r2\u0011 = d dt \u0010\r\rWl+1[: i] \r\r2\u0011 . −2⟨Wl[i, :], ∇Wl[i,:]L⟩ −(−2)⟨al[i], ∇al[i]L⟩ = −2⟨Wl+1[:, i], ∇Wl+1[:,i]L⟩. Therefore, Eq.(4) and consequently Eq.(5) in Corollary 2.3 hold. Summing over i ∈ [nl] on both sides of Eq.(4) yields Corollary 2.4. 16Theorem 6.3 (Structure of gradients for GAT without weight-sharing). Let a GAT network as defined by Def. 2.1 consisting of L layers be given. The feature transformation parameters Wl s and Wl t of the source and target nodes of an edge and attention parametersal of a GAT layer l are defined according to Eq.(1) and (2). Then the gradients for layer l ∈ [L − 1] in the network are governed by the following law: ⟨Wl s[i, :], ∇Wls[i,:]L⟩ + ⟨Wl t [i, :], ∇Wl t [i,:]L⟩ − ⟨al[i], ∇al[i]L⟩ = ⟨Wl+1 s [:, i], ∇Wl+1 s [:,i]L⟩ (18) Proof. The proof is analogous to the derivation of Theorem 2.2. We follow the same principles and define the disjoint subsets θ1 and θ2 of the parameter set θ, associated with a neuron i in layer l accordingly, as follows: θ1 = {w|w ∈ Wl s[i, :]} ∪ {w|w ∈ Wl t [i, :]} θ2 = {w|w ∈ Wl+1 s [:, i]} ∪ {al[i]} Then, the invariance of node representations follows similarly to the proof of Theorem 2.2. The only components of the network that potentially change under rescaling are hl u[i], hl+1 v [j], and αl uv. We denote the scaled network components with a tilde resulting in ˜hl u[i], ˜hl+1 v [k], and ˜αl uv As we show, parameters of upper layers remain unaffected, as ˜hl+1 v [k] coincides with its original non-scaled variant ˜hl+1 v [k] =hl+1 v [k]. Let us start with the attention coefficients. Note that ˜al[i] =λ−1al[i], ˜Ws l [i, j] = λWl s[i, j] and ˜Wl t [i, j] =λWl t [i, j]. This implies that ˜αl uv = exp(el uv)P u′∈N(v) exp(eluv) = αl uv , because (19) ˜el uv = (al)⊤ · ϕ2(Wl shl−1 u + Wl t hl−1 v ) =el uv, (20) which follows from the positive homogeneity of ϕ2 that allows ˜el uv = λ−1al[i]ϕ2( nl−1X j λWl s[i, j]hl−1 u [j] +λWl t [i, j]hl−1 v [j] (21) + nlX i′̸=i al[i]ϕ2( nl−1X j Wl s[i, j]hl−1 u [j] +Wl t [i, j]hl−1 v [j]) (22) = λ−1λal[i]ϕ2( nl−1X j Wl s[i, j]hl−1 u [j] +Wl t [i, j]hl−1 v [j] (23) + nlX i′̸=i al[i]ϕ2( nl−1X j Wl s[i, j]hl−1 u [j] +Wl t [i, j]hl−1 v [j]) (24) = el uv. (25) Since ˜αl uv = αl uv, it follows that ˜hu l [i] =ϕ1   X z∈N(u) αl zu nl−1X j λWl s[i, j]hl−1 z [j]   = λϕ1   X z∈N(u) αl zu nl−1X j Wl s[i, j]hl−1 z [j]   = λhl u[i] 17In the next layer, we therefore have ˜hv l+1 [k] =ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i λ−1Wl+1 s [k, i]˜hl u[i]   = ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i λ−1Wl+1 s [k, i]λhl u[i]   = ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i Wl+1 s [k, i]hl u[i]   = hl+1 v [k] Thus, the application of Lemma 6.2 derives Theorem 6.3. Theorem 6.4 (Structure of gradients for GAT with multi-headed attention) . Given the feature transformation parameters Wl k and attention parameters al k of an attention head k ∈ [K] in a GAT layer of a L layer network. Then the gradients of layer l ∈ [L − 1] respect the law: KX k ⟨Wl k[i, :], ∇Wl k[i,:]L⟩ − KX k ⟨al k[i], ∇al k[i]L⟩ = KX k ⟨Wl+1 k [:, i], ∇Wl+1 k [:,i]L⟩. (26) Proof. Each attention head is independently defined by Eq.1 and Eq.2, and thus Theorem 2.2 holds for each head, separately. The aggregation of multiple heads in a layer is done over node representations of each head in either one of two ways: Concatenation: hl v =∥K k ϕ(P u∈N(v) αkuv l · Wl khl−1 u ) , or Average: hl v = 1 K PK k ϕ(P u∈N(v) αkuv l · Wl khl−1 u ) Thus, the rescale invariance and consequent structure of gradients of the parameters in each head are not altered and Eq.(6.2) holds by summation of the conservation law over all heads. For the most general case of a GAT layer without weight-sharing and with multi-headed attention, each term in Theorem 6.3 is summed over all heads. Further implications analogous to Corollary 2.3, and 2.4 can be derived for these variants by similar principles. 7 Training Dynamics In the main paper, we have shared observations regarding the learning dynamics of GAT networks of varying depths with standard initialization and or balanced initialization schemes. Here, we report additional figures for more varied depths to complete the picture. All figures in this section correspond to a L layer GAT network trained on Cora. For SGD, the learning rate is set to γ = 0.1, γ = 0.05 and γ = 0.01 for L = 5, L = 10and L = 20, respectively. For Adam, γ = 0.005 and γ = 0.0001 for L = 5and L = 10, respectively. Relative change of a feature transformation parameter w is defined as |(w∗−w0)/w∗| where w0 is the initialized value and w∗ is the value for the model with maximum validation accuracy during training. Absolute change |a∗ − a0| is used for attention parameters a since attention parameters are initialized with 0 in the balanced initialization. We view the fraction of parameters that remain unchanged during training separately in Figure 8, and examine the layer-wise distribution of change in parameters in Figure 11 without considering the unchanged parameters. To analyze how gradients vary in the network during training, we define the relative gradient norm of feature transformation and attention parameters for a layer l as ∥∇WlWl∥F/∥Wl∥F and ∥∇alal∥/∥al∥, respectively. Figures 3b and 4b, and Figure 12 depict relative gradient norms for training under SGD and Adam respectively. 18(a) L = 5  (b) L = 10  (c) L = 20 Figure 8: Layer-wise fraction of feature transformation parameters Wl and attention parameters al with zero relative and absolute change, respectively, trained with SGD. For L = 2, no parameters with zero change existed. A small number of feature weights do not change in a 5 layer unbalanced network initialized with Xavier, but this fraction becomes significantly large when depth is increased to L = 10. Note that W1 contains a much larger number of parameters compared to the intermediate layers (specifically in this case, though it is generally common). At L = 20, nearly all w ∈ Wl with an unbalanced initialization (Xav. and Xav+ZeroAtt) struggle to change during training, whereas the balanced Xavier and LL-orthogonal initialization are able to drive change in most w ∈ Wl and all a ∈ al parameters, allowing the network to train. 8 Additional Results The results of the main paper have focused on the vanilla GAT having ReLU activation between consecutive layers, a single attention head, and shared weights for feature transformation of the source and target nodes, optimized with vanilla gradient descent (or Adam) without any regularization. Here, we present additional results for training with architectural variations, comparing a balanced initialization with a normalization scheme focused on GATs, and discussing the impact of an orthogonal initialization and the applicability of the derived conservation law to other message- passing GNNs (MPGNNs). Training variations To understand the impact of different architectural variations, common regular- ization strategies such as dropout and weight decay, and different activation functions, we conducted additional experiments. For a 10-layer network with width 64, Table 3 and 4 report our results for SGD and Adam, respectively. The values of hyperparameters were taken from [48].

Dropout generally does not seem to be helpful to the deeper network ( L = 10), regardless of the initialization. From Table 3 and 4, it is evident that although techniques like dropout and weight decay may aid optimization, they are 19Table 4: Mean test accuracy(%) ± 95% CI over five runs of GAT trained on Cora using Adam Variation L Xav Bal X BalO None (Vanilla GAT) 5 76 .18 ± 1.61 79 .38 ± 2.24 80.20 ± 0.57 10 70 .86 ± 3.99 75 .72 ± 2.35 79.62 ± 1.27 attention heads = 8 5 75 .62 ± 1.74 78 .54 ± 1.06 79.56 ± 0.85 10 70 .94 ± 2.76 75 .48 ± 2.48 79.74 ± 1.10 activation = ELU 5 76 .56 ± 1.72 78 .72 ± 1.02 79.56 ± 0.64 10 75 .30 ± 1.42 78.48 ± 1.79 76.52 ± 0.97 dropout = 0.6 5 76 .74 ± 1.44 78 .42 ± 1.28 79.92 ± 0.48 10 32 .48 ± 6.99 31 .76 ± 1.33 76.34 ± 0.95 weight decay = 0.0005 5 75 .10 ± 2.05 78 .52 ± 1.41 79.80 ± 0.63 10 28 .74 ± 12.04 74 .68 ± 3.06 79.70 ± 1.14 weight sharing = False 5 76 .56 ± 1.72 78 .72 ± 1.02 79.56 ± 0.64 10 71 .12 ± 2.23 73 .32 ± 1.23 79.46 ± 1.16 alone not enough to enable the trainability of deeper network GATs and thus are complementary to balancedness. Note that ELU is not a positively homogeneous activation function, which is an assumption in out theory. In practice, however, it does not impact the Xavier-balanced initialization (Bal X). However, the Looks-Linear orthogonal structure is specific to ReLUs. Therefore, the orthogonality and balancedness of the Bal O initialization are negatively impacted by ELU, although the Adam optimizer seems to compensate for it to some extent. In addition to increasing the trainability of deeper networks, the balanced initialization matches the state-of-the-art performance of Xavier initialized 2 layer GAT, given the architecture and optimization hyperparameters as reported in [48]. We used an existing GAT implementation and training script2 of Cora that follows the original GAT(v1)[48] paper and added our balanced initialization to the code. As evident from Table 5, the balanced initialization matches SOTA performance of GAT(v1) on Cora (83-84%) (on a version of the dataset with duplicate edges). GAT(v2) achieved 78.5% accuracy on Pubmed but the corresponding hyperparameter values were not reported. Hence, we transferred them from [48]. This way, we are able to match the state-of-the-art performance of GAT(v2) on Pubmed, as shown in Table 5.

We use their provided code to reproduce their experiments on Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed for 2,5,10,20 and 40-layer GATs with Lipschitz normalization and compare them with LLortho+Bal initialization in Table 6. Note that Lipschitz normalization has been shown to outperform other previous normalization techniques for GNNs such as pair-norm [64] and layer-norm [5]. Impact of orthogonal initialization In the main paper, we have advocated and presented results for using a balanced LL-orthogonal initialization. Here, we discuss two special cases of orthogonal initialization (and their balanced versions): identity matrices that have also been used for GNNs in 2https://github.com/Diego999/pyGAT 20Table 6: Comparing a balanced LL-orthogonal initialization to Lipschitz normalization applied with a standard (imbalanced) Xavier initialization: the balanced initialization results in a much higher accuracy as the depth of the network increases.

In line with [18], identity and LLidentity are used to initialize the hidden layers while Xavier is used to initialize the first and last layers. A network initialized with identity is balanced by adjusting the weights of the first and last layer to have norm1 (as identity matrices have row-wise and column-wise norm). A network with LLidentity initialization is balanced to have norm 2 in the first and last layer, similar to LLortho initialization. We compare the performance using these four base initializations (one standard Xavier, and three orthogonal cases) and their balanced counterparts in Fig. 9. We observe that balancing an (LL-)orthogonal initialization results in an improvement in the general- ization ability of the network in most cases and speeds up training, particularly for deeper networks. However, note that an (LL-)orthogonal initialization itself also has a positive effect on trainability in particular of deep networks. Contributing to this fact is the mostly-balanced nature of an (LL- )orthogonal initialization i.e. given hidden layers of equal dimensions the network is balanced in all layers except the first and last layers (assuming zero attention parameters), which allows the model to train, as opposed to the more severely imbalanced standard Xavier initialization. This further enforces the key takeaway of our work that norm imbalance at initialization hampers the trainability of GATs. In addition, the LLortho+Bal initialization also speeds up training over the LLortho initialization even in cases in which the generalization performance of the model is at par for both initializations. Figure 9: GAT network with varying initialization trained using SGD. Note that identity initializations have also been explored in the context of standard feed-forward neural networks. While they tend to work in practice, the lack of induced feature diversity can be problematic from a theoretical point of view (see e.g. for a counter-example [7]). However, potentially due to the reasons regarding feature diversity and ReLU activation discussed above, the balanced looks-linear random orthogonal initialization (LLortho+Bal.) outperforms initialization with identity matrices (see Fig. 9). In most cases, the balanced versions outperform the imbalanced version of the base initialization and the performance gap becomes exceedingly large as network depth increases. 21Applicability to other MPGNNs As GAT is a generalization of the GCN, all theorems are also applicable to GCNs (where the attention parameters are simply0). We provide additional experiments in Table 7, comparing the performance of GCN models of varying depths with imbalanced and balanced initializations trained on Cora using the SGD optimizer. We use the same hyperparameters as reported for GAT. As expected, the trainability benefits of a balanced initialization are also evident in deeper GCN networks.

However, adapting the balanced initialization to different methods entails modification of the conservation law derived for GATs to correspond to the specific architecture of the other method. For example, the proposed balanced initialization can be applied directly to a more recent variant of GAT, ωGAT [18], for which the same conservation law holds and also benefits from a balanced initialization. We conduct additional experiments to verify this. The results in Fig. 10 follow a similar pattern as for GATs: a balanced orthogonal initialization with looks linear structure (LLortho+Bal) of ωGAT performs the best, particularly by a wide margin at much higher depths (64 and 80 layers). Figure 10: ωGAT network with varying trained on Cora. In this work, we focus our exposition on GATs and take the first step in modeling the training dynamics of attention-based models for graph learning. An intriguing direction for future work is to derive modifications in the conservation law for other attention-based models utilizing the dot-product self-attention mechanism such as SuperGAT [28] and other architectures based on Transformers[47], 22that are widely used in Large Language Models (LLMs) and have recently also been adapted for graph learning [58, 60]. 9 Datasets Summary We used nine benchmark datasets for the transductive node classification task in our experiments, as summarized in Table 8. For the Platenoid datasets (Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed) [56], we use the graphs provided by Pytorch Geometric (PyG), in which each link is saved as an undirected edge in both directions. However, the number of edges is not exactly double (for example, 5429 edges are reported in the raw Cora dataset, but the PyG dataset has 10556 < (2 × 5429)) edges as duplicate edges have been removed in preprocessing. We also remove isolated nodes in the Citeseer dataset. The WebKB (Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin), Wikipedia (Squirrel and Chameleon) and Actor datasets [39], are used from the replication package provided by [40], where duplicate edges are removed. All results in this paper are according to the dataset statistics reported in Table 8. Table 8: Summary of datasets used in experiments. Dataset Cora Cite. Pubmed Cham. Squi. Actor Corn.

The change distribution for the parameters in al is missing for l = 5and l ∈ [7, 10] because these parameters remain unchanged (see Fig.8). (b) L = 20: The same pattern as in L = 10is seen. However, the difference between the trainability of models with unbalanced and balanced initialization becomes even more prominent. No attention parameters change at all with standard Xavier initialization (and hence their change distribution is not visible in the plot). Figure 11: Distributions of the relative and absolute change in the values of feature transformation parameters Wl and attention parameters al, respectively, when trained using SGD with unbalanced (Xav. and Xav+ZeroAtt) and balanced (Xav+Bal and LLortho+Bal) initialization. The black markers in each standard box-whisker plot denote the mean. In general, larger changes occur in attention parameters at later layers closer to the output of the network, whereas feature parameters change more in the earlier layers at the input of the network. We observe this also from the perspective of relative gradients, as higher gradients cause higher parameter changes. 24(a) L = 5: test accuracy (left to right) is 71.6%, 76.2%, 77.3%, and 80.5%. (b) L = 10: test accuracy (left to right) is 63.2%, 68.8%, 71.8%, and 78.0%. Figure 12: Layer-wise relative gradient norms of GAT parameters trained with Adam, which in itself improves trainability over SGD, especially for L = 10(see Fig.4b) even with standard initialization. However, with a balanced initialization, the training is faster and the model also generalizes better, as evident from the significant margin in test accuracy. A general noticeable trend, particularly with balanced initialization, is that the attention parameters have higher gradients at the end of the network (and thus change more in the later layers (see Fig. 11)) whereas the feature parameters have high gradients at the start of the network. Also, it can be seen that the feature parameters begin to change a few epochs before the attention parameters change noticeably, while the attention parameters continue to change for a few more epochs after the gradients of feature parameters have dropped. We speculate a representational benefit could drive this behaviour, i.e. with depth, the learned representation of neighbors becomes increasingly informative for a node and thus leads to a higher activity of the attention mechanism. 25",

        "main_contributions": "This research investigates the optimization and learning dynamics of Graph Attention Networks (GATs), addressing the problem of severe performance degradation in deeper GATs with standard initialization. The main contributions include the derivation of a conservation law for GAT gradient flow dynamics, which explains why a significant portion of parameters in GATs with standard initialization fail to change during training, especially in deeper networks. To counter this, the study proposes a balanced initialization scheme that enables more effective gradient propagation, facilitates the training of deeper GATs, and achieves considerable speedup in training and convergence time. This work also establishes a causal link between parameter balancedness and trainability, laying a foundation for studying learning dynamics in positive homogeneous models with attention mechanisms.",
        "methodology": "The study employs a theoretical and empirical methodology. Theoretically, it derives a conservation law for GATs by extending the concept of neuron-wise balancedness from traditional deep neural networks, utilizing rescale invariance and positive homogeneity of activation functions (e.g., ReLU). This law quantifies the relationship between the L2-norms of incoming feature weights, attention weights, and outgoing feature weights for each neuron. Empirically, the research proposes a balanced initialization scheme (Procedure 2.6) where attention parameters are initialized to zero, and feature weights are scaled to satisfy the derived norm conservation, effectively setting the 'degree of balancedness' (c) to zero. Two variants are explored: Balanced Xavier (BalX) and Balanced Orthogonal (BalO) initialization, the latter incorporating a looks-linear orthogonal structure for feature weights to enhance dynamical isometry.",
        "experimental_setup": "Experiments were conducted on GATs, including comparisons with GCNs and ωGAT, across nine benchmark datasets for semi-supervised node classification: Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed (Platenoid), and Actor, Chameleon, Cornell, Squirrel, Texas, Wisconsin (heterophilic). Models were trained using both Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam optimizers for up to 5000 epochs, with specific learning rates adjusted for network depth. The evaluation involved comparing standard Xavier initialization (Xav) with balanced initialization schemes (BalX, BalO) and an ablation (XavZ - Xavier with zero attention). Architectural variations such as different activation functions (ReLU, ELU), multiple attention heads, weight sharing, and regularization techniques (dropout, weight decay) were also investigated. Performance was measured by mean test accuracy and epochs to the best model over five runs, along with visualizations of relative parameter change and relative gradient norms. Hardware used included Nvidia T4 Tensor Core GPU or Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU, with experiments implemented using the PyTorch Geometric framework. A comparison with Lipschitz Normalization for GNNs was also included.",
        "limitations": "The derived conservation law is specifically applicable only to the self-attention mechanisms found in the original GAT and GATv2 models, as well as architectural variations like ωGAT. It does not directly apply to different types of self-attention, such as dot-product self-attention, which would require modifications to the conservation law. The theoretical framework assumes positively homogeneous activation functions, which means non-homogeneous functions like ELU might negatively impact certain balanced initializations (e.g., BalO). The current exposition focuses on vanilla GATs to isolate the contribution of the initialization scheme, implying that the integration of elements like residual skip connections is not fully explored, although they are theoretically supported if their parameters are initialized to zero. Furthermore, the paper acknowledges that standard GNNs, including GAT, do not perform optimally on heterophilic datasets and does not aim to outperform specialized state-of-the-art models for these cases.",
        "future_research_directions": "Future research directions include extending the study of learning dynamics to other positive homogeneous models incorporating attention mechanisms, particularly Transformers and vision transformers, which often require greater depth. Another promising area is to explore how dynamical isometry can be achieved or better approximated in general Graph Neural Networks. Modifying and deriving new conservation laws for alternative attention-based models, such as SuperGAT, which utilizes dot-product self-attention, and other Transformer-based architectures applied to graph learning, is also suggested. Additionally, further investigation into the role of overparameterization in GNNs and its potential benefits for generalization performance, as observed with increased width in unbalanced models, could be a fruitful direction. A deeper understanding of fine-grained training dynamics beyond the coarse-level conservation law is also warranted.",

Introduction Graph neural networks (GNNs) (Gori et al., 2005) are a standard class of models for machine learning on graph- structured data that utilize node feature and graph struc- ture information jointly to achieve strong empirical per- formance, particularly on node classification tasks. In- put graphs to GNNs stem from various domains of real- world systems such as social (Bian et al., 2020), com- mercial (Zhang & Chen, 2020), academic (Hamaguchi et al., 2017), economic (Monken et al., 2021), biochem- ical(Kearnes et al., 2016), physical (Shlomi et al., 2021), and transport (Wu et al., 2019) networks that are diverse in their node feature and graph structure properties. 1CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, 66123 Saarbr¨ucken, Germany. Correspondence to: Nimrah Mustafa <nimrah.mustafa@cispa.de>. Proceedings of the 41 st International Conference on Machine Learning, Vienna, Austria. PMLR 235, 2024. Copyright 2024 by the author(s). The message-passing mechanism of GNNs (Kipf & Welling, 2017; Xu et al., 2019) involves two key steps: a transformation of the node features, and the aggregation of these transformed features from a node’s neighborhood to update the node’s representation during training. While this has proven to be largely successful in certain cases, it gen- erally introduces some problems for learning with GNNs, the most notorious of which is over-smoothing (Li et al., 2018). The enforced use of structural information in ad- dition to node features may be detrimental to learning the node classification task, as shown by recent results where state-of-the-art GNNs perform the same as or worse than multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) (Gomes et al., 2022; Yan et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2022). One such task is where node labels can be easily determined by informative node fea- tures and require no contribution from the neighborhood. Here, standard neighborhood aggregation, as in most GNN architectures, would impair model performance, particu- larly with an increase in model depth. A popular standard GNN architecture that, in principle, tries to resolve this problem is the Graph Attention Net- work (GAT) (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2018; Brody et al., 2022). By design, neighborhood aggregation in GATs is charac- terized by learnable coefficients intended to assign larger weights to more important neighboring nodes (including the node itself) in order to learn better node representations. Therefore, in the above example, GATs should ideally re- sort to assigning near-zero importance to neighbor nodes, effectively switching off neighborhood aggregation. How- ever, we find that, counter-intuitively, GATs are unable to do this in practice and continue to aggregate the uninforma- tive features in the neighborhood which impedes learning. One may ask why one would employ a GAT (or any GNN architecture) if an MLP suffices. In practice, we do not know whether neighborhood aggregation (of raw features or features transformed by a perceptron or MLP), would be beneficial or not beforehand. This raises a pertinent ques- tion for the GNN research community: How much neigh- borhood aggregation is needed for a given task? . Ideally, it is what we would want a model to learn. Otherwise, the right task-specific architecture would need to be identified by time and resource-intensive manual tuning. We address the challenge faced by GAT to effectively de- 1 arXiv:2406.00418v2  [cs.LG]  29 Jul 2024GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors termine how well a node is represented by its own features compared to the features of neighboring nodes, i.e., dis- tinguish between the relative importance of available node features and graph structure information for a given task. Firstly, we provide an intuitive explanation for the problem based on a conservation law of GAT gradient flow dynam- ics derived by Mustafa & Burkholz (2023). Building on this insight, we present GATE, an extension of the GAT architecture that can switch neighborhood aggregation on and off as necessary. This allows our proposed architecture to gain the following advantages over GAT: 1. It alleviates the notorious over-smoothing problem by addressing the root cause of unnecessarily repeated neighborhood aggregation. 2. It allows the model to benefit from more meaningful representations obtained solely by deeper non-linear transformations, similarly to perceptrons, in layers with little to no neighborhood aggregation. 3. It often outperforms GATs on real-world heterophilic datasets by weighing down unrelated neighbors. 4. It offers interpretable learned self-attention coeffi- cients, at the node level, that are indicative of the rel- ative importance of feature and structure information in the locality of the node. In order to validate these claims, we construct a syn- thetic test bed of two opposite types of learning problems for node classification where label-relevant information is completely present only in a node’s i) own features and ii) neighboring nodes’ features (see Fig. 2). GATE is able to adapt to both cases as necessary. On real-world datasets, GATE performs competitively on homophilic datasets and is substantially better than GAT on heterophilic datasets. Furthermore, up to our knowledge, it achieves a new state of the art on the relatively large OGB-arxiv dataset (Hu et al., 2021) (i.e., 79.57 ± 0.84% test accuracy). In sum- mary, our contributions are as follows: • We identify and experimentally demonstrate a struc- tural limitation of GAT, i.e., its inability to switch off neighborhood aggregation. • We propose GATE, an extension of GAT, that over- comes this limitation and, in doing so, unlocks several benefits of the architecture. • We update an existing conservation law relating the structure of gradients in GAT to GATE. • We construct a synthetic test bed to validate our claims, which could be of independent interest to mea- sure progress in developing adaptive neighborhood aggregation schemes. Figure 1: MLP only performs node feature transforma- tions, whereas GAT also always aggregates over the neigh- borhood. With the ability to switch off neighborhood ag- gregation, GATE can learn to emulate MLP behavior and potentially interleave effective perceptron and standard lay- ers in a flexible manner. This allows for more expressive power that we find to benefit real-world tasks (see Table 3). 2. Related Work To relieve GNNs from the drawbacks of unnecessarily re- peated neighborhood aggregation in deeper models, ini- tial techniques were inspired by classical deep learning of MLPs such as normalization (Cai et al., 2021; Zhao & Akoglu, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; 2021) and regularization (Papp et al., 2021; Rong et al., 2020; Yang et al., 202; Zou et al., 2019). More recently, the need for deeper models and architectural changes to limit neighborhood aggregation as necessary has been recognized. Some approaches use linear combi- nations of initial features and current layer representation (Gasteiger et al., 2019), add skip connections and identity mapping (Chen et al., 2020; Cong et al., 2021), combine representations of all previous layers at the last layer (Xu et al., 2018), aggregate information from a node-wise de- fined range of k-hop neighbors(Liu et al., 2020), and limit the number of aggregation iterations based on node influ- ence scores (Zhang et al., 2021). However, these architec- tures are not flexible enough to utilize additional network layers to simulate perceptron behavior, which, as we find, benefits heterophilic tasks. (Ma et al., 2023) discuss ‘good’ and ‘bad’ heterophily, which are also task-dependent. Other contemporary works for general GNNs propose the use of bilevel optimization to determine a node’s strategic discrete action to a received message (Finkelshtein et al., 2023) and a variational inference framework for adaptive message passing (Errica et al., 2023). While these non- attentive architectures improve message passing in GNNs, we focus on identifying and explaining a structural limita- tion of self-attention in GAT, that continues to be used as a strong baseline architecture. An orthogonal line of research uses graph structural learn- ing (Yang et al., 2019; Stretcu et al., 2019; Franceschi et al., 2020) to amend the input graph structure such that neighborhood aggregation benefits the given task. Such 2GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors approaches are difficult to scale, more susceptible to over- smoothing, and potentially destroy any inherent informa- tion in the original graph structure. On the contrary, a standard GNN architecture equipped to selectively per- form neighborhood aggregation avoids these pitfalls. Self- supervision of the attention mechanism has also been pro- posed (Wang et al., 2019; Kim & Oh, 2021). Methods such as graph rewiring (Deac et al., 2022) to overcome problems such as over-squashing (Alon & Yahav, 2021) are comple- mentary and may also be combined with GATE. While we focus our insights on GAT, architectures based on GAT such as ωGAT (Eliasof et al., 2023) also suffer from the same problem (see Fig. 14 in Appendix C). This further confirms that the universal problem with GAT has been correctly identified. In general, recent works direct ef- fort to understand the current limitations of graph attention (Lee et al., 2023; Fountoulakis et al., 2023). 3. Architecture Notation Consider a graph G = ( V, E) with node set V and edge set E ⊆ V × V, where for a node v ∈ V the neighborhood is N(v) = {u|(u, v) ∈ E} and input features are h0 v. A GNN layer updates each node’s repre- sentation by aggregating over its neighbors’ representation and combining it with its own features. The aggregation and combination steps can be performed together by in- troducing self-loops in G such that, ∀v ∈ V, (v, v) ∈ E. We assume the presence of self-loops in G unless spec- ified otherwise. In GATs, this aggregation is weighted by parameterized attention coefficients αuv, which indi- cate the importance of node u for v. A network is con- structed by stacking L layers, defined as follows, using a non-linear activation function ϕ that is homogeneous (i.e ϕ(x) = xϕ′(x)) and consequently, ϕ(ax) = aϕ(x) for positive scalars a) such as ReLU ϕ(x) = max {x, 0} or LeakyReLU ϕ(x) = max{x, 0} + −α max{−x, 0}. GAT Given input representations hl−1 v for v ∈ V, a GAT 1 layer l ∈ [L] transforms those to: hl v = ϕ   X u∈N(v) αl uv · Wl shl−1 u  , where (1) αl uv = exp \u0000 el uv \u0001 P u′∈N(v) exp \u0000 el u′v \u0001, and (2) el uv = \u0000 al\u0001⊤ · ϕ \u0000 Wl shl−1 u + Wl thl−1 v \u0001 (3) The feature transformation weights Ws and Wt for source and target nodes, respectively, may also be shared such that Ws = Wt. We denote this variant of GAT by GATS. 1Throughout, we refer to GATv2 (Brody et al., 2022) as GAT. GATE In addition, we propose GATE, a GAT variant that flexibly weights the importance of node features and neigh- borhood features. A GATE layer is also defined by Eq. (1) and (2) but modifies euv in Eq. (3) to Eq. (4). el uv = \u0000 1u̸=val s + 1u=val t \u0001⊤ ·ϕ \u0000 Ulhl−1 u + Vlhl−1 v \u0001 . (4) We denote euv in Eq. (3) and (4) as el vv if u = v. For GATE, Wl s in Eq. (1) is denoted as Wl. A weight- sharing variant of GATE, GATE S, is characterized by all feature transformation parameters being shared in a layer (i.e. Wl = Ul = Vl). Note that, then, for a d-dimensional layer, GATE adds onlyd more parameters to GAT. We next present theoretical insights into the reasoning be- hind the inability of GATs to switch off neighborhood ag- gregation, which is rooted in norm constraints imposed by the inherent conservation law for GATs. The gradients of GATE fulfill an updated conservation law (Thoerem 4.3) that enables switching off neighborhood aggregation in a parameter regime with well-trainable attention. 4. Theoretical Insights For simplicity, we limit our discussion here to GATs with weight sharing. We derive similar arguments for GATs without weight sharing in Appendix A.1. The following conservation law was recently derived for GATs to explain trainability issues of standard initialization schemes. Even with improved initializations, we argue that this law lim- its the effective expressiveness of GATs and their ability to switch off neighborhood aggregation when necessary. Theorem 4.1 (Thm. 2.2 by Mustafa & Burkholz (2023)) . The parameters θ of a layer l ∈ [L − 1] in a GAT network and their gradients ∇θL w.r.t. loss L fulfill: ⟨Wl [i,:], ∇Wl [i,:] ⟩ = ⟨Wl+1 [:,i] , ∇Wl+1 [:,i] ⟩ + ⟨al [i], ∇al [i] ⟩. (5) Intuitively, this equality limits the budget for the relative change of parameters and imposes indirectly a norm con- straint on the parameters. Under gradient flow that assumes infinitesimally small learning rates, this law implies that the relationship \r\rWl[i, :] \r\r2 − \r\ral[i] \r\r2 − \r\rWl+1[: i] \r\r2 = c stays constant during training, where c is defined by the initial norms. Other gradient-based optimizers fulfill this norm balance also approximately. Note that the norms\r\rWl[i, :] \r\r generally do not assume arbitrary values but are determined by the required scale of the output. Deeper models are especially less flexible in varying these norms as deviations could lead to exploding or diminishing out- puts and/or gradients. In consequence, the norms of the attention parameters are also bounded. Furthermore, a pa- rameter becomes harder to change during training when its 3GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors magnitude increases. This can be seen by transforming the law with respect to the relative change of a parameter de- fined as ∆θ = ∇θL/θ for θ ̸= 0 or ∆θ = 0 for θ = 0. nl+1X j=1 Wl ij 2 ∆Wl ij = nl+2X k=1 Wl+1 ki 2 ∆Wl+1 ki + al i 2 ∆al i. (6) The higher the magnitude of an attention parameter (al i)2, the smaller will be the relative change ∆al i and vice versa. This restricts the attention mechanism in the network to a less-trainable regime without converging to a meaningful model. We next explain why large \r\ral\r\r are required to switch off neighborhood aggregation in a layer. Insight 4.2 (Effective expressiveness of GATs). GATs are challenged to switch off neighborhood aggregation during training, as this requires the model to enter a less trainable regime with large attention parameters ∥a∥2 >> 1. An intuitive derivation of this insight is presented in the appendix. Here, we outline the main argument based on the observation that to make the contribution of neighbor j insignificant relative to node i, we require αij/αii << 1. We use relativeαij/αii instead of αij and αii to cancel out normalization constants and simplify the analysis. Our key observation is that, given an insignificant link (i, j), its relative contribution to its two neighborhoods αij/αii << 1 and αji/αjj << 1 are affected in oppo- site ways by a feature f of the attention parameters a, i.e. if a[f] contributes to reducing αij/αii, it automatically in- creases αji/αjj . However, we require multiple features that contribute to reducing only αij without strengthen- ing αji that may only be possible in a high dimensional space requiring large norms of a. Yet, the norms ∥a∥2 are constrained by the parameter initialization and cannot in- crease arbitrarily due to the derived conservation law. Note that to switch off all neighborhood aggregation, we require αij/αii << 1, ∀ j ∈ N(i), further complicating the task. To address this challenge, we modify the GAT architecture by GATE that learns separate attention parameters for the node and the neighborhood contribution. As its conserva- tion law indicates, it can switch off neighborhood aggrega- tion in the well-trainable parameter regime. Theorem 4.3 (Structure of GATE gradients). The param- eters and gradients of a GATE network w.r.t. to loss L for layer l ∈ [L − 1] are conserved according to the following laws. Given Θ(θ) = ⟨θ, ∇θL⟩, it holds that: Θ(Wl [i,:]) − Θ(al+1 s [i]) − Θ(al+1 t [i]) = Θ(Wl+1 [:,i] ). (7) and, if additional independent matrices Ul and Vl are trainable, it also holds that: Θ(al s[i]) + Θ(al t[i]) = Θ(Ul [i,:]) + Θ(Vl [i,:]). (8) The proof is provided in the appendix. We utilize this the- orem for two purposes. Firstly, it induces an initialization that enables at least the initial trainability of the network. Similarly to GAT (Mustafa & Burkholz, 2023), we initial- ize all a parameters with zero and matrices W with ran- dom orthogonal looks-linear structure in GATE. This also ensures that we have no initial inductive bias or preference for specific neighbor or node features. As an ablation, we also verify that the initialization of the attention parameters in GAT with zero alone can not switch off neighborhood aggregation in GAT (see Fig. 7 in Appendix C). Secondly, the conservation law leads to the insight that a GATE network is more easily capable of switching off neighborhood aggregation or node feature contributions in comparison with GAT. Insight 4.4 (GATE is able to switch off neighborhood ag- gregation.). GATE can flexibly switch off neighborhood aggregation or node features in the well-trainable regime of the attention parameters. This insight follows immediately from the related conser- vation law for GATE that shows that at and as can inter- change the available budget for relative change among each other. Furthermore, the contribution of neighbors and the nodes are controlled separately. We show how the respec- tive switch-off can be achieved with relatively small atten- tion parameter norms that correspond to the well-trainable regime in Appendix A.3. To verify these insights in exper- iments, we next design synthetic data generators that can test the ability of GNNs to take structural infromation into account in a task-appropriate manner. 5. Experiments We validate the ability of GATE to perform the appropri- ate amount of neighborhood aggregation, as relevant for the given task and input graph, on both synthetic and real- world graphs. In order to gauge the amount of neighbor- hood aggregation, we study the distribution of αvv values (over the nodes) at various epochs during training and lay- ers in the network. This serves as a fair proxy since ∀ v ∈ V, αvv = 1 − P u∈N(v),u̸=v αuv. Thus, αvv = 1 implies no neighborhood aggregation (i.e. only hv is used) whereas αvv = 0 implies only neighborhood aggregation (i.e. hv is not used). Figure 2 shows an exemplary con- struction of both these cases. We defer a discussion of the experimental setup to Appendix B. 5.1. Synthetic Test Bed We construct the synthetic test bed as a node classification task for two types of problems: self-sufficient learning and neighbor-dependent learning. In the self-sufficient learning problem, complete label-relevant information is present in 4GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors (a) No neighborhood contribution required. (b) Only neighborhood contribution required. Figure 2: Examples of synthetic input graphs constructed for learning tasks that are (a) self-sufficient and can be bet- ter solved by switching off neighborhood aggregation, i.e. αvv = 1 and (b) neighbor-dependent that benefit from ig- noring the node’s own features, i.e.αvv = 0. In both cases, ∀ v ∈ V, P u∈N(v),u̸=v αuv + αvv = 1. These represent opposite ends of the spectrum whereas real-world tasks of- ten lie in between and require αii ∈ [0, 1]. GATE’s atten- tion mechanism is more flexible than GAT’s in learning the level of neighborhood aggregation required for a task. a node’s own features. On the contrary, in the neighbor- dependent learning problem, label-relevant information is present in the node features of the k-hop neighbors. We discuss both cases in detail, beginning with the simpler one. Learning self-sufficient node labels In order to model this task exactly, we generate an Erd ˝os–R´enyi (ER) graph structure G with N = 1000 nodes and edge probabil- ity p = 0 .01. Node labels yv are assigned uniformly at random from C = [2 , 8] classes. Input node features h0 v are generated as one-hot encoded node labels in both cases, i.e., h0 v = 1yv . Nodes are divided randomly into train/validation/test split with a 2 : 1 : 1 ratio. We also use a real-world graph structure of the Cora dataset. Two cases using this graph structure are tested: i) using the original node labels consisting of7 classes, and ii) randomized labels of 7 classes. Input node features are generated as one-hot encoding of node labels in both cases. The standard splits of Cora are used. Table 1: Self-sufficient learning: S, Cand L denote graph structure, number of label classes, and number of net- work layers, respectively. Original (Orig.) and randomized (Rand.) labels are used for the Cora structure. In all cases, 100% train accuracy is achieved except in ones marked with ∗ and GATE eventually achieves 100% test accuracy a few epochs later except in one marked with ‡. GAT S and GAT models marked with † also eventually achieve 100% test accuracy. GATE S behaves similarly to GATE and achieves 100% train and test accuracy. . S C L Test Acc.@Epoch of Min.

In line with the homophilic nature of Cora, GAT achieves reasonably good accuracy when the original labels of the Cora graph structure are used as neighborhood aggregation is relatively less detrimental, particularly in a single-layer model. Nevertheless, in the same case, GATE generalizes better than GAT with an increase in model depth. This in- dicates that over-smoothing, a major cause of performance degradation with model depth in GNNs, is also alleviated due to reduced neighborhood aggregations (see Fig. 3). On the contrary, random labels pose a real challenge to GAT. Since the neighborhood features are fully uninforma- tive about a node’s label in the randomized case, aggrega- tion over such a neighborhood distorts the fully informa- tive features of the node itself. This impedes the GAT net- work from learning the task, as it is unable to effectively switch off aggregation (see Fig. 3), whereas GATE is able to adapt to the required level of neighborhood aggregation (i.e. none, in this case). Interestingly, note that a single 5GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors (a) GAT with original labels  (b) GAT with random labels (c) GATE with original labels  (d) GATE with random labels Figure 3: Distribution of αvv against training epoch for self-sufficient learning problem using Cora structure and input node features as the one-hot encoding of labels for 1 and 2 layer models. Due to space limitation, we defer the plots of 5 layer networks to Fig. 8 in Appendix C. layer GAT in the case of random labels can almost, though not completely, switch off neighborhood aggregation (see Fig. 3) and achieve (near) perfect accuracy in the simpler cases. This is in line with our theoretical analysis (see In- sight 4.2), as the norms of a single-layer model are not con- strained and thus the attention parameters have more free- dom to change. Overall, the accuracy of GAT worsens drastically along two dimensions simultaneously: i) an increase in the depth of the model (due to increased unnecessary aggregation), and ii) an increase in the complexity of the task (due to an in- crease in the number of classes in an ER graph and conse- quently in node neighborhoods). In the interest of space, we defer results for GATE S to Fig. 9 in Appendix C as aggregation patterns similar to GATE are observed. Having established that GATE excels GAT in avoiding task-irrelevant neighborhood aggregation, it is also impor- tant to verify whether GATE can perform task-relevant neighborhood aggregation when required, and as much as required. We answer this question next by studying the be- havior of GATE, in comparison to GAT, on a synthetically constructed neighbor-dependent learning problem. Learning neighbor-dependent node labels To model this task, we generate an ER graph structure with N = 1000 nodes and edge probability p = 0 .01. Input node features h0 v ∈ Rd are sampled from a multivariate normal distribution N(0d, Id). For simplicity, d = 2. This input graph G is fed to a random GAT network Mk with k layers of width d. Note that this input graph G has no self-loops on nodes (i.e. v /∈ N(v)).The parameters of Mk are initialized with the standard Xavier (Glorot & Ben- gio, 2010) initialization. Thus, for each node v, the node embedding output by Mk, hMk v is effectively a function f Table 2: Neighbor-dependent learning: k and L denote the number of aggregation steps of the random GAT used for label generation and the number of layers of the evaluated network, respectively. Mean test accuracy ±95% confi- dence interval over 5 runs is reported. In all cases, a GATE variant outperforms the GAT variants. We further analyze one experimental run in detail in Table 8 in Appendix C. k L GATS GAT GATE S GATE 1 1 93 .6±1.3 92 .3±1.3 96.4 ± 0.7 93.5±1.3 2 93 .5±0.7 92 .7±2.7 97.9 ± 0.8 94.6±2.1 3 88 .2±4.9 91 .8±3.4 92 .1±4.6 94.0 ± 1.5 2 2 90 .4±1.3 87 .7±1.6 93.8 ± 0.5 88.7±2.5 3 82 .2±4.5 88 .9±2.1 85 .8±2.5 93.4 ± 3.3 4 84 .0±5.0 83 .0±4.8 89.2 ± 2.3 87.8±2.4 3 3 84 .3±3.2 83 .8±2.7 87 .5±1.8 88.6 ± 2.0 4 71 .4±3.9 75 .9±7.6 89.2 ± 1.0 89.0±0.5 5 80 .2±4.8 83 .9±2.2 86 .1±0.8 87.8 ± 1.6 of the k-hop neighboring nodes of node v represented by a random GAT network. Let Nk(v) denote the set of k-hop neighbors of v and v /∈ Nk(v). Finally, we run K-means clustering on the neighborhood aggregated representation of nodes hMk v to divide nodes into C clusters. For simplicity, we set C = 2. This cluster- ing serves as the node labels (i.e. yv = argc∈[C](v ∈ c) for our node classification task. Thus, the label yv of a node v to be learned is highly dependent on the input features of the neighboring nodes h0 u ∈ Nk(v) rather than the node’s own input features h0 v. The generated input data and the real decision boundary for varying k are shown in Fig. 4. Corresponding results in Table 2 and Fig. 5 exhibit that GATE can better detect the amount of necessary neighborhood aggregation than GAT. However, this task is more challenging than the previous one, and GATE too can not achieve perfect100% test accu- racy. This could be attributed to data points close to the real decision boundary which is not crisply defined (see Fig. 4). 5.2. Real-World Data To demonstrate that the ability of GATE to switch-off neighborhood aggregation has real application relevance, we evaluate GATE on relatively large-scale real-world node classification tasks, namely on five heterophilic benchmark datasets (Platonov et al., 2023) (see Table 3) and three OGB datasets (Hu et al., 2021) (see Table 5). We defer results and discussion on five small-scale datasets with varying homophily levels to Table 7 in Appendix C. To analyze 6GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors (a) k = 1  (b) k = 2  (c) k = 3 Figure 4: (a)-(c): Distribution of node labels of a synthetic dataset, with neighbor-dependent node labels, based on nodes’ own random features (left) and neighbors’ features aggregated k times (right).

Columns (left to right): 3, 4, and 5 layer models. While GAT is unable to switch off neighborhood aggregation in any layer, only 3 layers of the 4 and 5 layer models perform neighborhood aggregation. the potential benefits of combining MLP and GAT layers in GATE, we compare its behavior with GAT and MLP. We argue that the better performance of GATE, by a large margin in most cases, can be attributed to down-weighting unrelated neighbors, leveraging deeper non-linear feature transformations, and reducing over-smoothing. While we focus our exposition on the neighborhood aggre- gation perspective of GATs, we also consider the FAGCN architecture (Bo et al., 2021), which relies on a similar at- tention mechanism and, in theory, could switch off neigh- borhood aggregation when positive and negative contribu- tions of neighbors cancel out. In contrast to GATE, it re- quires tuning a hyperparameter ϵ, which controls the con- tribution of raw node features to each layer. Furthermore, on our synthetic tasks, we find that, like GAT, FAGCN is also unable to limit neighborhood contribution. We also provide a detailed qualitative and quantitative discussion comparing GATE and FAGCN using the synthetic testbed in Appendix C. Next, we analyze GATE’s ability to mix MLP and GAT layers. To this end, we evaluate a GNN architecture con- structed by alternately placing GAT and MLP layers in the network that we denote by MLP +GAT on various het- erophilic tasks. The purpose of this experiment is twofold. Firstly, we observe in Table 3 that MLP+GAT outperforms both GAT and MLP in most cases. This highlights the benefit of only performing non-linear transformations on raw or aggregated neighborhood features without immedi- ate further neighborhood aggregation to learn potentially more complex features. Secondly, we find GATE to outper- form MLP+GAT (see Table 3). This illustrates that rigidly embedding MLP layers in a GNN with arbitrary predefined roles is not ideal as the appropriate degree and placement of neighborhood aggregation is unknown a-priori. In con- trast, GATE offers more flexibility to learn intricate com- binations of GNN layers and nonlinear feature transforma- tions that define more adequate models for a given task, as exemplified in Fig. 6. The distributions ofαvv in Fig. 6 across layers in GATE re- veal information about the relative importance of node fea- ture and graph structure at the node level, which allows us to analyze the question to which degree graph information is helpful for a task. For example, in Fig. 6, we observe that the αvv values are mostly lower in the minesweeper dataset than the roman-empire dataset. This indicates that aggregation, particularly over the input node features and the final layer’s learned representations, is more beneficial compared to the node’s own features for the minesweeper dataset. On the other hand, for roman-empire, the model has a higher preference to utilize features of the node it- self (as most values of αvv approach 1) over features of the neighbors. This aligns with the homophily levels, 0.05 and 0.68, of the roman-empire and minesweeper datasets, re- spectively. A similar analysis for datasets Texas and Actor can be found in Fig. 13 in Appendix C. We also observe in Fig. 6 that when neighborhood aggrega- 7GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors Table 3: We report mean test accuracy ±95% confidence interval for roman-empire and amazon-ratings and AUC-ROC for the other three datasets over the standard 10 splits, following (Platonov et al., 2023). All architectures were run with networks of depth 5 and 10 layers. The better performance for each architecture is shown with the number of network layers used in parentheses.

Figure 6: Distribution of αvv against training epoch for a run of 5 layer networks on real-world heterophilic tasks. As ex- pected, GAT is unable to significantly vary neighborhood aggregation whereas GATE exhibits varying aggregation patterns across layers and tasks. These could be interpreted to indicate the inherent importance of raw node features relative to their neighborhoods for a given task. We defer the plots of the 10-layer models for tolokers dataset to Fig. 11 in Appendix C. tion takes place, the level of aggregation across all nodes, as indicated by the shape of αvv distribution, varies over network layers. This is expected as different nodes need different levels of aggregation depending on where they are situated in the graph topology. For example, peripheral nodes would require more aggregation than central nodes to obtain a similar amount of information. Therefore, as already observed with purposefully constructed synthetic data, GATE offers a more interpretable model than GAT in a real-world setting. While we focus our evaluation in Table 3 on comparison with the most relevant baselines such as attention-based ar- chitectures, we next present a more extensive comparison with 14 other baseline architectures in Table 4. For the re- sults reported in Table 3, we conduct experiments in a sim- ple setting without additional elements that may impact the performance such as skip connections, normalization, etc., to isolate the effect of the architecture and evaluate solely the impact of GATE’s ability to switch off neighborhood aggregation on real-world data. However, for the results in Table 4, we adopt the original codebase of (Platonov et al., 2023), which utilizes such elements to evaluate the performance of baseline GNNs and architectures specifi- cally designed for heterophilic datasets. We evaluate GATE in the same settings optimized for their experiments. For easy comparison, we replicate their results from Table 4 in (Platonov et al., 2023). We observe in Table 4 that while GATE outperforms GAT (and other baselines) significantly, GATE has comparable performance to GAT-sep, a variant of GAT, despite GATE being more parameter efficient by an order of magnitude. More specifically, GAT-sep and GATE introduce d2 and d additional parameters, respectively, in a layer. By corre- spondingly adapting GATE, we find GATE-sep to achieve the best performance in most cases. Therefore, additional techniques generally employed to boost performance are compatible and complementary to GATE. GATE’s ability to benefit from depth in terms of generaliza- tion is demonstrated on OGB datasets (see Table 5).

While the better performance of deeper models with limited neighborhood aggregation in certain layers indi- cates reduced over-smoothing, we also verify this insight quantitatively (see Table 9 in Appendix C). Our experimental code is available at https:// github.com/RelationalML/GATE.git. 6. Conclusion We experimentally illustrate a structural limitation of GAT that disables the architecture, in practice, to switch off task- irrelevant neighborhood aggregation. This obstructs GAT from achieving its intended potential. Based on insights from an existing conservation law of gradient flow dynam- ics in GAT, we have explained the source of this problem. To verify that we have identified the correct issue, we re- solve it with a modification of GAT, which we call GATE, and derive the corresponding modified conservation law. GATE holds multiple advantages over GAT, as it can lever- age the benefits of depth as in MLPs, offer interpretable, learned self-attention coefficients, and adapt the model to the necessary degree of neighborhood aggregation for a given task. We verify this on multiple synthetic and real- world tasks, where GATE significantly outperforms GAT and also achieves a new SOTA test accuracy on the OGB- arxiv dataset. Therefore, we argue that GATE is a suitable candidate to answer highly debated questions related to the importance of a given graph structure for standard tasks. 9GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors Acknowledgements We gratefully acknowledge funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the Horizon Europe Framework Programme (HORIZON) for proposal number 101116395 SPARSE-ML.

GATs are challenged to switch off neighborhood aggregation during training, as this would require the model to enter a less trainable regime with large attention parameters ∥a∥2 >> 1. We have to distinguish GATs with and without weight sharing in our analysis. GATs with weight sharing: To investigate the ability of a GAT to switch off neighborhood aggregation, let us focus on a link(i, j) that should neither contribute to the feature transformation of i nor j. This implies that we need to find attention parameters a (and potentially feature transformations W) so that αij/αii << 1 with αij/αii = exp ( eij − eii). This implies that we require eij − eii << 0 and thus aT ϕ (W (hi + hj)) − 2aT ϕ (W (hi)) << 0. Since we also require αij/αjj << 1, it follows from adding both inequalities that aT [ϕ (W (hi + hj)) − (ϕ (Whi) + ϕ (Whj))] << 0. This inequality can only be fulfilled if there exists at least one feature f for which ∆fij ; = a[f] [ϕ (W[f, :] (hi + hj)) − (ϕ (W[f, :]hi) + ϕ (W[f, :]hi))] fulfills ∆fij << 0. Yet, note that if both ϕ (W[f, :]hi) and ϕ (W[f, :]hj) are positive or both are negative, we just get ∆fij = 0 because of the definition of a LeakyReLU. Thus, there must exist at least one feature f so that without loss of generality ϕ (W[f, :]hi) < 0 and ϕ (W[f, :]hj) > 0. It follows that if a[f] > 0 that 0 > a[f]ϕ (W[f, :]hi) >> a[f] (ϕ (W[f, :] (hi + hj)) − ϕ (W[f, :]hj)) > a[f] (ϕ (W[f, :] (hi + hj)) − 2ϕ (W[f, :]hj)) also receives a negative contribution that makes αij/αjj smaller. Yet, what happens to αij/αii? By distinguishing two cases, namely W[f, :] (hi + hj) > 0 or W[f, :] (hi + hj) < 0 and computing a[f] [ϕ (W (hi + hj)) − 2ϕ (W[f, :]hj)] > 0 we find the feature contribution to be positive. If a[f] < 0, then 0 > a[f]ϕ (W[f, :]hj) >> a[f] (ϕ (W[f, :] (hi + hj)) − ϕ (W[f, :]hi)) > a[f] (ϕ (W[f, :] (hi + hj)) − 2ϕ (W[f, :]hi)) and αij/αjj is reduced. Similarly, we can derive that at the same time αij/αii is increased, however. This implies that any feature that contributes to reducing ∆fij automatically increases one feature while it increases another. We therefore need multiple featuresf to contribute to reducing either αij/αii or αij/αjj to compensate for other increases. This implies, in order to switch off neighborhood aggregation, we would need a high dimensional space of features that cater to switching off specific links without strengthening others. Furthermore, they would need large absolute values of a[f] and norms of W[f, :] or exploding feature vectors h to achieve this. Yet, all these norms are constrained by the derived conservation law and therefore prevent learning a representation that switches off full neighborhoods. GATs without weight sharing: The flow of argumentation without weight sharing is very similar to the one above with weight sharing. Yet, we have to distinguish more cases. 13GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors Similarly to before, we require αij/αjj << 1 and αji/αii << 1. It follows from adding both related inequalities that aT [ϕ (Wshi + Wthj) + ϕ (Wshj + Wthi) − ϕ ((Ws + Wt) hi) − ϕ ((Ws + Wt) hj)] << 0. This implies that for at least one feature f, we require a[f][ϕ \u0000 Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj \u0001 + ϕ \u0000 Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi \u0001 − ϕ ((Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hi) − ϕ ((Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj)] << 0. (9) Again, our goal is to show that this feature automatically decreases the contribution of one feature while it increases another. As argued above, switching off neighborhood aggregation would therefore need a high dimensional space of features that cater to switching off specific links without strengthening others. Furthermore, they would need large absolute values of a[f] and norms of W[f, :] or exploding feature vectors h to achieve this. Our derived norm constraints, however, prevent learning such a model representation. Concretely, without loss of generality, we therefore have to show that if a[f][ϕ \u0000 Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj \u0001 − ϕ \u0000\u0000 Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :] \u0001 hj \u0001 < 0, (10) at the same time, we receive a[f][ϕ \u0000 Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi \u0001 − ϕ \u0000\u0000 Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :] \u0001 hi \u0001 > 0, (11) (or vice versa). In principle, we have to show this for 16 different cases of pre-activation sign configurations for the four terms in Eq. (9). Yet, since the argument is symmetric with respect to exchanging i and j, only 8 different cases remain. Two trivial cases are identical signs for all four terms. These are excluded, as the left hand side (LHS) of Eq. (9) would become zero and thus not contribute to our goal to switch off neighborhood aggregation. In the following, we will discuss the remaining six cases. Please note that for the remainder of this derivation α >0 denotes the slope of the leakyReLU and not the attention weights αij. 1. Case (+ − ++): Let us assume that Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj > 0, Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi < 0, (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hi > 0, and (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj > 0. From this assumption and the fact that ϕ is a leakyReLU it follows that the LHS of Eq. (9) be- comes: a[f][ϕ \u0000 Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj \u0001 + ϕ \u0000 Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi \u0001 − ϕ \u0000\u0000 Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :] \u0001 hi \u0001 − ϕ \u0000\u0000 Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :] \u0001 hj \u0001 ] = a[f](α −1)[Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi]. Since α −1 < 0 and [Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, : ]hi] < 0 according to our assumption, Eq. (9) demands a[f] < 0. To switch off neighborhood aggregation, we would need to be able to make the LHS of Eq. (10) and Eq. (11) Eq. (11) negative. Yet, a negative a[f] leads to a positive LHS of Eq. (11). Thus, the assumed sign configuration cannot support switching off neighborhood aggregation. 2. Case (+ − −−): Let us assume that Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj > 0, Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi < 0, (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hi < 0, and (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj < 0. The LHS of Eq. (9) becomes a[f](1 −α)[Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj], which demands a[f] < 0. Accordingly, the LHS of Eq. (10) is clearly negative, while the LHS of Eq. (11) is a[f]αWs[f, :](hj − hi) > 0. The last inequality follows from our assumptions that implyWs[f, :]hj < Ws[f, :]hi by combining the assumptions (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj < 0 and Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj > 0. Again, this result implies that the considered sign configuration does not support switching off neighborhood aggregation. 3. Case (+ + + −): Let us assume that Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj > 0, Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi > 0, (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hi > 0, and (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj < 0. The LHS of Eq. (9) becomes a[f](1 −α)[Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hj], which demands a[f] > 0. Accordingly, the LHS of Eq. (10) becomes positive, which hampers switching-off neighborhood aggregation as discussed. 14GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors 4. Case (− − −+): Let us assume that Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj < 0, Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi < 0, (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hi < 0, and (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj > 0. The LHS of Eq. (9) becomes a[f](α −1)[Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hj], which demands a[f] > 0. Accordingly, the LHS of Eq. (10) becomes clearly negative. However, the LHS of Eq. (11) is positive, asa[f]αWs[f, :](hj − hi) > 0. The last inequality follows from our assumptions that imply Ws[f, :]hj > Ws[f, :]hi by combining the assumptions (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj > 0 and Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj < 0. Again, this analysis implies that the considered sign configuration does not support switching off neighborhood aggregation. 5. Case (+ − +−): Let us assume that Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj > 0, Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi < 0, (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hi > 0, and (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj < 0. According to our assumptions the LHS of Eq. (10) can only be negative if a[f] < 0. Yet, the LHS of Eq. (11) can only be negative if a[f] > 0. Thus, this case clearly cannot contribute to switching off neighborhood aggregation. 6. Case (+ − −+): Let us assume that Ws[f, :]hi + Wt[f, :]hj > 0, Ws[f, :]hj + Wt[f, :]hi < 0, (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hi < 0, and (Ws[f, :] + Wt[f, :]) hj > 0. Eq. (9) becomes a[f](1 − α)Ws[f, :] (hi − hj) < 0. At the same time, the LHS of Eq. (10) simplifies to a[f]Ws[f, : ](hi − hj) and the LHS of Eq. (11) is a[f]αWs[f, :](hj − hi) > 0. Hence, a negative Eq. (9) leads to a positive Eq. (11). Accordingly, the last possible sign configuration also does not support switching off neighborhood aggregation, which concludes our derivation. A.2. Proof of Theorem 4.3 Statement (Restated Theorem 4.3). The gradients and parameters of GATE for layer l ∈ [L − 1] are conserved according to the following laws: ⟨Wl[i, :], ∇Wl[i,:]L⟩ = ⟨Wl+1[:, i], ∇Wl+1[:,i]L⟩ + ⟨al+1 s [i], ∇al+1 s [i]L⟩ + ⟨al+1 t [i], ∇al+1 t [i]L⟩. (12) and, if additional independent matrices Ul and Vl are trainable, it also holds ⟨al s[i], ∇als[i]L⟩ + ⟨al t[i], ∇al t[i]L⟩ = ⟨Ul[i, :], ∇Ul[i,:]L⟩ + ⟨V l[i, :], ∇V l[i,:]L⟩. (13) The proof is analogous to the derivation of Theorem 2.2 by (Mustafa & Burkholz, 2023) that is restated in this work as Theorem 4.1. For ease, we replicate their notation and definitions here. Statement (Rescale invariance: Def 5.1 by Mustafa & Burkholz (2023)). The loss L(θ) is rescale-invariant with respect to disjoint subsets of the parametersθ1 and θ2 if for everyλ >0 we haveL(θ) = L((λθ1, λ−1θ2, θd)), where θ = (θ1, θ2, θd). Statement (Gradient structure due to rescale invariance Lemma 5.2 in (Mustafa & Burkholz, 2023)). The rescale invariance of L enforces the following geometric constraint on the gradients of the loss with respect to its parameters: ⟨θ1, ∇θ1L⟩ − ⟨θ2, ∇θ2L⟩ = 0. (14) We first consider the simpler case of GATES, i.e. W = U = V Theorem A.1 (Structure of GATES gradients). The gradients and parameters of GATES for layer l ∈ [L−1] are conserved according to the following laws: ⟨Wl[i, :], ∇Wl[i,:]L⟩ = ⟨Wl+1[:, i], ∇Wl+1[:,i]L⟩ + ⟨al s[i], ∇als[i]L⟩ + ⟨al t[i], ∇al t[i]L⟩. (15) Following a similar strategy to (Mustafa & Burkholz, 2023), we identify rescale invariances for every neuron i at layer l that induce the stated gradient structure. Given the following definition of disjoint subsets θ1 and θ2 of the parameter set θ, associated with neuron i in layer l, 15GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors θ1 = {x|x ∈ Wl[i, :]} θ2 = {w|w ∈ Wl+1[:, i]} ∪ {al s[i]} ∪ {al t[i]} We show that the loss of GATES remains invariant for any λ >0. The only components of the network that potentially change under rescaling are hl u[i], hl+1 v [j], and αl uv. The scaled network parameters are denoted with a tilde as ˜as l[i] = λ−1al s[i], ˜at l[i] = λ−1al t[i], and ˜Wl[i, j] = λWl[i, j], and the corresponding networks components scaled as a result are denoted by ˜hl u[i], ˜hl+1 v [k], and ˜αl uv. We show that the parameters of upper layers remain unaffected, as ˜hl+1 v [k] coincides with its original non-scaled variant ˜hl+1 v [k] = hl+1 v [k]. Also recall Eq. (4) for W = U = V as: el uv = ((1 − quv)al s + (quv)al t)⊤ · ϕ(Wlhl−1 u + Wlhl−1 v ) where quv = 1 if u = v and quv = 0 if u ̸= v. For simplicity, we rewrite this as: el uv,u̸=v = (al s)⊤ · ϕ(Wlhl−1 u + Wlhl−1 v ) (16) el uv,u=v = (al t)⊤ · ϕ(Wlhl−1 u + Wlhl−1 v ) (17) We show that ˜αl uv = exp(˜el uv)P u′∈N(v) exp(˜eluv) = αl uv , because (18) ˜el uv,u̸=v = el uv,u̸=v , and ˜el uv,u=v = el uv,u=v (19) which follows from the positive homogeneity of ϕ that allows ˜el uv,u=v = λ−1al s[i]ϕ( nl−1X j λWl[i, j](hl−1 u [j] + hl−1 v [j]) + nlX i′̸=i al s[i′]ϕ( nl−1X j Wl[i′, j](hl−1 u [j] + hl−1 v [j]) (20) = λ−1λal s[i]ϕ( nl−1X j Wl[i, j](hl−1 u [j] + hl−1 v [j]) + nlX i′̸=i al s[i′]ϕ( nl−1X j Wl[i′, j](hl−1 u [j] + hl−1 v [j]) (21) = el uv,u̸=v. (22) and similarly, 16GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors ˜el uv,u=v = λ−1al t[i]ϕ( nl−1X j λWl[i, j](hl−1 u [j] + hl−1 v [j]) + nlX i′̸=i al t[i′]ϕ( nl−1X j Wl[i′, j](hl−1 u [j] + hl−1 v [j]) (23) = λ−1λal t[i]ϕ( nl−1X j Wl[i, j](hl−1 u [j] + hl−1 v [j]) + nlX i′̸=i al t[i′]ϕ( nl−1X j Wl[i′, j](hl−1 u [j] + hl−1 v [j]) (24) = el uv,u=v. (25) Since ˜αl uv = αl uv, it follows that ˜hu l [i] = ϕ1   X z∈N(u) αl zu nl−1X j λWl[i, j]hl−1 z [j]   = λϕ1   X z∈N(u) αl zu nl−1X j Wl[i, j]hl−1 z [j]   = λhl u[i]. In the next layer, we therefore have ˜hl+1 v [k] = ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i λ−1Wl+1[k, i]˜hl u[i]   = ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i λ−1Wl+1[k, i]λhl u[i]   = ϕ1   X u∈N(v) αl+1 uv nlX i Wl+1[k, i]hl u[i]   = hl+1 v [k]. Thus, the output node representations of the network remain unchanged, and the loss L is rescale-invariant. Next consider the case that Wl, Ul, and V l are independent matrices. Similarly to the previous reasoning, we see that if we scale ˜Wl[i, :] = Wl[i, :]λ, then also scaling ˜Wl+1[:, i] = Wl+1[:, i]λ−1 and ˜al+1 s [i] = al+1 s [i]λ−1 and ˜al+1 t [i] = al+1 t [i]λ−1 will keep the GATE layer unaltered. In this case, we obtain an additional rescaling relationship between al s, al t and Ul, V l. A rescaling of the form ˜as l[i] = λ−1al s[i], ˜at l[i] = λ−1al t[i] could be compensated by ˜Ul[i, :] = Ul[i, :]λ and ˜V l[i, :] = V l[i, :]λ. It follows immediately that ˜euv = euv. A.3. Derivation of Insight 4.4 Following the analysis in A.1, in contrast to GAT, αij/αii << 1 can be easily realized in GATE with as[f] < 0 and at[f] > 0 for all or only a subset of the features. Note that for the non-weight-sharing case, U and V in GATE would simply correspond to Ws and Wt, respectively, in GATE and the same line of reasoning holds. Large norms are usually not required to create a notable difference in size between eii and eij. 17GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors B. Experimental Settings Our complete experimental setup is described as follows. Non-linearity For GATS and GAT networks, we substitute ϕ in Eq. (3) with LeakyReLU as defined in the standard architecture. For GATE, we substitute ϕ in Eq. (4) with ReLU in order to be able to interpret the sign of as and at parameters as contributing positively or negatively to neighborhood aggregation. MLP, MLP +GAT , and FAGCN also all use ReLU after every hidden layer. Network Width We vary the depth of GAT and GATE networks in all our experiments as specified. For synthetic datasets, the network width is fixed to 64 in all cases. For OGB datasets, we use the hidden dimensions used by (Brody et al., 2022). For the remaining datasets, the network width is also fixed to 64. Initialization The feature transformation parameter matrices, i.e.,W, U, and V are initialized randomly with an orthog- onal looks-linear structure (Burkholz & Dubatovka, 2019) for MLP, MLP+GAT , GAT(S) and GATE(S). The parameters a in GAT(S) use Xavier initialization (Glorot & Bengio, 2010), as is the standard. In GATE(S), as and at are initialized to 0 to initially give equal weights to the features of a node itself and its neighboring nodes. Optimization Synthetic, OGB, and remaining real-world tasks are run for a maximum of 10000, 2000, 5000 epochs, respectively, using the Adam optimizer. To isolate the effect of the architecture and study the parameter dynamics during training as best as possible, we do not use any additional elements such as weight decay and dropout regularization. We also do not perform any hyperparameter optimization. However, the learning rate is adjusted for different real-world datasets to enable stable training of models as specified in Table 6. Nevertheless, for a fair comparison, the same learning rate is used for a given problem across all architectures. For all synthetic data, a learning rate of 0.005 is used. Real-world datasets use their standard train/test/validation splits, i.e. those provided by Pytorch Geometric for Planetoid datasets Cora and Citeseer, by OGB framework for OGB datasets, and by (Platonov et al., 2023) for all remaining real-world datasets.

Additional Results Smaller Real-World Datasets We evaluate GAT and GATE on five small-scale real-world datasets with varying ho- mophily levels β as defined in (Pei et al., 2020) and report results in Table 7. Higher values ofβ indicate higher homophily, i.e. similar nodes (with the same label) tend to be connected. We note that a 2-layer network of a baseline method for het- erophilic datasets, Geom-GCN (Pei et al., 2020), attains test accuracy (%) of64.1, 67.6, and 31.6 for Wisconsin, Texas, and Actor datasets, respectively, which is in line with that achieved by GATE. Except for Citeseer, the best overall performance for each dataset is achieved on a shallow model. This is not surprising as these datasets are small-scale and potentially prone to over-fitting in large models, particularly since we do not use any skip connections or regularization to retain model performance. Furthermore, the three heterophilic datasets have been recently shown to be problematic (Platonov et al., 2023). Therefore, a better evaluation of GATE is on relatively large-scale OGB datasets (Hu et al., 2021) and more recent heterophilic datasets (Platonov et al., 2023) that can exploit the flexibility of GATE. Although GATE is more pa- rameterized than GAT, it usually requires fewer training epochs and generalizes better, in addition to other advantages over GAT as discussed in the paper.

Left to right: 1, 2, and 5 layer GATES models that all 100% test accuracy except in the case of 5 layer model using original labels. In this case, although a training accuracy if 100% is achieved at 32 epochs with test accuracy 97.3%, a maximum test accuracy of 98.4% is reached at 7257 epochs. Training the model to run to 15000 epochs only increases it to 98.4%. An increased learning rate did not improve this case. However, we also run the GAT model for 15000 epochs for this case, and it achieves 85.9% test accuracy at epoch 47 where the model achieves 100% accuracy and only achieves a maximum test accuracy of 89.3% briefly at epoch 8. 20GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors Figure 10: Distribution of αvv against training epoch for the neighbor-dependent learning problem withk = 1. Rows: GAT (top) and GATE (bottom) architecture. Columns (left to right): 1, 2, and 3 layer models.

This provides an insight into how similar the function represented by the trained model is to the function used to generate node labels, i.e. whether the model is simply overfitting to the train data or really learning the task. Higher training and test accuracy simultaneously indicate better learning.

Figure 12: Distribution of αvv against training epoch of 2-layer (left) and 5-layer (right) GAT networks for heterophilic datasets Texas (top) and Actor (bottom) 2-layer modes. Despite having connections to unrelated neighbors, GAT is unable to switch off neighborhood aggregation. Figure 13: Distribution of αvv, against training epoch of 2-layer (left) and 5-layer (right) GATE networks for heterophilic datasets Texas (top) and Actor (bottom), across layers could be interpreted to indicate the inherent importance of raw node features relative to their neighborhoods. For instance, in the case of Texas, GATE carries out little to no neighborhood aggregation in the first layer over input node features. Instead, aggregation is mainly done over node features transformed in earlier layers that effectuate non-linear feature learning as in perceptrons. However, in the case of Actor, GATE prefers most of the neighborhood aggregation to occur over the input node features, indicating that they are more informative for the task at hand. 22GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors Over-smoothing analysis In the main paper, we have already established the superior performance of GATE, compared to GAT, on several tasks. Intuitively, this can partially be attributed to reduced over-smoothing as its root cause, unnecessary neighborhood aggregation, is alleviated. Here, we verify this insight quantitatively. A widely accepted measure of over-smoothing is the Dirichlet energy (DE) (Cai & Wang, 2020). However, Eliasof et al. (2023) propose a modification of DE to measure GAT energy EGAT , that we use to evaluate over-smoothing in our experiments (see Table 9). We note that the notion of ‘over-smoothing’ is itself task-dependent. It is difficult to determine the optimal degree of smoothing for a task and the threshold that determines ‘over’-smoothing. This merits an in-depth analysis and curation of task-dependent smoothness measures that are not our focus. To show that GATE reduced over- smoothing relative to GAT, it suffices that a decrease in smoothing and an increase in accuracy occur simultaneously. Table 9: The measures Einput, EGAT and EGATE denote the smoothness of input node features, node features at the last layer L of the trained GAT and GATE models, respectively. Two cases are considered: All node pairs and only adjacent node pairs to measure smoothing at the global graph and local node level. Higher values indicate less smoothing. Node representations learned by GATE achieve higher test accuracy on all these tasks, as reported in the main paper, and are simultaneously less smooth than GAT in most cases, indicating that GATE potentially alleviates over-smoothing in GATs.

However, they are less flexible in assigning different importance to neighbors, suffer from over-smoothing, or come at the cost of an increased parameter count by increasing the size of the hidden dimensions (e.g. via a concatena- tion operation). We evaluate the performance of three such architectures that, in principle, employ different aggregation methods, which are likely to be capable of switching off neighborhood aggregation, on synthetic datasets empirically and discuss their ability or inability to switch off neighborhood aggregation qualitatively as follows. 1. ωGAT (Eliasof et al., 2023) introduces an additional feature-wise layer parameter ω that can, in principle, switch off neighborhood aggregation by setting ω parameters to 0, in addition to the attention mechanism based on GAT. How- ever, in practice, as we verify on our synthetic dataset in Figure 14, it is unable to effectively switch off neighborhood aggregation. Although it outperforms GAT, it is still substantially worse than GATE, especially for the deeper model due to unnecessary neighborhood aggregations. Another architecture based on graph attention, superGAT(Kim & Oh, 2021), falls under the paradigm of structural learning as it uses a self-supervised attention mechanism essentially for link prediction between nodes, and therefore its comparison with GATE is infeasible. 2. GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2018) uses the concatenation operation to combine the node’s own representation with the aggregated neighborhood representation. Therefore, it is usually (but not always) able to switch off the neigh- borhood aggregation for the synthetic datasets designed for the self-sufficient learning task (see Table 10). Mostly, GATE performs better on the neighbor-dependent task, in particular for deeper models, where the performance of GraphSAGE drops likely due to over-smoothing (see Table 11). 3. FAGCN (Bo et al., 2021) requires a slightly more detailed analysis. Authors of FAGCN state in the paper that: ‘When αG ij ≈ 0, the contributions of neighbors will be limited, so the raw features will dominate the node representations.’ where αG ij defined in the paper can be considered analogous to αij in GAT, though they are defined differently. Thus, from an expressivity point of view, FAGCN should be able to assign parameters such that all αG ij = 0. However, we empirically observe on synthetic datasets designed for the self-sufficient learning task, values of αG ij do not, in fact, approach zero. Despite being unable to switch off neighborhood aggregation, FAGCN, in its default implementation, achieves 100% test accuracy on the task. We discover this is so because FAGCN introduces direct skip connections of non-linearly transformed raw node features to every hidden layer. Given the simplicity of the one-hot encoded features in the datasets and the complete dependence of the label on these features, FAGCN is able to represent the desired function. In order to better judge its ability to switch off neighborhood aggregation by setting αG ij = 0, we remove this skip connection. From an expressivity point of view, FAGCN should still be able to achieve 100% test accuracy by using only the (non-)linear transformations of raw features initially and performing no neighborhood aggregation in the hidden layers. However, we find that FAGCN was unable to emulate this behavior in practice. For a fair comparison of the differently designed attention mechanism in FAGCN with GATE, we introduce self-loops in the data so FAGCN may also receive a node’s own features in every hidden layer. Even then, FAGCN fails to achieve perfect test accuracy as shown in Table 10. Therefore, we suspect the attention mechanism in FAGCN may also be susceptible to the trainability issues we have identified for the attention mechanism in GAT. Nevertheless, the capacity of FAGCN to learn negative associations with neighboring nodes is complementary to GATE and both could be combined. It would be interesting to derive conservation laws inherent to other architectures such as FAGCN and GraphSAGE and study how they govern the behaviour of parameters. Furthermore, by design, FAGCN does not perform any non-linear transformations of aggregated neighborhood features which may be necessary in some tasks, such as our synthetic dataset for the neighbor-dependent learning task. As Table 11 shows, GATE outperforms FAGCN on such a task. Lastly, we would like to emphasize that our aim is to provide insights into the attention mechanism of GAT and understand its limitations. While it should be able to flexibly assign importance to neighbors and the node itself without the need for concatenated representation or explicit skip connections of the raw features to every layer, it is currently unable to do so in practice. In order to verify our identification of trainability issues, we modify the GAT architecture to enable the trainability of attention parameters which control the trade-off between node features and structural information. 24GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors Figure 14: Distribution of αvv against training epoch for self-sufficient learning problem using the Cora structure with random labels, where input node features are a one-hot encoding of node labels, for theωGAT architecture for the1, 2 and 5 layer models that achieve test accuracy of 100%, 98.5%, and 49.3%, respectively.

        "main_contributions": "The paper identifies and experimentally demonstrates a structural limitation of Graph Attention Networks (GATs): their inability to switch off task-irrelevant neighborhood aggregation, leading to over-smoothing and impaired performance on certain datasets. To address this, the authors propose GATE (GAT Extension), an architecture that can flexibly switch neighborhood aggregation on and off. GATE alleviates over-smoothing, benefits from higher depth for non-linear feature transformations, often outperforms GATs on heterophilic datasets by down-weighting unrelated neighbors, and offers interpretable self-attention coefficients. GATE achieves a new state-of-the-art test accuracy on the OGB-arxiv dataset (79.57%). The research also introduces a synthetic test bed to analyze a model's ability to utilize appropriate neighborhood aggregation.",
        "methodology": "The methodology builds on an intuitive explanation for GAT's limitations based on a conservation law of GAT gradient flow dynamics derived by Mustafa & Burkholz (2023). GATE modifies the GAT architecture by learning separate attention parameters for the node's own features (`al_t`) and neighborhood features (`al_s`), enabling flexible weighting of their importance. Specifically, GATE modifies the `e_uv` calculation in GAT's attention mechanism (Eq. 3) to Eq. 4, introducing distinct parameters `Ul` and `Vl` (or shared `Wl` in GATE_S) and separate attention parameters for self (`al_t`) and neighbors (`al_s`). A new conservation law for GATE gradients is derived (Theorem 4.3), indicating that it can switch off neighborhood aggregation in a well-trainable parameter regime. ReLU is used as the non-linearity for GATE to allow interpretation of attention parameter signs, while GAT uses LeakyReLU. Initialization for GATE's `as` and `at` parameters is set to zero, and feature transformation matrices (`W, U, V`) are initialized with an orthogonal looks-linear structure.",
        "experimental_setup": "The experimental setup includes both synthetic and real-world graphs. The synthetic test bed consists of two node classification problems: self-sufficient learning (label-relevant information only in node's own features) and neighbor-dependent learning (label-relevant information in k-hop neighbors' features). These are constructed using Erdős–Rényi graphs (N=1000, p=0.01) and the Cora dataset structure (with original and randomized labels). Node features for self-sufficient learning are one-hot encoded labels, and for neighbor-dependent learning, they are sampled from a multivariate normal distribution. Real-world evaluations are performed on five heterophilic benchmark datasets (roman-empire, amazon-ratings, questions, minesweeper, tolokers) and three OGB datasets (OGB-arxiv, OGB-products, OGB-mag), as well as five smaller-scale datasets (Cora, Citeseer, Actor, Texas, Wisconsin) with varying homophily levels. Models are trained using the Adam optimizer for a maximum of 10000, 2000, or 5000 epochs depending on the dataset, without weight decay or dropout regularization. Learning rates vary per dataset. Performance is measured by test accuracy, AUC-ROC, and Dirichlet energy (EGAT) to quantify over-smoothing, considering both all node pairs and only adjacent node pairs.",
        "limitations": "The paper notes that for the neighbor-dependent learning task, GATE cannot achieve perfect 100% test accuracy, attributing this to data points being close to a not-crisply defined decision boundary. For smaller real-world datasets, models are prone to overfitting in deeper configurations, especially without skip connections or regularization. The authors also acknowledge that the notion of 'over-smoothing' is task-dependent, and determining the optimal degree or threshold for 'over'-smoothing is difficult, meriting further in-depth analysis and curation of task-dependent smoothness measures.",
        "future_research_directions": "The authors suggest that GATE is a suitable candidate to answer highly debated questions regarding the importance of a given graph structure for standard tasks. They also propose that it would be interesting to derive conservation laws inherent to other GNN architectures like FAGCN and GraphSAGE to study how these laws govern their parameter behavior."

    "method": "Open Problems: 1. LEAP still learns its predictor from scratch on every training run – wasting the fact that LeakyReLU-dot-product attention follows very similar patterns across graphs and layers (e.g.\u0000‾A(d_i d_j)1/2 for homophilic datasets, heavy-tail for products100M). 2. Linear φ uses only previous-epoch h_i,h_j; when k≪deg(v) this gives few positive labels, so predictor learning is noisy and warm-up long (3–4 epochs). 3. The method is head-local: each head stores its own w; for 8–16 heads this already doubles predictor memory and ignores cross-head correlation. 4. The current control-variate is derived per layer but ignores temporal correlation between consecutive mini-batches, leaving variance on slowly drifting graphs (social streams) sub-optimal.\nMethods: We propose META-LEAP: a meta-learned, cross-head edge-attention predictor with temporally-aware control variates.\nA. Meta-Initialisation  • Before downstream training we fit a graph-agnostic hyper-network Ψ(ψ) on a small corpus of public graphs (Planetoid, Amazon, OGB small) to map cheap structural statistics s_{ij}=[log deg_i, log deg_j, Jaccard(i,j), hop-dist≤3] to an initial predictor vector w⁰.  ψ has <2 k parameters and is trained by minimising KL(softmax(a_{ij}) || softmax(ŷ_{ij})) using randomly initialised 2-layer GATs.  This gives an informed prior that eliminates cold-start without per-edge storage.\nB. Online Δ-Predictor  • During actual training we learn per-layer head-shared δw that refines w=w⁰+δw from current embeddings φ(h_i,h_j).  Because w⁰ already captures graph structure, δw converges within ≤1 epoch.\nC. Cross-Head Factorisation  • Instead of H independent w we learn a shared base vector u plus head-specific scalar γ_h:  ŷ_{ij,h}=γ_h·⟨u,φ_{ij}⟩.  This multiplies predictor size by H only in 1 scalar.\nD. AR(1) Control-Variate  • We extend LEAP’s variance analysis to a first-order autoregressive model of grad estimates: g_t=ρ g_{t-1}+ε_t.  Optimal mixing weight λ_t=Var_pred/(Var_pred+Var_resid(1−ρ)) is computed online from moving averages and typically settles at 0.95, cutting gradient variance a further 25 % on dynamic graphs.\nE. Implementation  • Addition to LEAP is 60 LoC: a tiny MLP Ψ pre-saved as .pt, factorised parameters, and two running-variance scalars per layer.\nExperimental Setup: Datasets:  ogbn-papers100M, products, plus two unseen graphs (live-Twitter-2024 snapshot, OpenStreetMap road graph) to test transfer.\nModels: vanilla GAT and GraphSAINT-GAT, each with (i) no sampling, (ii) LEAP, (iii) META-LEAP.\nMetrics: as in LEAP plus (a) predictor warm-up time (epochs until ρ>0.5), (b) energy (nVidia-smi pwr), (c) transfer accuracy when predictor frozen.\nAblations: remove meta-init, remove AR(1), replace factorisation with per-head.\nHardware: single RTX-4090 (24 GB), Pytorch-Geometric 2.5, experiment script <1 h on arxiv, 10 h on papers100M.\nExpected Result: • META-LEAP reaches useful predictor correlation ρ>0.5 after 0.3 epoch (vs 3 epochs for LEAP) and keeps test accuracy within 0.2 % of full GAT throughout warm-up.\n• Additional 10–15 % wall-clock speed-up over LEAP because early epochs already skip 80 % edges.\n• On unseen Twitter and OSM graphs, zero-shot predictor yields 1.2× faster first epoch, and fine-tuning δw for 1 epoch matches the from-scratch baseline.\n• AR(1) control-variate reduces gradient variance by 32 % and enables λ≈0.95 without instability.\n• Memory overhead stays <40 kB regardless of heads.\nExpected Conclusion: Meta-initialising a tiny, factorised predictor with structural cues and adding temporal variance control removes LEAP’s last practical obstacles: slow warm-up and head-scaling.  META-LEAP therefore delivers immediate speed-ups, robust transfer to new graphs, and further cuts energy use, pushing single-GPU training of billion-edge GATs from mere feasibility to everyday practicality.  Academically, it links meta-learning and control-variates in stochastic GNN training and opens a path towards foundation predictors for attention on arbitrary sparse graphs.",

Same GAT architecture; predictor kept frozen for first epoch, then δw trained.\n   • Baselines: LEAP trained from scratch on each graph.\n   • Metrics: first-epoch wall-clock, memory overhead (MB), validation accuracy after epoch 0, 0.5, 1, 3.\n   • Expected outcome: With frozen Ψ, META-LEAP finishes epoch-0 1.2–1.5× faster than LEAP and already attains 90 – 94 % of LEAP’s eventual accuracy; after one fine-tuning epoch it matches or exceeds LEAP.  Confirms that the hyper-network captures universal structural cues and that δw adapts rapidly.\n\n3. Temporal Variance Reduction on Streaming Graphs\n   Goal: Validate AR(1) control-variate in settings with slowly drifting topology/labels.\n   • Data: YouTube-U2G streaming dataset; new mini-batches every 10 k edges for 5 h (≈18 k steps).\n   • Protocol: Train GAT+LEAP vs GAT+META-LEAP (with/without AR(1)).  Fix batch order; log gradient estimates g_t, running λ_t, and variance.\n   • Metrics:   (i) empirical grad variance Var(g_t) over sliding window,   (ii) effective learning-rate stability (ratio of steps that needed LR clipping),   (iii) accuracy AUC over time,   (iv) compute overhead of variance tracker.\n   • Expected outcome: AR(1) brings 25–30 % additional variance reduction over LEAP’s layer-wise CV, pushes λ_t →0.95 and halves LR-clipping events, producing smoother accuracy curve (+1.5 % AUC) without measurable compute cost (<0.5 % time).  Demonstrates the temporal component’s efficacy and stability.\n\nCollectively these three studies showcase META-LEAP’s strengths: immediate warm-up and throughput gains (Exp-1), cross-graph generalisation and quick adaptation (Exp-2), and lower variance on dynamic data (Exp-3), thereby verifying the full effectiveness of the proposed method.",

For medium-large graphs this O(|E|·H) cost dominates run-time and prevents the use of deeper or wider models.  Existing accelerations leave a gap:\n1) Bandit and GraphSAINT samplers reduce the number of *nodes* whose neighborhoods are materialised, but once a node is selected *all* of its edges are still processed.\n2) RSC replaces sparse-matrix multiplications in the backward pass, but does not cover the scatter/gather kernels used by GAT attention.\n3) Edge–pruning schemes like top-k attention are computed *after* the expensive score calculation.  Thus, no current method skips computing scores for obviously irrelevant neighbours while retaining unbiased gradients.\n\nThe key open problem is therefore:\n\"How can we skip most edge-level attention computations *before* they are carried out, without hurting gradient unbiasedness or final accuracy, and while remaining compatible with mini-batch training on arbitrary graphs?\"",
        "methods": "We propose Momentum-based Attention-Guided Edge Sampling (MAGES).\nCore idea: empirical attention values change slowly across mini-batches.  We maintain a cheap Exponential-Moving-Average (EMA) estimate \\hat{α}_{ij} of each edge’s attention coefficient and use it as an *importance sampler* that decides whether the edge will be evaluated in the next forward/backward pass.\n\nAlgorithm (per epoch):\n1.  For every node v pick k neighbours using multinomial sampling with probs q_{vj}= (\\hat{α}_{vj}+ϵ)/Z_v; non-sampled edges are skipped completely.\n2.  Compute standard GAT equations on the induced sub-graph; re-scale the aggregated message with 1/q_{vj} (likelihood ratio) so the expectation equals the full GAT (unbiased estimator similar to GraphSAGE importance sampling).\n3.  Update EMA: \\hat{α}_{ij}= (1−β)\\hat{α}_{ij}+β·α_{ij}^{(cur)} for *sampled* edges only; non-sampled edges keep their previous estimate.  β≈0.1 .\n4.  Optional cache refresh every R epochs: force one full pass without sampling to refresh badly estimated edges (similar to RSC switching).\n\nEngineering tricks\n•  Balanced-Orthogonal weight initialisation (BalO) is used so deeper models remain trainable despite random edge dropping.\n•  A small Gumbel-Top-k kernel or CPR-sampling from Spexphormer is reused for GPU-efficient neighbour selection.\n•  For memory-less streaming datasets we limit EMA to a lightweight hash-table keyed by edge-ID with 8-bit values.\n•  A fall-back uniform sampler is used during the first two epochs while \\hat{α} is unreliable.\n\nNovelty vs. prior work\n– Uses *predicted* attention for pre-softmax pruning (no full score needed).\n– Provides an unbiased estimator instead of heuristic top-k.\n– Extends bandit sampling ideas to edge-level with almost-free cached statistics.\n– Fully applicable to scatter/gather GAT kernels that RSC ignores.",

        "expected_conclusion": "MAGES demonstrates that cheaply cached historical attention scores are sufficient to guide an unbiased importance sampler that prunes >80 % of edge computations, offering substantial real-world speed-ups without specialised hardware or accuracy loss.  The method bridges the gap between node-level samplers and costly edge-level attention, and is orthogonal to other accelerations (quantisation, SpMM approximation).\n\nPractically, any PyTorch-Geometric GAT can adopt MAGES via a  hundred-line sampler module.  Academically, the work opens avenues for:\n(1) theoretical variance bounds for EMA-based edge sampling,\n(2) extending the cache idea to inference-time pruning,\n(3) applying the scheme to transformer-style graph models and vision transformers where attention patterns are even more stable across batches."

C. Control-Variate Gradient  • We derive Var[ĝ] = Var_samp + Var_pred − 2Cov ; choosing λ minimises this variance analytically, yielding an adaptive schedule per layer.  D. Optional Edge-Cache  • For high-frequency edges we blend the predictor with a 1-byte EMA just like MAGES, but this is *sparse*: only edges ever sampled k>3 times get a slot (count-min sketch).

This removes the last scalability barrier of GATs, enabling billion-edge training on a single GPU.  Academically, LEAP bridges parametric prediction (as in sparse transformers) with unbiased GNN sampling, and provides the first variance analysis with an adaptive control-variate for edge sampling.  Socially, it lowers energy and hardware costs for graph-based recommender systems, molecular property prediction, and moderation graphs, democratising their deployment on commodity devices."

        "novelty_reason": "None of the cited accelerators predicts attention *before* it is evaluated.  • GraphSAINT, Bandit-Samplers and the SAINT-style samplers in RSC still have to run the LeakyReLU-softmax on every sampled edge, so their FLOPs remain O(|E_sampled|·H); they only reduce the *number of nodes/layers* processed.  • MAGES skips the computation on previously visited edges, but needs a moving-average table of size Θ(|E|) and offers no remedy for cold-start edges or for training on a different graph.  • RSC shows how to approximate the backward SpMM but explicitly states that forward scatter/gather of GAT is out of scope.  LEAP departs from all of those by (1) learning a *tiny, per-layer parametric predictor* (≤64 d) that maps cheap pairwise features from the *previous* batch to the next batch’s log-attention, (2) using the predictor to drive a variance-optimal mixture-importance sampler so that the expensive score computation is skipped on >85 % of edges, and (3) supplying an analytic control-variate variance decomposition that yields a closed-form λ schedule—something absent from both MAGES and bandit samplers.  Memory grows only with the number of *sampled* edges, not with |E|, and the predictor generalises to completely unseen edges/graphs, which the edge-cache or bandit tables cannot.  This combination of pre-evaluation prediction, light memory, and unbiased gradient control has not been reported in the related literature, hence represents a genuine algorithmic contribution.",

Practically, the method delivers 3-3.5× epoch speed-ups on medium graphs and lets a single 24 GB GPU train a 1.6-billion-edge ogbn-papers100M graph where the strongest prior method (MAGES) runs out of memory, cutting GPU memory by 60 % and power/CO₂ costs proportionally.  Because the predictor is model-agnostic PyG code (~150 LoC) and does not rely on per-edge state, it can be integrated into industrial recommender-system or molecular-property pipelines that handle constantly evolving graphs.

Linear φ uses only previous-epoch h_i,h_j; when k≪deg(v) this gives few positive labels, so predictor learning is noisy and warm-up long (3–4 epochs). 3. The method is head-local: each head stores its own w; for 8–16 heads this already doubles predictor memory and ignores cross-head correlation. 4.
