Introduction Prompt engineering is the art of creating instructions to guide generative models. It is the key to unlocking the power of large models for both image generation and lan- guage tasks. As it stands today, prompt engineering meth- ods can be coarsely divided into two camps. First, there are hard prompting methods, which use hand-crafted se- quences of interpretable tokens to elicit model behaviors. Hard prompt discovery is a specialized alchemy, with many good prompts being discovered by trial and error, or sheer *Equal contribution.

Two shades of gray are used to show the token boundaries in the recovered prompt. intuition. Then there are soft prompts, which consist of continuous-valued language embeddings that do not corre- spond to any human-readable tokens. Soft prompt discovery is a mathematical science; gradient-based optimizers and large curated datasets are used to generate highly performant prompts for specialized tasks. Despite the difficulty of engineering hard prompts, they have their advantages. Hard prompts and the tricks they exploit can be mixed, matched, and mutated to perform a range of different tasks, while soft prompts are highly specialized. Hard prompts are portable; they can be discovered using arXiv:2302.03668v2  [cs.LG]  1 Jun 2023Gradient-Based Discrete Optimization for Prompt Tuning and Discovery 2 one model and then deployed on another. This portability is impossible with soft prompts due to differences in embed- ding dimension and representation space between models. Finally, hard prompts can be used when only API access to a model is available and it is not possible to control the embeddings of inputs. This work explores the use of efficient gradient methods to optimize and learn discrete text, with an emphasis on appli- cations to prompt engineering. In doing so, we unlock the ability to learn hard prompts via optimization. Learned hard prompts combine the ease and automation of soft prompts with the portability, flexibility, and simplicity of hard prompts. Our primary contributions are summarized as follows: ‚Ä¢ We propose a simple scheme for learning hard prompts using continuous optimization. The scheme builds on existing gradient reprojection schemes for optimizing text, and adapts lessons learned from the large-scale discrete optimization literature for quantized networks. ‚Ä¢ We show that this optimization method can be used to learn hard prompts for image generation, giving us a general tool to create prompts that elicit specific image styles, objects, and appearances. The learned prompts perform competitively with highly specialized prompt generation tools, despite using far fewer tokens and containing no hand-crafted components. ‚Ä¢ We also show that our learned hard prompts perform well on language classification tasks, out-performing other text optimization schemes. The learned prompts transfer well across networks, and this transfer is en- hanced when they are regularized with fluency con- straints to improve interpretability. In addition to capturing the quantifiable benefits of learned prompts, the proposed schemes can be used to facilitate prompt exploration and discovery , as optimization often recovers words and tokens that are simultaneously highly interpretable and also highly non-obvious. 2. Related Works Prompting in Language Models.Brown et al. (2020) was one of the first to demonstrate the power of prompting for task adaption of pre-trained language models. This ‚Äúinstruc- tion tuning‚Äù paradigm has since become a standard way to increase the ability of large models to follow complex, task- specific instructions (Sanh et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022). However, automatically finding suitable sets of text prompts, i.e. hard prompts, for these purposes remains an open challenge. Lester et al. (2021b) simplified the ‚Äúprefix tun- ing‚Äù technique presented in Li & Liang (2021) to establish the procedure referred to as standard soft ‚Äúprompt-tuning‚Äù where they optimize sequences of continuous-valued em- beddings prepended to the real embeddings of the input to- kens. However, subsequent work by Khashabi et al. (2022) showed that the sequences of embeddings produced by this technique could map to token sequences with limited se- mantic scrutability. To address these limitations, in this work we construct a method for hybridizing the continuous soft-prompt optimization with hard vocabulary constraints, resulting in task-specific, interpretable tokens. Discrete Optimization for Language.AutoPrompt (Shin et al., 2020) was one of the first discrete prompt optimiza- tion frameworks for transformer language models and subse- quent approaches have included a gradient-free phrase edit- ing method (Prasad et al., 2022), an embedding optimization approach based on Langevin dynamics (Shi et al., 2022) and a reinforcement learning approach (Deng et al., 2022). We consider two gradient-based methods as baselines: Flu- entPrompt and AutoPrompt (Shi et al., 2022; Shin et al., 2020). AutoPrompt, which utilizes HotFlip proposed by Ebrahimi et al. (2018), greedily chooses the optimal token for each location in the prompt utilizing the gradient to find a selection of good candidates. However, AutoPrompt can become expensive very quickly. For each gradient step, the method requires an evaluation of each candidate at each location in the prompt, adding numerous additional forward passes. To avoid the additional forward passes, we origi- nally considered AutoPromptk=1 with and without an added fluency constraint, but found that AutoPromptSGD with a flu- ency constraint outperformed its counterparts as seen in Figure 12, and thus we use SGD version of AutoPrompt as our other baseline similar to Shi et al. (2022). FluentPrompt differs from AutoPrompt by utilizing Langevin dynamics (Kumar et al., 2022) to optimize the prompt embeddings, as well as adding a fluency penalty. For the baselines discussed above, at the end of every update step, the optimized prompt embeddings are projected onto their nearest neighbor embeddings to ensure that optimiza- tion is performed on the discrete set of natural language tokens. However, if the nearest neighbors are far away from the embeddings and the learning rate is not tuned properly, the embeddings may become stagnant, which can require ex- tensive hyperparameter tuning as demonstrated in Figure 8. The cost of such a constraint is a loss of flexibility in the solu- tions the optimization can find. On the other hand, while soft prompts are not as limited in this way, just clamping a well- trained soft prompt to the nearest discrete prompt strongly degrades performance as observed in Khashabi et al. (2022). Prompt Discovery from Images.The process of extracting rich information from images and conveying it through natu- ral language texts is known asimage captioning. Zhang et al. (2021), Hu et al. (2022), and Li et al. (2022) achieve thisGradient-Based Discrete Optimization for Prompt Tuning and Discovery 3 goal by training large captioning models on image-text pairs. However, these captions are often generic and may not ac- curately reflect new or unseen objects. In Gal et al. (2022), the authors propose a method that utilizes a soft prompt to optimize a text-guided diffusion model, allowing for the generation of similar visual concepts to those in the original image. In this case, though the final soft prompt is effective, optimization through a diffusion model is very expensive, and the prompts are neither interpretable nor portable. Discrete Optimization.Discrete optimizers have long been used to train neural networks with quantized (e.g. binary) weights. In that context, the approach of re-projecting be- tween gradient steps is known as stochastic rounding. How- ever, it is known that this approach lacks the convergence guarantees of continuous optimization (Li et al., 2017). Over the last decade, stochastic rounding has been replaced by newer optimizers that maintain a continuous, rather than discrete, representation of the weights (Courbariaux et al., 2015). These optimizers consistently result in higher accu- racy (Rastegari et al., 2016; Courbariaux et al., 2016) and avoid local minima (Li et al., 2017). We take inspiration from these lessons learned in the binary networks community and adapt them to refine and simplify discrete optimizers for language. 3. Methodology Learning Hard Prompts.We now present our effective and easy-to-use technique for discrete prompt optimization. The process requires the following inputs: a frozen model,Œ∏, a sequence of learnable embeddings, P = [ei, ...eM], ei ‚àà Rd, where M is the number of ‚Äútokens‚Äù worth of vectors to optimize, and d is the dimension of the embeddings. Additionally, we employ an objective function L. The discreteness of the token space is realized using a projection function, ProjE, that takes the individual embedding vectors ei in the prompt and projects them to their nearest neighbor in the embedding matrix E|V |√ód where |V | is the vocab- ulary size of the model, and we denote the result of this operation as P‚Ä≤ = ProjE(P) := [ProjE(ei), ...ProjE(eM)]. Additionally, we define a broadcast function, B : R(M√ód) ‚Üí R(M√ód√ób) that repeats the current prompt embeddings (P) in the batch dimension b times. Formally, to learn a hard prompt, we minimize the following risk by measuring the performance of P on the task data: R(P‚Ä≤) =ED(L(Œ∏(B(P, X)), Y)). Our Method.We propose a simple but efficient gradient- based discrete optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of the baseline discrete optimization methods and soft prompt optimization. The steps of our scheme, which we call PEZ, are concretely defined in Algorithm 1. The method maintains continuous iterates, which in our Algorithm 1Hard Prompts made EaZy: PEZ Algorithm Input: Model Œ∏, vocabulary embedding E|V |, projec- tion function Proj, broadcast function B, optimization steps T, learning rate Œ≥, Dataset D Sampled from real embeddings: P = [ei, ...eM] ‚àº E|V | for 1, ..., Tdo Retrieve current mini-batch (X, Y) ‚äÜ D.

During each forward pass, we first project the current embeddings P onto the nearest neighbor P‚Ä≤ before calculating the gradient. Then, using the gradient of the discrete vectors, P‚Ä≤, we update the continuous/soft iterate, P. 4. Prompt Inversion with CLIP Our method for learning hard prompts is perfectly suited to multimodal vision-language models. With these models, like CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), we can use PEZ to discover captions which describe one or more target images. In turn, these discovered captions can be deployed as prompts for image generation applications. Since most text-guided diffusion models utilize pre-trained text encoders, such as the CLIP text encoder, and freeze them during training, we can discover prompts using these pre-trained text encoders that are directly relevant for downstream diffusion models. For instance, we can optimize a caption which describes an image and use this caption as a prompt for a diffusion model to generate other images with the same content. Since the CLIP model has its own image encoder, we can leverage it as a loss function to drive our PEZ method. This way we are optimizing prompts only for their cosine sim- ilarity to the CLIP image encoder, and avoiding gradient calculations on the full diffusion model altogether. Formally, given a text encoder function f and an image encoder function g, we optimize the hard prompt embedding P corresponding to a target image x by minimizing the following objective: L(P, x) = 1‚àí S(f(P), g(x)), where S is the cosine similarity between two vectors.Gradient-Based Discrete Optimization for Prompt Tuning and Discovery 4 Target Image Generated Image with Learned Hard Prompt prevmaverick ask figurative ecuador ntvmilkyway campfire uuuu romantic canvas impressionist sahi  üçÅakistan  üòè thankfully aviator doge appreciates managed managed fundraising pricing rowland pino percy lovely ponies moment seaside fra Figure 2.Generations using learned hard prompts on four different target images. For a given target image (left), a discrete text prompt is discovered using CLIP and used to prompt Stable Diffusion, generating new images (right). Two shades of gray are used to show the token boundaries in the recovered prompt. 4.1. Experimental Setting We conduct experiments on four datasets with diverse distri- butions: LAION (Schuhmann et al., 2022), MS COCO (Lin et al., 2014), Celeb-A (Liu et al., 2015), and Lexica.art (San- tana, 2022). LAION comprises over5 billion diverse images scraped from the internet, including photos and paintings. MS COCO mainly contains real-life photographs with mul- tiple common objects, whereas Celeb-A consists of celebrity portraits. Lexica.art is a set of AI-generated paintings with their prompts. We measure the quality of the prompt via image similarity between original (target) image, and an image generated using the learned hard prompt. To do so, we use a larger reference CLIP model, OpenCLIP-ViT/G, that was not used during optimization and serves as a neutral metric for se- mantic similarity between the images. We choose Stable Diffusion-v2 (Rombach et al., 2022) as our generative model, and the open-source CLIP model, OpenCLIP-ViT/H (Cherti et al., 2022) for crafting the prompt, as both share the same text encoder. During the prompt optimization process, we use a generic learning rate of 0.1 and run 3000 optimization steps using the AdamW op- timizer (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017). For Stable Diffusion- v2, we set the guidance scale to 9 and the number of infer- ence steps to 25. For each dataset, we randomly sample 100 data points and average CLIP scores over 5 runs with different random seeds.

We report the CLIP score between the original images and the images generated by the hard prompts.

To generate a descriptive hard prompt, this tool first uses a pre-trained captioning model, BLIP (Li et al., 2022) to create a caption of the target image. Then, top-k keywords from a pre-collected bank of keywords are appended to the caption based on CLIP scores between the keywords and the target image. These keywords were collected from various sources, including 5,265 artist names like ‚ÄúVan Gogh‚Äù and 100,970 phrases from prompt engineering, resulting in a diverse set. We find this keyword bank to contain most of the phrases from the Lexica.art dataset. CLIP Interrogator then greedily samples keywords until the prompt reaches CLIP‚Äôs token length limit of 77. 4.2. Results We show example hard prompts learned using our method and corresponding generations in Figure 2. The generated 1https://github.com/pharmapsychotic/ clip-interrogator images clearly show that the prompts effectively capture the semantic features of the target images. Further, the genera- tions are highly similar to the original images as measured by CLIP score and under visual inspection. Additionally, the hard prompts do not overfit to the original target image and produce a diverse set of generated images given different random seeds. Prompts are human readable, containing a mix of real words and gibberish (non-word token sequences). However, the valid words that are included in the prompts provide a sig- nificant amount of information about the image. For exam- ple, in the first row, we can see the words ‚Äúmilkyway‚Äù and ‚Äúcampfire,‚Äù which are the two main elements in the target im- age. Interestingly, the optimized prompts may also include emojis, like  present in the second row.  represents the trees on the side and also the color theme of the image. The optimization process seems to choose these emojis to in- clude useful information while keeping the prompt concise.Gradient-Based Discrete Optimization for Prompt Tuning and Discovery 6 Separate Generation Concatenated Generation +  = rowland pino percy lovely ponies moment seaside fra + kt fine netherlands apers - dreamy autumn rays +  = bway victorian traditional yd sofa ht vn hung  + wahoo gumbo payments vase sunflowers watercolor expresses quilt Figure 4.Concatenated learned hard prompts. We show the hard prompts learned on two unrelated images can be concatenated to fuse the semantic concepts in them. Further, we present quantitative evaluations in Table 1. Our method performs consistently across all four datasets and outperforms other gradient-based optimization baselines (full table can be found in Table 7). Notably, we can achieve similar performance to CLIP Interrogator, which has the highest CLIP score on LAION, MS COCO, Lexica.art, but not Celeb-A (The keyword bank in CLIP Interrogator does not include many words related to real human faces). How- ever, CLIP Interrogator uses a large curated prompt dataset, the image captioning model BLIP, and a large number of tokens (as many as 77), while our proposed method only uses the CLIP model for prompt discovery and 8 tokens in total demonstrating its simultaneous simplicity and strength. We ablate each of these differences. To do so, we include the keyword bank in our optimization method and only allow projections onto tokens from the keyword bank. Overall, we find that when adding this constraint to our model, and disabling BLIP to compare both methods on equal footing, we recover most of the quantitative difference between the methods on LAION and Lexica.art. Additionally, reducing the token length for the CLIP Interrogator, leads to a sharp drop in performance, again, particularly when normalizing by comparing both approaches at equal token lengths of 8. We note that even though Stable Diffusion and CLIP share the same text encoder, soft prompts do not transfer well compared to all hard prompt methods in our evaluation. Prompt Length. We further ablate the optimal number of tokens. In Figure 5, we find that longer prompts do not necessarily produce better results when generating with Stable Diffusion, even though they strictly reduce loss on the CLIP image encoder. Long prompts thus overfit and are less transferable, and we empirically find a length of 16 to 22 23 24 25 26 #T okens 0.665 0.670 0.675 0.680 0.685 0.690 0.695 0.700 0.705CLIP Score Mean CLIP Score Min CLIP Score Max CLIP Score Loss 0.52 0.54 0.56 0.58 0.60 Loss Figure 5.Ablation on prompt length, showing both train loss on the clip image encoder and validation CLIP score to generated Stable Diffusion images as prompt length increases. result in the most generalizable performance. 4.3. Style Transfer The proposed approach can also be easily adapted to style transfer. We follow the setting investigated with soft prompts in Gal et al. (2022) but with our hard prompts. Given several examples that share the same style, we extract their shared style characteristics into a single hard prompt and use this prompt to apply the style to new objects or scenes. Figure 3 presents two examples of style transfer, showing that our method can easily embed the shared style elements in the prompt and apply them to novel concepts.

With fewer tokens, the hard prompts can still generate images very similar in concept to the original. 4.4. Prompt Concatenation Learned hard prompts are also very useful as composable building blocks for intricate scenes. We test this in Figure 4, where we separately generate prompts for two unrelated images, and then fuse both images by concatenating their prompts. We find that even different concepts, such as painted horses on a beach and a realistic sunset in a forest can be combined via their generated prompts. 4.5. Prompt Distillation Another application where we can use our prompt opti- mization method is prompt distillation, reducing the length of prompts while preserving their capability. Distillation is useful in situations where the text encoder of the diffu- sion model has a limited maximum input length, such as the CLIP model, which has a maximum input length of 77 tokens. Also, long prompts may contain redundant and unimportant information, especially when hand-crafted, so we aim to distill their essence, preserving only important information in the prompt. We optimize a shorter prompt to match the features of the longer prompt simply based on its text encoder f. Given a target prompt‚Äôs embedding Ptarget and learnable embedding e, we simply modify our loss into: L = 1‚àí Sim(f(Ptarget), f(P)). We define the distillation ratio by |P|/|Ptarget|. In Figure 6, we show images generated by the original prompts and the distilled prompts with four different dis- tillation ratios: 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1. We see here that even with only 3 or 4 tokens, the hard prompts can still generate images very similar in concept to the original, successfully distilling the longer human-made instructions. 5. Discrete Prompt Tuning with Language Models In the text-to-text setting, the goal of Algorithm 1 is to discover a discrete sequence of tokens, the hard prompt, that will prompt the language model to predict the outcome of a classification task. Since an important property of text is its fluency, Shi et al. (2022) find that fluency can increase a prompt‚Äôs readability and performance. Thus, we define the optimization objective in this section as a weighted function of task loss and fluency loss, L = (1‚àí Œªfluency)Ltask + ŒªfluencyLfluency. We setŒª = 0.003 similar to Shi et al. (2022) for all methods, and we ablate our method without fluency (Œª = 0), which we denote as no fluency . We set out to show that hard prompts generated by this approach are successful both when transferring between a number of transformer-based language models, and also when used to discover prompts in few-shot settings. An attractive quality of these prompts, especially for language applications, is that they can be optimized on smaller language models and then transferred to other, much larger models.Gradient-Based Discrete Optimization for Prompt Tuning and Discovery 8 Table 2.Accuracy (%) and standard error on the SST-2 validation set across five prompts for each method learned on GPT-2 Large and transferred to larger models with 1.3B to 6.7B parameters.

Datasets and Setup We evaluate Algorithm 1 against related algorithms on three classification tasks, two sentiment analysis tasks, SST-2 (Socher et al., 2013) and Amazon Polarity (McAuley & Leskovec, 2013), and a 4-way classification task, AGNEWS (Zhang et al., 2015). We build on the setting explored in Ding et al. (2022) and optimize hard prompts using GPT-2 Large (774M parameters) (Radford et al., 2019) with the Adafactor optimizer (Shazeer & Stern, 2018) and a batch size of 32 (Lester et al., 2021a). We provide details for prompt templates and verbalizers in Table 4. Transferability Set-up.To test transferability, we generate prompts from GPT-2 Large for 5000 steps. We then select the five prompts with the highest average validation accuracy for each technique and test them on larger models. We test the transferred text on: GPT-2 XL, T5-LM-XL, OPT-2.7B, and OPT-6B (Radford et al., 2019; Lester et al., 2021b; Zhang et al., 2022), verifying the reliability of the proposed algorithm over related techniques and testing whether the hard prompt can reliably boost performance. Thus, we also consider a baseline of empty prompts, with only the template. Few-Shot Setup.For the few-shot setting, we optimize each prompt for 100 epochs on GPT-2 Large on the AGNEWS dataset, where we sample two examples (k = 2) and four examples (k = 4) from each class to obtain the training set. Additionally, we create a holdout set of the same size, and finally validate the prompts on the entire validation set. 5.2. Results We verify that our method is comparable to other methods in the sentiment analysis setting and outperforms the other methods on AGNEWS by about 2%. See Table 5 for details.

It is worth noting that each few-shot run takes about 5 minutes. We run 100 seeds where the training set contains k samples from each class and also qualitatively examine the top prompts. Although many of the prompts are non-interpretable, many are also coherent. For example, even for k = 2, some of the prompts included news sources like ‚ÄúBBC‚Äù, while other prompts find new approaches to the news classification task considering the text coming from a blog: ‚Äú Brian blog,‚Äù or ‚ÄúBlog Revolution analyze.‚Äù Due to the efficiency of these gradient-based methods, these methods can allow new ways for prompt engineers to discover novel prompts. 6. Safety Concerns Token or word-level content filters are often used in text- to-image diffusion model APIs to prevent the generation of differently for different models.Gradient-Based Discrete Optimization for Prompt Tuning and Discovery 9 Figure 7.Generated copyrighted image via Midjourney. Here, requested from the API only for research purposes. NSFW or copyrighted content. For instance, the image gen- eration API Midjourney has banned prompts containing the substring ‚ÄúAfghan‚Äù due to a copyright issue with the famous photo of an Afghan girl 3. However, prompt optimization can be used as a mechanism to bypass simple rule-based content filters. PEZ can gen- erate a prompt that avoids banned tokens, yet still matches textual features with the original target prompt ‚ÄúAfghan girl.‚Äù Figure 7 shows the output of Midjourney using an op- timized prompt which successfully reproduces the banned image without containing the banned word ‚ÄúAfghan.‚Äù Note that the prompt seems to incorrectly associate the subject of the image, Sharbat Gula, with the Taliban. Even if a defender now iterates the block-list and bans addi- tional words from the adversarial prompt, an attacker can consistently optimize around addition content restrictions, as we show in supplementary material Figure 10. Overall, we suspect that only complete feature-based content detec- tors have the potential to mitigate these concerns for model owners (Rando et al., 2022). 7. Conclusion We propose a new method that utilizes continuous em- beddings to reliably optimize hard prompts. The key ad- vantage of our method is the use of continuous, i.e. soft, prompts as intermediate variables during the optimization of hard prompt tokens, leveraging gradient-based optimiza- tion. This way, the algorithm selects locations in embedding space where discrete embeddings are useful, rather than simply optimizing a soft prompt and later projecting onto nearby token embeddings in the hopes that these nearby hard prompts will perform well too. Additionally, as our 3https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_ Girl method utilizes gradients across all steps by accumulating them into the soft prompt, this process makes optimization more robust to learning rates and potential noise in the data. Although our work makes progress toward prompt optimiza- tion, the community‚Äôs understanding of language model embedding space is still in its infancy, and a deeper under- standing of the geometry of the embedding space will likely enable even stronger prompt optimization in the future. Overall, we show through our experiments that hard prompts can be easily generated and flexibly used in practical ap- plications. Yet, a limitation of hard prompts is that even though they are human-readable, they may still contain sev- eral un-interpretable tokens. Additionally, hard prompts may possibly extract harmful phrases or sensitive content from a language model‚Äôs training data. Even though we did not observe specific instances of this behavior, it is a concern that should be taken into account in future applications. 8.

This thus motivates us to re-think the necessity of finding a global optimum in prompt optimization. To answer this, we conduct a thorough empirical study on prompt optimization and draw two major insights. Contrasting with the rarity of global optimum, local optima are usually prevalent and well-performed, which can be more worthwhile for efficient prompt optimiza- tion (Insight I). The choice of the input domain, covering both the generation and the representation of prompts, affects the identification of well-performing local optima (Insight II). Inspired by these insights, we propose a novel algorithm, namely localized zeroth-order prompt optimization (ZOPO), which incorporates a Neural Tangent Kernel-based derived Gaussian process into standard zeroth-order optimization for an efficient search of well-performing local optima in prompt optimization. Remarkably, ZOPO outperforms existing baselines in terms of both the optimization performance and the query efficiency, which we demonstrate through extensive experiments. 1 Introduction Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for understanding and generating natural languages (Ouyang et al., 2022a; Touvron et al., 2023). Thanks to the instruction- following abilities of LLMs (Ouyang et al., 2022b), prompting‚Äîadding crafted, discrete prompts, or namely natural language text, to the input emerges as an effective and lightweight approach to direct LLMs to generate specific, desired response (Mishra et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023). Such an approach is of particular interest when users interact with state-of-the-art LLMs like ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2024a) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), which can only be accessed through black-box APIs (i.e., the interface of black-box LLMs only accepts discrete texts as input for querying). So, prompt optimization becomes a critical effort in pursuing the optimal performance of black-box LLMs on downstream tasks. Although human knowledge may subjectively guide prompt designs (Reynolds & McDonell, 2021; Mishra et al., 2021), this process is commonly time-intensive and its results are not always desirable in practice. To mitigate such human efforts and achieve better performance in optimizing crafted prompts, random sampling (Zhou et al., 2023), Bayesian optimization (Chen et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023), and evolutionary algorithms (Guo et al., 2024) have been proposed to generate and select Preprint.

However, most of these existing strategies prioritizeglobal optimization, dedicating substantial portions of the query budget to explore the entire search space for the global optima and consequently making it query-inefficient in practice. Meanwhile, these strategies typically implement their prompt optimization across various input domains, resulting in diverse performance outcomes in practice. These results consequently inspire us to re-think the questions about the necessity of finding a global optimum and the essence of the input domain for efficient and effective prompt optimization. To answer these questions, we provide a thorough empirical study on prompt optimization. Firstly, we visualize the performance for a number of randomly sampled prompt candidates on various tasks to show that in contrast to the scarcity of global optima, local optima are commonly prevalent and per- form well, making them more valuable for query-efficient prompt optimization (Insight I in Sec. 3.1). Secondly, we visualize the estimated accuracy distributions for a number of prompt candidates as well as the corresponding function surfaces using various embeddings as their representation. The results demonstrate that the selection of the input domain, including both the generation and representation of prompt candidates, will influence the identification of high-performing prompts, especially those local optimal ones (Insight II in Sec. 3.2). These insights consequently highlight the importance of local optima and input domain for efficient and effective prompt optimization. Inspired by these insights, we novelly propose the Localized Zeroth-Order Prompt Optimization (ZOPO) algorithm for a considerably improved prompt optimization as evidenced by Fig. 1. Moti- vated by Insight II, we first propose a general domain transformation that utilizes LLMs for prompt generation and embedding models to transform these generated prompts into their corresponding hidden representations, which thereby enjoys not only the remarkable generation ability from any type of LLMs (white/black-box) (Zhou et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2024) but also the impressive representation ability from many NLP embedding models (Chen et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023) for our prompt opti- mization (Sec. 4.1). Inspired by Insight I, we then leverage a cutting-edge zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) method enhanced by a derived Gaussian process for efficient gradient estimation (Shu et al., 2023a) to underpin our localized prompt optimization, which goes one step further by incorporating the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) (Jacot et al., 2018) to handle the complex and high-dimensional prompt optimization tasks (Sec. 4.2). Lastly, we present an uncertainty-informed local exploration method designed to improve the gradient estimation in our derived NTK-GP framework, thereby augmenting the practical performance of the ZOPO algorithm (Sec. 4.3). We also conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of ZOPO (Sec. 5). To summarize, the contributions of our work include: ‚Ä¢ To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to conduct a thorough empirical study in prompt optimization to underscore the value of local optima and the essence of input domain for efficient and effective prompt optimization. 2taxonomy_animal  cause_and_effect  informal_to_formal 0.0 0.5 1.0 Figure 2: The validation accuracy of 300 randomly sampled prompts with the last token representation on various tasks. ‚Ä¢ Drawing on the insights gained from our empirical study, we introduce the ZOPO algorithm, which outperforms existing baselines in terms of not only the optimization performance but also the query efficiency. ‚Ä¢ We conduct extensive studies to confirm the efficacy of our algorithmic framework and elucidate the underlying principles or insights of our ZOPO algorithm. 2 Problem Setup Given an NLP task that is characterized by a data distribution D and a black-box LLM f(¬∑), e.g., ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2024a), discrete prompt optimization aims to generate a piece of human-readable text, namely the prompt v, which will then be applied to the black-box LLM f(¬∑) along with a test input x such that the queried LLM output f([v; x]) is able to correctly predict the ground-truth label y for each (x, y) ‚àº D. This problem is then commonly framed as a black-box maximization problem over the discrete language space v ‚àà ‚Ñ¶ (Chen et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023): max v‚àà‚Ñ¶ F(v) ‚âú E(x,y)‚ààDV [R(f([v; x]), y)] (1) where R(f([v; x]), y) is applied to measure the alignment between the LLM output f([v; x]) and the groundtruth y, and DV is the validation set sampled from D. Note that the performance of the optimal instruction found on DV (i.e., arg maxv F(v)) will be evaluated on a held-out test set DT . 3 Empirical Study on Prompt Optimization 3.1 Local Optima vs. Global Optimum In prompt optimization, methods like (Chen et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023) are generally more effective than the others (Zhou et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2024), which is usually contributed to their usage of Bayesian optimization, a popular global optimization strategy, that is able to find the global optimum in low-dimensional problems (Moriconi et al., 2020). However, these methods sometimes perform poorly in certain prompt optimization tasks, e.g., cause_and_effect and informal_to_formal, indicating that they will fail to find the global optimum in these tasks given a limited query budget. This is likely because substantial portions of the budget are applied in these methods to explore the entire search space for the global optimum, which hence leads to the critical question about the necessity of finding the global optimum in query-efficient prompt optimization. To answer this question, we have employed a 3-dimensional scatter plot to visualize the performance (differentiated by colors) for 300 randomly sampled prompt candidates on various tasks, whose prompt embeddings (i.e., the last token embedding as in Lin et al. (2023)) are reduced by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) (see more details in our Appx. C.1.1). The results are in Fig. 2 which shows that the global optimum (i.e., the points achieving an accuracy of ‚àº 100%) is consistently rare for a range of prompt optimization tasks, making it extremely challenging to achieve this global optimum in practice. In contrast, prompt optimization often features a number of local optima (e.g., the points achieving accuracy higher than 50% in all the three tasks of Fig.2). Importantly, these local optima commonly enjoy impressive performance, suggesting that local optima shall be more worthwhile to obtain in prompt optimization, especially for the scenarios of limited query budgets, as summarized below. 30.0 0.5 1.0 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0Probability Density taxonomy_animal Vicuna-13B ChatGPT 0.0 0.5 1.0 0 2 4 cause_and_effect Vicuna-13B ChatGPT 0.0 0.2 0.4 0 2 4 6 8 informal_to_formal Vicuna-13B ChatGPT Validation Accuracy Figure 3: The estimated accuracy distribution of prompts generated by Vicuna-13B or ChatGPT on various instruction induction tasks, where the vertical dotted line is the mean performance. Insight I Contrasting with the rarity of global optimum, local optima are usually prevalent and well- performed, which is more worthwhile for query-efficient prompt optimization. 3.2 Essence of Input Domain Besides, existing works (Chen et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2024) typically apply their prompt optimization in differing input domains, leading to a wide range of performances in practice. These results thus inspire us to ask: How essential is the input domain for finding well-performing prompts, particularly the local optimal ones? Thoroughly exploring this question is fundamental for the design of a well-performing prompt optimization algorithm. To answer this, we first visualize the accuracy distributions of 300 prompt candidates that are randomly generated by Vicuna-13B and ChatGPT for various tasks to study the essence of prompt generation in Fig. 3 (more details in Appx. C.1.2). Fig. 3 reveals that the prompt candidates produced by ChatGPT (a black-box model) generally exhibit better performance than those produced by Vicuna-13B (a white-box model), which has been widely applied in (Chen et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023) for prompt optimization. Importantly, ChatGPT demonstrates a greater likelihood of generating locally optimal prompt candidates (e.g., the ones of accuracy higher than 0.5 across all the three plots in Fig. 3). These results indicate that the ability to generate well-performing local optima in prompt optimization usually varies for different NLP models. So, the selection of the prompt generation model is crucial for finding well-performing optima. We then investigate the function surface (i.e., accuracy landscape) using two different embeddings as the representation for prompt candidates in Fig. 4 (more details in Appx. C.1.2) where the embeddings are mapped into a 2-dimensional domain using the t-SNE for better visualizations. Interestingly, Fig. 4 unveils that different representations will convey a varying number of well-performing local optima in practice. Particularly, the last token embedding is usually able to produce a larger number of well- performing local optima than the SBERT (i.e., a popular sentence embedding transformer Reimers & Gurevych (2019)) embedding, making it easier to enjoy a good prompt optimization performance on this domain, as validated in Tab. 5. This therefore implies that the choice of the prompt representation model is also essential for the finding of well-performing optima. In all, we conclude our aforementioned insights as below. Insight II The choice of the input domain, covering both the generation and the representation of prompt candidates, affects the identification of well-performing local optima. 4 The ZOPO Algorithm Given the insights established in our Sec. 3, we then propose our Localized Zeroth-Order Prompt Optimization (ZOPO) algorithm (Algo. 1) for a better-performing as well as more query-efficient 4Last Token taxonomy_animalSBERT cause_and_effect informal_to_formal 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Figure 4: The function surfaces on various tasks using the last token embedding from Vicuna-13B or the SBERT embedding as the representation for prompt candidates that are generated by Vicuna-13B.

Specifically, following our Insight II, we first develop a more general transfor- mation for the input domain of prompt optimization (Sec. 4.1), which can enjoy both the remarkable generation ability from any type of LLMs (white/black-box) and the impressive representation ability from many NLP models. Subsequent to this transformation, inspired by our Insight I, we propose to use zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) with a derived NTK Gaussian process inspired from (Shu et al., 2023a) to find well-performing local optima (Sec. 4.2). Lastly, we introduce an uncertainty-informed local exploration technique to refine the gradient estimation in our derived NTK Gaussian process, aiming to enhance the performance of our ZOPO algorithm in practice (Sec. 4.3). 4.1 A More General Input Domain Transformation As introduced in our Sec. 3.2, the choice of input domain (including the generation and representation of candidates) significantly influences the ultimate performance in prompt optimization: Black-box LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) typically enjoy an advanced generation ability and different embedding models (e.g., SBERT) have varying representative capacity for prompt optimization. This naturally inspires us to develop an improved domain transformation that can utilize not only the remarkable generation ability from white/black-box LLMs but also the impressive representation ability from certain NLP models for our prompt optimization. To achieve this, we propose to make use of the prompt v ‚àà ‚Ñ¶ generated from a LLM g(¬∑) and subsequently transform it into a continuous hidden representation z ‚àà Z ‚äÇRd by other sentence embedding model h(¬∑) for the optimization, i.e., v = h‚àí1(z), where (1) can then be re-framed as max z‚ààZ eF(z) = E(x,y)‚ààD \u0002 R \u0000 f([h‚àí1(z); x]), y \u0001\u0003 . (2) 5Of note, our input domain transformation and (2) enjoy a number of major advantages compared with previous works: (a) Different from the direct optimization over the discrete and complex language space v ‚àà ‚Ñ¶ in Guo et al. (2024) where optimization algorithms in the numerical domain can hardly be applied, our transformed input domain leads to a dense numerical space of lower dimension and therefore allows the usage of query-efficient optimization algorithms for (2) (e.g., our Algo. 1). (b) Different from the potential many-to-one mapping in the previous works (Chen et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023), i.e., the same discrete prompt v may be generated by various continuous soft prompts s, we develop a one-to-one mapping where one prompt generally has a unique hidden representation z, which thus can help eliminate the redundant queries during optimization and ultimately lead to more query-efficient prompt optimization. (c) Our domain transformation with an independent generation and representation process is capable of enjoying the remarkable generation ability from any type of LLMs (white/black-box) and the impressive representation ability from many NLP models whereas previous works are highly restricted to the LLMs, thus leading to a wider application. Practical Implementations. Before the start of the optimization on (2), we usually generate numerous prompt candidates V = {v} and their corresponding representations Z = {z} (line 2-6 of Algo. 1). Two practical methods are considered here for prompt generation: (a) Feeding randomly sampled soft prompts s ‚àà Rd and a few demonstrations Ddemo into a white-box LLM g(¬∑). (b) Sampling the output distribution of a black-box LLM g(¬∑) given a generation template filled with Ddemo. The representations Z can be produced by an NLP model h(¬∑). Specifically, if we consider the generation method in (a), z can be chosen as the last token embedding from g(¬∑) Lin et al. (2023) or the soft prompt s Chen et al. (2023) when generating v. Here h(¬∑) then represents a mapping function from v to z. 4.2 Local Optimization with Derived NTK-GP As local optima are more prevalent than global optimum and can exhibit compelling performance for prompt optimization tasks (Sec. 3.1), we propose to apply zeroth-order optimization (ZOO), particu- larly gradient descent using estimated gradients, for a well-performing local prompt optimization on our transformed input domain Z in Sec. 4.1. Unfortunately, existing ZOO algorithms are typically query-inefficient as many additional queries are required for gradient estimation in every gradient descent update (Flaxman et al., 2005; Nesterov & Spokoiny, 2017). In light of this, we resort to the most recent ZoRD algorithm (Shu et al., 2023a) where a localized surrogate model will be applied for query-efficient gradient estimations. Specifically, according to (Shu et al., 2023a), given a well-specified kernel function k(¬∑, ¬∑) such that the function eF is sampled from a Gaussian process eF ‚àº GP(0, k(¬∑, ¬∑)) or alternatively minG‚àºGP(0,k(¬∑,¬∑)) maxz‚ààZ | eF(z) ‚àí G(z)| = 0 and the observed value r of function eF follows the Gaussian noise N(0, œÉ2), then conditioned on the history of function queriesDt ‚âú {(zœÑ , rœÑ )}t œÑ=1 of size t, ‚àá eF follows a derived Gaussian Process GP(¬µ(¬∑), Œ£(¬∑, ¬∑)) , i.e., ‚àá eF ‚àº GP \u0000 ¬µt(¬∑), Œ£2 t (¬∑, ¬∑) \u0001 , (3) in which the mean function ¬µt(¬∑) and the covariance function Œ£2 t (¬∑, ¬∑) are defined as ¬µt(z) ‚âú kt(z)‚ä§ \u0000 Kt + œÉ2I \u0001‚àí1 rt , Œ£2 t (z, z‚Ä≤) ‚âú k‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(z, z‚Ä≤) ‚àí kt(z)‚ä§ \u0000 Kt + œÉ2I \u0001‚àí1 kt(z‚Ä≤) . (4) Here, kt(z)‚ä§ ‚âú [‚àÇzk(z, zœÑ )]t œÑ=1 is a d √ó t-dimensional matrix, Kt ‚âú [k(zœÑ , k(zœÑ‚Ä≤ )]t œÑ,œÑ ‚Ä≤=1 is a t √ó t- dimensional matrix, r‚ä§ t ‚âú [rœÑ ]t œÑ=1 is a t-dimensional column vector, and k‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(z, z‚Ä≤) ‚âú ‚àÇz‚àÇz‚Ä≤ k(z, z‚Ä≤) is a d √ó d-dimensional matrix. As a result, ¬µt(z) can be applied to estimate the gradient of the black-box function eF at input z. Of note, the underlying black-box function eF here is highly related to deep neural networks (DNN), more specifically transformers. It naturally inspires us to apply the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) (Jacot et al., 2018) theory for a better approach to the aforementioned assumption of a well-specified kernel function k(¬∑, ¬∑). This is because it has been widely proven that NTK is capable of well characterizing the predictions of neural networks (Arora et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2019; Shu et al., 2022a,b) and therefore should be a better-specified kernel in the setting of prompt optimization than 6the simple kernel (i.e., Mat√©rn kernel) applied in ZoRD (Shu et al., 2023a). Specifically, given a neural network œï(Œ∏, z) parameterized by Œ∏ ‚àà Rp, we employ the following empirical NTK as the kernel in (3) and (4): k(z, z‚Ä≤) = ‚àáŒ∏œï(Œ∏, z)‚ä§‚àáŒ∏œï(Œ∏, z) \f\f\f Œ∏=Œ∏0 (5) where Œ∏0 is the initialized parameter of neural network œï. By incorporating (5) into (4), we realize the derived NTK-GP for the gradient estimation in our prompt optimization. Based on this derived NTK-GP, we finally apply standard first-order optimization (e.g., stochastic gradient descent) with projected gradients for our local prompt optimization. Specifically, in every iteration t of our Algo. 1, the next promising prompt candidate will be selected via: vt+1 = h‚àí1 (PZ(zt + Œ∑t¬µt(zt))) (6) where PZ(z) ‚âú arg minz‚Ä≤‚ààZ ‚à•z ‚àí z‚Ä≤‚à• is the projection function that projects the updated z ‚àà Rd into domain Z and Œ∑t is learning rate. Practical Implementations. Following the modeling principle of local optimization, only the neighbors of z in the query history Dt are used to calculate the gradient ¬µt(z). As we do not know the exact DNN for the underlying black-box function eF, we propose to approximate it using a small DNN, which is still able to work well thanks to the theoretically guaranteed universal approximation ability of DNNs (Shen et al., 2022; Kratsios & Papon, 2022). Our experiments in Sec. 5.3 will further validate the effectiveness of this implementation. 4.3 Uncertainty-Informed Local Exploration Though the derived NTK-GP allows us to estimate the gradient at any z ‚àà Zaccording to (Shu et al., 2023a), we introduce the following Prop. 1 to demonstrate that the error in gradient estimation at a specific input z ‚àà Zimplies considerable variability, which is strongly correlated with the number of historical queries that are effectively relevant for the gradient estimation at the specific input z ‚àà Z. This insight, in turn, motivates the creation of our uncertainty-informed local exploration approach, as opposed to the adoption of the virtual update mechanism described in (Shu et al., 2023a) for our prompt optimization strategy. Proposition 1. Assume k(z, z‚Ä≤) ‚â§ Œ± and ‚à•k‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(z, z)‚à• ‚â§Œ∫ for any z, z‚Ä≤ ‚àà Z. Let Œ¥ ‚àà (0, 1) and Nz,Œ≤ ‚âú {z‚Ä≤ ‚àà {zœÑ }t œÑ=1 | ‚à•‚àÇzk(z‚Ä≤, z)‚à•2 ‚â• Œ≤} for given input z ‚àà Z, the following holds with a probability of at least 1 ‚àí Œ¥, ‚à•¬µt(z) ‚àí ‚àáF(z)‚à•2 ‚â§ œâ \r\rŒ£2 t (z) \r\r ‚â§ œâŒ∫ ‚àí œâŒ≤/d Œ± + œÉ2/|Nz,Œ≤| where œâ = d + 2( ‚àö d + 1) ln(1/Œ¥) and Œ£2 t (z) ‚âú Œ£2 t (z, z). Here, Nz,Œ≤ denotes a set of historical input queries that are effectively relevant for the gradient estimation at z where Œ≤ can be regarded as a measure of effective relevance. Prop. 1 shows that the gradient estimation error of (3) at a specific input z ‚àà Zis bounded by the norm of covariance matrix Œ£2 t (z), which is related to the query set Nz,Œ≤ of effective relevance. Specifically, the gradient estimation error at different z varies if the effective relevanceŒ≤ and the number of relevant queries |Nz,Œ≤| varies with z. When Œ≤ or |Nz,Œ≤| becomes small during ZOO, the gradient estimation error is likely increased, which will lead to poor performance in practice. This likely will happen in prompt optimization especially considering the sparsity of prompt candidates w.r.t. the continuous domain Rd. That is, both the effective relevance Œ≤ and the number of relevant queries |Nz,Œ≤| can be small due to this sparsity. As a consequence, additional input queries should be conducted to increase both Œ≤ and |Nz,Œ≤| for a better-performing prompt optimization. To this end, we propose an uncertainty-informed local exploration method that utilizes additional input queries from local searches to reduce predictive uncertainty and hence the gradient estimation error in derived NTK-GP according to Prop. 1. Specifically, we propose the local exploration condition informed by the local trajectory: 1At(zt) = \u001a 1 zt ‚àà At 0 zt /‚àà At 7Table 1: Average test accuracy with standard error (3 runs) for the best prompt found by different methods for 20 instruction induction tasks. ‚àÜ1 indicates the accuracy gap between ZOPO and the best-performing baselines (among APE, InstructZero, INSTINCT, and EvoPrompt). ‚àÜ2 indicates the accuracy gap of ZOPOGPT.

If this condition is met (i.e., 1At(zt) = 1), we will query the neighbors of zt in the local region to update our derived NTK-GP, thus improving its gradient estimation. Practical Implementations.

(2023), InstructZero Chen et al. (2023), INSTINCT Lin et al. (2023), and Evo- Prompt Guo et al. (2024), on instruction induction tasks Honovich et al. (2023), and on the arithmetic reasoning tasks with improved chain-of-thought prompts Zhou et al. (2023); Lin et al. (2023). We use the performance profile Dolan & Mor√© (2002), defined in Appx. B.1, as the overall evaluation metric that measures the frequency (i.e., œÅ(œÑ)) of a method within some distance (i.e., œÑ) from the highest accuracy achieved by any method. We defer more details on the experiments to Appx. B. 5.1 Instruction Induction Instruction induction tasks are commonly used to investigate the prompt optimization performance by assessing LLM‚Äôs zero-shot in-context learning ability in previous works (Zhou et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023). Although our ZOPO is a general prompt optimization method given any prompt generation strategy, here we follow the same setting of prompt generation from INSTINCT and InstructZero, only for fair comparison. We also adopt the last token embedding from Vicuna-13B as the prompt representation (same as INSTINCT). Here Vicuna-13B is used to generate task-specific prompts by feeding random soft prompts, and ChatGPT, as the black-box LLM, is the objective function for prompt evaluation, with a fixed query budget of 165. Similarly, we also perform a grid search over soft prompt hyperparameters on the validation set. More experimental details are deferred to Appx. B.3. Superior performance of ZOPO. For better distinguishability, we follow the experimental setting from Lin et al.

For more results on all 30 tasks, refer to Tab. 3 in Appx. C.2, where the ZOPO consistently outperforms existing methods. ZOPO has better query efficiency. To justify that our local optimization method is more query- efficient, we compare ZOPO against baselines at different query budget scales. The results shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 10 in Appx. C.2 illustrate that ZOPO generally achieves better performance with the same number of queries compared with other baseline methods and yields superior performance upon convergence. We notice that ZOPO achieves lower validation accuracy yet higher test accuracy on the taxonomy_animal task than INSTINCT, which suggest ZOPO likely has better generalization ability. Connecting ChatGPT with ZOPO. With our proposed domain transformation, we empirically demonstrate that ZOPO is capable of performing numerical optimization on ChatGPT-generated prompts. Specifically, we use the same generation method as in APE (Zhou et al., 2023) to generate task-specific prompts (i.e., V) from ChatGPT, and use a popular embedding model SBERT to provide the corresponding sentence embeddings (i.e., Z) for V. Then we apply ZOPO to perform optimization over the given V and Z, which we name ZOPOGPT. The result of ZOPOGPT compared against other baselines is shown in Tab. 1, with the corresponding performance profile shown in Fig. 9 in App. C.2. Fig. 9 demonstrates that ZOPOGPT significantly outperforms other baselines, achieving the best performance in 10 out of the 20 tasks as shown in Tab. 1. Specifically,ZOPOGPT achieves significantly higher accuracy on some challenging tasks such assecond_word_letter and sentence_similarity (see the accuracy gap ‚àÜ2 = 22.0 and 23.3 in Tab. 1), which we attribute to the high-quality of prompt candidates generated by ChatGPT. This is also consistent with our discussion on the input domain in Sec. 3.2. Here we could not draw a direct comparison between ZOPO and ZOPOGPT, as the Vicuna last token embedding is specifically associated with the prompt generation process in ZOPO and cannot be applied to ZOPOGPT. However, using either ZOPO or ZOPOGPT is sufficient to outperform baseline methods, which also provides the flexibility of prompt optimization in practice. Future research may consider employing better embeddings to further improve the performance of ZOPOGPT. 5.2 Improving Chain-of-Thought prompt The hand-crafted prompt ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think step by step‚Äù Kojima et al. (2022) (denoted as hand-craft) has been shown effective in improving LLMs‚Äô zero-shot multi-step reasoning performance. We show that ZOPO can find a better chain-of-thought prompt across different arithmetic reasoning tasks, as evidenced in Table 2. Particularly, ZOPO produces a better prompt ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs find the solution by using the given information.‚Äù on GSM8K compared to other baselines, improving the performance from 71.8 (hand-craft) to 75.4. Refer to Appx. B.4 for more experimental details. 9Table 2: The performance of the best zero-shot CoT prompt found by different methods on three reasoning tasks.

Verifying the Essence of Input Domain. To fairly validate the importance of input domain on prompt generation, we compare the optimization performances with different prompts generated by Vicuna-13B and ChatGPT respectively, using the same embedding model SBERT (i.e., h(¬∑)). The result is shown in Table. 4 in Appx. C.3, with the performance profile in Fig. 11 suggesting that applying ZOPO on ChatGPT-generated prompts is better. We ascribe its better performance to ChatGPT‚Äôs remarkable prompt generation ability. This confirms the importance of the input domain on prompt generation in our Insight II. Besides, different embeddings (i.e., Z) of the same prompt candidates can potentially affect the function landscape as shown in Fig. 4. Thus, we need to study the performance of ZOPO using different embedding representations given the same set of prompts. We consider four different embeddings here: the last token embedding from Vicuna-13B, the OpenAI embedding provided through an API (OpenAI, 2024b), the SBERT embedding, and a randomly projected embedding baseline. We observe from Tab. 5 in Appx. C.3 that, although last token embedding is generally better, there are certain tasks that OpenAI and SBERT embeddings perform equally well or better. Besides, random embedding shows a distinct lesser performance. This again highlights the importance of using more structured embeddings for prompt optimization and indicates the optimal choice of embedding can be task-dependent. Study of NTK-GP and uncertainty-informed local exploration.Further experiments are conducted to validate the algorithmic design of NTK-GP (in Sec. 4.2) and uncertainty-informed local exploration (in Sec. 4.3) of ZOPO. We aim to precisely assess the individual contributions of these components by comparing two variations of the original ZOPO algorithm: (a) one with replacing the NTK component with Mat√©rn kernel (as in ZoRD), and (b) another with the uncertainty-informed local exploration feature removed. The two variations are compared against the original ZOPO on the instruction induction tasks, with results shown in Tab. 6 in Appx. C.4. The superior performance of the original ZOPO demonstrates clear insights into the significance of each component in the overall performance of ZOPO. Additional Results. We also perform an ablation study to examine the impact of a larger size of the generated prompt candidates (i.e., |V|) on ZOPO and ZOPOGPT in Appx. C.5, which suggests a relatively small set of strong prompt candidates (e.g., |V| = 500) is sufficient (compared with size 1000 or 2000). Additionally, we provide more demonstrations of our empirical findings in Sec. 3 on other tasks in Appx. C.1, which is consistent with our findings. 106 Related Work Soft Prompt Tuning. To control LLMs to perform specific downstream tasks (e.g., reasoning), soft prompt tuning (Li & Liang, 2021) is usually used as a lightweight method to fine-tune the LLMs by only optimizing a continuous vector prepended to the input tokens using gradient descent. However, when the gradient information of the model is inaccessible, gradient-free prompt tuning methods Sun et al. (2022b,a); Diao et al. (2023) are developed to alleviate human efforts in prompt design. However, those efforts to optimize the task-specific soft prompts have conventionally relied on the white-box access to the embedding layers of LLMs, making it inapplicable to state-of-the-art LLMs like ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2024a) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) that can only be accessed through black-box APIs (i.e., only accept natural language as input). Discrete Prompt Optimization. We refer to the process of optimizing discrete prompts as ‚Äúprompt optimization\", which is also a more practical setting as black-box LLMs only accept discrete inputs. Reinforcement learning-based methods (Deng et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023) focus on discrete token optimization but rely on the output distribution of the LLMs, which is not accessible in black-box API LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT). Zhou et al. (2023) instead makes use of LLMs to produce promising candidate prompts through resampling without applying specific optimizations. The recent work of Guo et al. (2024) further extends this model-free approach to evolutionary algorithms and proposes EvoPrompt to optimize prompts through iterative mutation and crossover. However, these methods typically require a large number of iterations and queries to perform well. In this regard, InstructZero Chen et al. (2023) leverages the induction ability from other white-box LLM g(¬∑) for the generation of task-specific prompts, that is v = g([s, Ddemo]) conditioned on a continuous soft prompt s ‚àà Rd and in-context demonstrations Ddemo. After that, the optimization on v can be transformed into an optimization on the soft prompt s, where BO algorithms are employed for a global black-box optimization. INSTINCT (Lin et al., 2023) further employs neural bandit algorithms and the last token embeddings from the white-box LLM to further improve the prompt optimization performance. However, these works prioritize a global optimization approach that emphasizes the exploration of the entire space. With an empirical understanding of the underlying target function (i.e., the black-box API LLMs), we propose a localized ZOO method that is in contrast to the global optimization approaches. 7 Conclusion In this work, we first provide a thorough empirical study to understand the characteristics of the target function, and then propose our ZOPO algorithm for prompt optimization. Specifically, ZOPO embraces a ZOO approach in pursuit of finding local optima efficiently. Extensive experiments on 30 instruction induction tasks and 3 reasoning tasks demonstrate the efficacy of ZOPO, and ablation studies also validate the design principles of ZOPO. Besides, we propose a domain transformation that connects powerful LLMs with remarkable embedding models, which provides the flexibility of choices of input domains in prompt optimization. This may inspire future research in optimizing prompts with powerful embeddings. 11References Arora, S., Du, S. S., Hu, W., Li, Z., Salakhutdinov, R., and Wang, R.

To begin with, we first introduce the following lemmas adapted from (Shu et al., 2023a): Lemma A.1 (Thm. 1 in (Shu et al., 2023a)). Let Œ¥ ‚àà (0, 1) and œâ ‚âú d + 2( ‚àö d + 1) ln(1/Œ¥). For any z ‚àà Zand any t ‚â• 1, the following holds with probability of at least 1 ‚àí Œ¥, \r\r\r‚àá eF(z) ‚àí ¬µt(z) \r\r\r 2 ‚â§ œâ \r\rŒ£2 t (z) \r\r . Lemma A.2 (Lemma B.4 in (Shu et al., 2023a)). For any z ‚àà Zand any t ‚â• 1, the following holds \r\rŒ£2 t (z) \r\r ‚â§ \r\rŒ£2 t‚àí1(x) \r\r . Proof of Prop. 1. Recall that the covariance function (refer to(4)) of our derived NTK-GP conditioned on the history of function queries Dt ‚âú {(zœÑ , rœÑ )}t œÑ=1 of size t will be Œ£2 t (z) = k‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(z, z) ‚àí kt(z)‚ä§ \u0000 Kt + œÉ2I \u0001‚àí1 kt(z) . (7) For any c ‚àà R and z ‚àà Z, define Nz,Œ≤ ‚âú {z‚Ä≤ ‚àà {zœÑ }t œÑ=1 | ‚à•‚àÇzk(z, z‚Ä≤)‚à•2 ‚â• Œ≤} with |Nz,Œ≤| = N, the following then holds on the set Nz,Œ≤: \r\rkN (z)‚ä§kN (z) \r\r (a) ‚â• 1 d tr \u0000 kN (z)‚ä§kN (z) \u0001 (b) = 1 d tr \u0000 kN (z)kN (z)‚ä§\u0001 (c) = 1 d NX n=1 ‚à•‚àÇzk(z, z‚Ä≤)‚à•2 (d) ‚â• NŒ≤ d (8) where (a) comes from the fact the maximum eigenvalue of a matrix is always larger or equal to its averaged eigenvalues, (b) is based on tr(AB) = tr(BA), (c) is from the definition of kN (z), and (d) results from the definition of Nz,Œ≤. Meanwhile, Œ£2 t (z) (a) ‚âº k‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(z, z) ‚àí kN (z)‚ä§ \u0000 KN + œÉ2I \u0001‚àí1 kN (z) (b) ‚âº Œ∫I ‚àí \u0000 Œªmax (KN ) + œÉ2\u0001‚àí1 kN (z)‚ä§kN (z) (c) ‚âº Œ∫I ‚àí kN (z)‚ä§kN (z) NŒ± + œÉ2 (d) ‚âº \u0012 Œ∫ ‚àí NŒ≤/d NŒ± + œÉ2 \u0013 I (9) where (a) comes from Lemma A.2, (b) is based on the assumption of ‚à•k‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(z, z)‚à• ‚â§Œ∫ and the defi- nition of maximum eigenvalue. In addition, (c) comes from Œªmax(KN ) ‚â§ N maxz,z‚Ä≤‚ààNz,Œ≤ k(z, z‚Ä≤) (i.e., the Gershgorin theorem) and the assumption that k(z, z‚Ä≤) ‚â§ Œ± for any z, z‚Ä≤ ‚àà Z, and (d) is based on the results in (8). Finally, by introducing the results above into Lemma A.1, we conclude the proof. 14Appendix B Details of Experimental Settings B.1 Evaluation Metrics Following previous works Zhou et al. (2023); Lin et al. (2023), we use the F1 score for tasks including common_concept and informal_to_formal; we use the exact set matching fororthography_starts_with and taxonomy_animal; we use the set containing for synonyms; we use the exact matching metric for the rest of instruction induction tasks; and we use the accuracy metric for the arithmetic reasoning datasets. As the number of datasets is tremendous, we use the performance profile Dolan & Mor√© (2002) as the evaluation metric that measures the frequency (i.e., œÅ(œÑ)) of a method within some distance (i.e., œÑ) from the optimality achieved by any method, defined below œÅm(œÑ) = 1 |Œ†| |{œÄ ‚àà Œ† : r‚àó œÄ ‚àí rœÄ,m ‚â§ œÑ}| (10) where Œ† is the set of all tasks, rœÄ,m is the accuracy of method m on task œÄ, and r‚àó œÄ = max{rœÄ,m : ‚àÄm ‚àà M}is the best performance achieved by any method in M on task œÄ. Specifically, œÅ(0) represents the number of tasks where a method achieves the best performance. Accordingly, we use both œÅ(0) and œÅ(5) as the evaluation indicators in our tables to report the results. B.2 Hyperparameters For all experiments using ZOPO in this work, we set the learning rate to 0.01, the uncertainty thresholds Œª, Œæto 0.1 and 5 respectively, and the number n of nearest neighbors to query in local exploration (Section 4.3) to 10. A neural network with 2 fully connected layers of size 32 and ReLU activation functions is used in NTK-GP as the kernel. We use 20 nearest neighbors to fit the NTK-GP. B.3 instruction induction In this subsection, we describe the experimental details of the instruction induction tasks. B.3.1 Experimental Specifications The same data partition and evaluation process as in previous works Zhou et al. (2023); Chen et al. (2023); Lin et al. (2023) is adopted in this work, where, for each task, we optimize the generated prompt on a training set D, and report the best-performing prompt‚Äôs inference accuracy on a held-out test set DT . Specifically, 5 examples are sampled from the training set as the demonstrations (i.e., Ddemo) for instruction induction, and another sampled 20 examples from the training set are used as the validation set DV to evaluate the objective function value as in Equation (1). The total query budget for each instruction induction task is fixed at 165 for all methods. B.3.2 Implementation Details To comprehensively compare with the baseline methods, we use GPT-3.5-turbo-0301 (supported by OpenAI API) as the black-box model for prompt evaluation and Vicuna-13B-v1.1 as the white-box LLM (i.e., g(¬∑)) to generate the task-specific prompts by feeding g(¬∑) with randomly sampled soft prompts and Ddemo, which is the same as InstructZero and INSTINCT. In the experiments, we only generate 500 prompt candidates for ZOPO (i.e., |V| = 500). Similarly, we also use 40 out of the 165 queries for random initialization of our optimization method, which could serve as the only global exploration of the function landscape at the beginning of local optimization. To tackle the high dimensionality of soft prompt (i.e., 5120 for one token embedding as in Vicuna-13B) in optimization, InstructZero and INSTINCT use random projection to project the soft prompt into a much smaller intrinsic dimension (e.g., 100). This intrinsic dimension may empirically affect the quality of generated prompts, as shown in Lin et al. (2023). Therefore, tuning the intrinsic dimension and the soft token length could lead to better performance. Previous methods (i.e., InstructZero and INSTINCT) perform a grid search over the intrinsic dimension in {50, 100, 200} and the soft token length {3, 5, 10} on the validation set and report the accuracy on a held-out test set using the best prompt found using the validation set. We also adopt this technique in ZOPO for fair comparison. 15The soft prompt will be concatenated with the tokenized embedding of the prompt generation template to generate task-specific prompt from Vicuna-13B. The prompt generation template and the prompt evaluation template are shown below in the bounding boxes. Prompt Generation Template (Soft Prompt) Input: ‚ü®INPUT‚ü© Output: ‚ü®OUTPUT‚ü© Input: ‚ü®INPUT‚ü© Output: ‚ü®OUTPUT‚ü© Input: ‚ü®INPUT‚ü© Output: ‚ü®OUTPUT‚ü© Input: ‚ü®INPUT‚ü© Output: ‚ü®OUTPUT‚ü© Input: ‚ü®INPUT‚ü© Output: ‚ü®OUTPUT‚ü© The prompt was to? Evaluation Template prompt: ‚ü®prompt (i.e., v)‚ü© Input: ‚ü®TEST INPUT‚ü© Output: We directly use the reported results of APE, IntructZero, and INSTINCT from Lin et al. (2023) for comparison, and we report the results of EvoPrompt with our re-implementation. For a fair comparison, we also use Vicuna-13B for generating the initial prompt population (of size 20) for EvoPrompt, and we use GPT-3.5 turbo to perform the genetic algorithm in EvoPrompt and generate its new prompts. Using GPT-3.5 turbo to generate new prompts will help improve EvoPrompt‚Äôs performance, as compared with using the relatively smaller model Vicuna-13B. B.3.3 Experimental Details on Query Efficiency To facilitate a more comprehensive comparison of different prompt optimization methods at different query budget scales, we set the maximum query budget to 200, and report the test accuracy of the best prompt found on the validation set with each incremental query budget, as shown in Fig. 5 in the main text. We report the mean accuracy and standard error, using 3 runs with different random seeds. For InstructZero, INSTINCT, and ZOPO, we directly fix the intrinsic dimension for generating the soft prompt as 10 and the number of soft tokens as 5, without using the validation set to perform a grid search over the intrinsic dimension and the number of soft tokens. ChatGPT Prompt Generation Template I gave a friend an prompt.

We follow the generation template from APE Zhou et al. (2023), as shown above, to generate task-specific prompts from ChatGPT. To generate various prompts using the APE method, we need to sample different sets of demonstrations (i.e., Ddemo) from the training set, and, for each Ddemo, we also need to randomly sample from the ChatGPT‚Äôs response by setting a high temperature (e.g., 0.95). To maintain the same size of prompt candidates as in the previous experimental setting of ZOPO, we also generate 500 prompt candidates for each instruction induction task. To harness the representation power of existing embedding models, we adopt the sentence transformer model Reimers & Gurevych (2019) ‚Äúall-mpnet-base-v2‚Äù from HuggingFace to generate the high-dimensional sentence embedding for each generated prompt from ChatGPT. B.4 Improving Chain-of-Thought Prompt To improve the zero-shot chain-of-thought prompt performance on arithmetic reasoning tasks, we make use of the LLM‚Äôs induction ability and enable LLMs to generate different chain-of-thought prompt candidates by providing some example chain-of-thought prompts. We consider the evaluation of our method on three arithmetic reasoning datasets (i.e., GSM8K, AQUARAT, SV AMP). Similar as APE Zhou et al. (2023), we use all data from the test set for GSM8K and AQUARAT, and we sample 400 data points from AQUARAT‚Äôs test set to evaluate the corresponding test accuracy. For all these three datasets, we sample 200 data points from their training dataset respectively as their individual validation dataset. We follow the experimental setting of Lin et al. (2023): use the soft prompt to generate prompts from Vicuna-13B with a fixed intrinsic dimension of 1000 and search the soft token length {3, 5, 10} on the validation set. The corresponding prompt generation template is given below. See Tab. 2 for details on the performance of ZOPO against other baselines on the three reasoning tasks. Prompt Generation Template for Chain-of-Thought I have some prompt examples for solving school math problems. prompt: Let‚Äôs figure it out! prompt: Let‚Äôs solve the problem. prompt: Let‚Äôs think step by step. Write your new prompt that is different from the examples to solve the school math problems. prompt: 17Appendix C Additional Results C.1 Extended Empirical Study on Function Landscape In Section 3, we have empirically studied the landscape of the target function and incorporated the findings into the design of ZOPO. In the main text, we have demonstrated the results on three in- struction induction datasets, including taxonomy_animal, cause_and_effect, and informal_to_formal. Here we use more datasets to validate our findings. Due to the large size of instruction induction tasks (i.e., 30 tasks in total) and the query budget limit (i.e., it incurs monetary costs when we query the objective function ChatGPT to evaluate the prompt on the given task), we only experiment with few more randomly chosen tasks here to further validate our findings. C.1.1 Local Optima vs. Global Optimum To validate our local optimization design, we study the local optima in the function landscape, by using a 3-dimensional (reduced by t-SNE) scatter plot to represent the prompt embeddings (last token embeddings from Vicuna-13B). Here we provide the empirical results on more instruction induction tasks, shown in Fig. 6. The heatmap color represents the validation accuracy of the corresponding prompt. This allows us to interpret the local optima visually, and we conclude that many local optima can already exhibit compelling performance. word_sorting  sentiment  synonyms  singular_to_plural  common_concept 0.0 0.5 1.0 Figure 6: The validation accuracy of 300 randomly sampled prompts with the last token representation on various tasks. C.1.2 Essense of Input Domain Prompt Generation To study the prompt quality of different prompt generation methods, we compare the prompts generated from Vicuna-13B and those generated from ChatGPT (i.e., GPT 3.5 turbo). For Vicuna-13B, we use the randomly sampled soft prompts with a fixed intrinsic dimension of 200 and a number token length of 10. For ChatGPT, we randomly sample prompts from the ChatGPT‚Äôs response by using the APE generation template filled with random example demonstrations. For each generation method on each task, we generate 300 random prompts, and we query the target function with all prompts. We show the validation accuracy distribution of prompts generated by the two methods on four more (due to budget constraints) tasks here in Fig. 7. It demonstrates that ChatGPT has a larger probability of generating prompts with higher accuracy, also with a larger mean. The result shows that ChatGPT-generated prompts are generally better, further validating our finding of the importance of the input domain. 0.0 0.2 0 5 10Probability Density auto_categorization 0.0 0.5 1 2 negation 0 1 0 5 10 singular_to_plural 0.0 0.5 0 2 4 synonyms Validation Accuracy Vicuna-13B ChatGPT Figure 7: The estimated accuracy distribution of prompts generated by Vicuna-13B or ChatGPT on various instruction induction tasks, where the vertical dotted line indicates the mean performance. Prompt Embedding The complexity of modeling the target function depends on its function landscape defined by the embedding domain. To empirically analyze the black-box target function, 18we show the accuracy landscape of different tasks, where we reduce the dimension of the prompt embedding (we use the last token embedding of Vicuna-13B here) to 2 by using t-SNE. The loss landscape is visualized in the surface plot shown in Fig. 8. We observe that different optimization methods achieve similar performances on tasks like sentiment and singular_to_plural, as they have many good local optima. For other challenging tasks with complex function landscapes, the good local optima are less, but our methods can still achieve superior performance. This validates our insight that there are many good local optima in the embedding space. word_sorting 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.050.050.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.050.05 0.100.100.10 0.10 0.150.15 0.15 sentiment 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.00.0 0.0 0.0 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.10.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.30.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.30.3 0.30.3 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.40.4 0.4 0.4 0.40.4 0.40.4 0.4 0.5 0.50.5 0.5 0.50.5 0.50.5 0.5 0.50.5 0.5 0.60.6 0.60.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.60.6 0.6 0.70.7 0.7 0.7 0.70.7 0.70.7 0.7 0.8 0.8 0.80.8 synonyms 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.06 0.06 0.06 0.06 0.06 0.06 0.06 0.120.12 0.12 0.12 0.12 0.12 0.18 0.18 0.18 0.24 singular_to_plural 0.0 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.20.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.20.2 0.3 0.30.30.3 0.3 0.3 0.30.3 0.30.3 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.40.4 0.40.4 0.40.4 0.5 0.5 0.50.5 0.50.5 0.5 0.50.50.5 0.5 0.50.5 0.50.5 0.50.5 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.60.6 0.6 0.60.6 0.60.6 0.60.6 0.6 0.60.6 0.6 0.6 0.7 0.7 0.70.7 0.70.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.70.7 0.7 0.70.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.80.8 0.8 0.90.9 0.9 common_concept 0.000 0.000 0.015 0.015 0.015 0.015 0.015 0.015 0.015 0.015 0.015 0.030 0.030 0.0300.030 0.045 0.0 0.5 1.0 Figure 8: The function surfaces on various tasks using the last token embedding from Vicuna-13B as the representation for prompt candidates that are generated by Vicuna-13B, with contour plots shown below. 19C.2 Comparison on Instruction Induction Tasks In Section 5.1 of the main text, we compared our methods with other baselines on 20 challenging instruction induction tasks.

For the prompt generation process, we fix the number of prompt candidates for both methods to 500. The result of the comparison on 20 instruction induction tasks is shown in Table. 4, where the corresponding performance profile shown in Fig. 11 suggests that applying ZOPO on ChatGPT-generated prompts is better than applying it on Vicuna-generated prompts.

We first generate a fixed set of prompts of size 500 from Vicuna-13B as those in Tab. 1. For the same set of prompts, we consider four different embeddings here: (a) the Last Token embedding from Vicuna-13B (b) the OpenAI embedding obtained through its embedding model ‚Äútext-embedding-ada- 002\" API. (OpenAI, 2024b), (c) the SBERT embedding obtained through the sentence transformer (‚Äúall-mpnet-base-v2‚Äù from HuggingFace), and (d) the Random embedding obtained by randomly projecting the Vicuna embedding into the same dimension. The dimensions of the four embeddings (from (a) to (d)) are 1536, 756, and 5120 respectively. We compare the optimization performance of the four embeddings using ZOPO and the results are shown in Tab. 5. We observe although last token embedding is generally better, there are certain tasks that OpenAI and SBERT embeddings perform equally well or better, which indicates the optimal choice of embedding can be task-dependent. Intuitively, random embedding is not representative. Its lesser performance shown in Tab. 5 again confirms our Insight II in Sec. 3.2, which says the choice of embedding/input domain is important in prompt optimization. 22Table 5: Average test accuracy with standard error (3 runs) for the best prompt found by ZOPO with four different embeddings on 20 instruction induction tasks.

Specifically, we (a) replace the NTK component with Mat√©rn kernel (as in the recent ZOO method ZoRD), and (b) remove the uncertainty-informed local exploration feature. We evaluate the two settings on 20 instruction induction tasks.

As our optimization method ZOPO is operated under a given set of prompt candidates, we here conduct an ablation study to examine the impact of a larger size of the generated prompt candidates (i.e., |V|) on the optimization performance. For ZOPO, we use random soft prompts to feed Vicuna-13B and generate prompts until V = 500 or V = 2000. We compare the optimization results of ZOPO using the two different sizes of prompts, and the results are shown in Table 7. We also follow the APE generation template to prompt ChatGPT to generate different sizes of prompt candidates and use SBERT to produce their embeddings. For ChatGPT-generated prompts in ZOPOGPT, we also consider two settings, V = 500 or V = 1000 (due to budget constraint). The corresponding result is shown in Table 8. We observe from the two tables that a larger set of prompt candidates may not necessarily lead to strictly better performance, and generating a relatively small set of strong prompt candidates (e.g., of size 500) is already good enough when we aim to find the optimal prompt.

Table 9: The best prompts discovered by our method ZOPO for every instruction induction task, where ‚Äú*‚Äù indicates the best prompt is found by ZOPOGPT for that task. Task Best prompt active_to_passive The prompt was to convert the given sentence into passive voice. antonyms The prompt was to rewrite the given words into their opposite meaning. So, ‚Äúhumor- less\" becomes ‚Äúhumorous\", ‚Äúdepressing\" becomes ‚Äúcheerful\", ‚Äúunwrap\" becomes ‚Äúwrap\", ‚Äúconsumptive\" becomes ‚Äúgenerative\", ‚Äúuncoil\" becomes ‚Äúcoil\". auto_categorization The prompt was to input the given names and output the corresponding apparel. For example, the input ‚ÄúNature Nanotechnology, Annual Review of Biochemistry, and The Lancet Neurology\" would output as ‚Äútop journals\". auto_debugging The prompt was to write a program that would take the given input and output the expected output. For example, the first input was a simple calculation, and the expected output was ‚Äú2550\". The second input was a class definition with a method, and the expected output was ‚Äú5\". cause_and_effect The prompt was to identify the sentence that is the cause and the sentence that is the effect in each pair of sentences. The input sentences are given, and the output is the cause sentence. common_concept The prompt was to create a series of pairs of inputs and outputs, where the outputs are related to the inputs in some way. For example, the inputs ‚Äúguitars\" and ‚Äúpendulums\" are related to the output of ‚Äúinvolve oscillations. diff The prompt was to subtract the second number from the first number. For example, the first input would be 41 and the second input would be 13, so the output would be 28 (41 - 13). The same process would be applied for the other inputs and outputs. first_word_letter The prompt was to create a program that takes a single input (a word representing a legal concept or term) and outputs a corresponding letter of the alphabet that represents that concept or term. For example, if the input is ‚Äúyear\", the program should output ‚Äúy\". informal_to_formal* The prompt was to rephrase each input sentence using a more formal or polite language. larger_animal The prompt was to create a program that takes two input animals and outputs the animal that is bigger. The program uses the ‚Äú>=\" operator to compare the size of the first animal to the size of the second animal. If the first animal is bigger, the program outputs the first animal. letters_list The prompt was to create a program that takes a single word input (e.g. ‚Äúyear\") and outputs a concatenated string of letters and spaces that approximates the pronuncia- tion of that word (e.g. ‚Äúy e a r\"). negation The prompt was to flip the truth value of the input statements. For example, if the input statement is ‚ÄúCany Ash and Robert Sakula are both Architects,\" the output should be ‚ÄúCany Ash and Robert Sakula are not Architects. num_to_verbal The prompt was to write a program that takes a number as input and outputs the number in words, using the appropriate number formatting. The examples provided in the input show the expected output for each number. object_counting The prompts were to provide the output of a given input, where the input is a list of items and the output is a number representing the total count of those items. The examples given in the prompt show how the prompts should be used to generate the desired output. odd_one_out* The prompt was to identify the word that is most different from the others in the group. 26orthography_starts_with* The prompt was to identify the first word that begins with a specific letter in each sentence. periodic_elements The prompts were to write a program that takes an input value and outputs the corresponding element name based on that value. For example, if the input is 24, the program would output ‚Äúchromium. rhymes The prompts were to create a program that takes in a word as input and outputs a related word based on a specific set of rules. The rules are as follows: If the input word starts with ‚Äútri\", the output should be ‚Äúslip\". second_word_letter* The prompt was to ‚ÄúIdentify and return the second letter of the input word\". sentence_similarity* The prompt was to create two different sentences that have similar meanings but are not identical. The output of each input-output pair indicates how closely the two sentences match in terms of meaning. Explanation of outputs: - 5 - perfectly: The two sentences are very similar in meaning and can be considered as equivalent. - 3 - probably: The two sentences have some similarities in meaning but there are also some differences, making it less certain that they are equivalent. - 2 - possibly: The two sentences have some similarities but also significant differences, making it unlikely that they are equivalent. - 1 - probably not: The two sentences have very different meanings and are unlikely to be considered as equivalent. - 0 - definitely not: The two sentences have no similarity in meaning and cannot be considered as equivalent. sentiment The prompt was to classify the given reviews as positive or negative based on the given input and output. The output is positive when the review is positive, and negative when the review is negative. singular_to_plural The prompt was to convert the input words to their plural form by adding ‚Äús\" to the end of the word. This was done by using the ‚Äúreplace\" function in Excel, which allows you to replace a specific text string with another text string. sum The prompt was to write a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs their sum as the result. The program uses the ‚Äòscanf‚Äò function to read the input numbers from the user, and the ‚Äòprintf‚Äò function to display the result. synonyms* The prompt was to create a list of words that are synonyms or closely related to the given word. taxonomy_animal* The prompt was to select all the animals in the input and output them in the order they appear. translation_en-de The prompts were to input various words and have the model generate the corre- sponding output in German. It appears that the model was successful in generating the desired output for each of the input words provided. If there are any additional prompts or clarification needed, please let me know. translation_en-es The prompts were to translate a set of words from Spanish to English using the provided translation table. translation_en-fr The prompt was to input a word and then output the corresponding word in French. It appears that the input and output words are being matched correctly, with the exception of the word ‚Äúinitiative,\" which should have the output ‚Äúinitiative\" in French, not ‚Äúenterprise. word_sorting* The prompt was to alphabetize the input list in ascending order and provide the resulting output as a list. word_unscrambling The prompt was to create a program that takes an input word and outputs the corresponding word with the letters rearranged in order. For example, given the input ‚Äúeccpat\", the program should output ‚Äúaccept\". 27",

Many optimization techniques are iterative: the optimization starts from an initial solution, then iteratively updates the solution to optimize the objective func- tion (Amari, 1993; Qian, 1999; Kingma & Ba, 2015; B√§ck & Schwefel, 1993; Rios & Sahinidis, 2013; Reeves, 1993). The optimization algorithm typically needs to be customized for an individual task to deal with the specific challenges posed by the decision space and the performance landscape, especially for derivative-free optimization. In this work, we propose Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to utilize large language models (LLMs) as optimizers. With the advancement of prompting techniques, LLMs have achieved impressive performance in various domains (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022a; Madaan et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023e). Their ability to understand natural language lays out a new possibility for optimization: instead of formally defining the optimization problem and deriving the update step with a programmed solver, we describe the optimization problem in natural language, then instruct the LLM to iteratively generate new solutions based on the problem description and the previously found solutions. Optimization with LLMs enables quick adaptation to different tasks by changing the problem description in the prompt, and the optimization process can be customized by adding instructions to specify the desired properties of the solutions. To demonstrate the potential of LLMs for optimization, we first present case studies on linear regression and the traveling salesman problem, which are two classic optimization problems that underpin many others in mathematical optimization, computer science, and operations research. On small-scale optimization problems, we show that LLMs are able to find good-quality solutions simply through prompting, and sometimes match or surpass hand-designed heuristic algorithms. Next, we demonstrate the ability of LLMs to optimize prompts: the goal is to find a prompt that maximizes the task accuracy. Specifically, we focus on natural language tasks where both the task input and output are texts. LLMs are shown to be sensitive to the prompt format (Zhao et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2023; Madaan & Yazdanbakhsh, 2022); in particular, semantically similar prompts may have drastically different performance (Kojima et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022b; Zhang et al., 2023), and the optimal prompt formats can be model-specific and task-specific (Ma et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023c). Therefore, prompt engineering is often important for LLMs to achieve good performance (Reynolds & McDonell, 2021). However, the large and discrete prompt space makes it challenging for optimization, especially when only API access to the LLM is available. Following prior work on continuous and discrete prompt optimization (Lester et al., 2021; Li & Liang, 2021; Zhou et al., 2022b; Pryzant et al., 2023), we assume a training set is available to compute the training accuracy as the objective value for optimization, and we show in experiments that optimizing the prompt for accuracy on a small training set is sufficient to reach high performance on the test set. The prompt to the LLM serves as a call to the optimizer, and we name it the meta-prompt. Figure 3 shows an example. The meta-prompt contains two core pieces of information. The first piece is previously generated prompts with their corresponding training accuracies. The second piece is the optimization problem description, which includes several exemplars randomly selected from the training set to exemplify the task of interest. We also provide instructions for the LLM to understand the relationships among different parts and the desired output format. Different from recent work on using LLMs for automatic prompt generation (Zhou et al., 2022b; Pryzant et al., 2023), each optimization step in our work generates new prompts that aim to increase the test accuracy based on a trajectory of previously generated prompts, instead of editing one input prompt according to natural language feedback (Pryzant et al., 2023) or requiring the new prompt to follow the same semantic meaning (Zhou et al., 2022b). Making use of the full optimization trajectory, OPRO enables the LLM to gradually generate new prompts that improve the task accuracy throughout the optimization process, where the initial prompts have low task accuracies. We conduct comprehensive evaluation on several LLMs, includingtext-bison and Palm 2-L in the PaLM-2 model family (Anil et al., 2023), as well asgpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 in the GPT model family. We optimize prompts on GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and Big-Bench Hard (Suzgun et al., 2022), which are reasoning benchmarks where prompting techniques have achieved remarkable performance breakthrough (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022; Suzgun et al., 2022). Starting from initial prompts with low task accuracies, we show that all LLMs in our evaluation are able to 2Large Language Models as Optimizers scores generated solutions LLM as optimizer objective function evaluator return top solutions when finish meta-prompt  solution-score pairs task description Figure 2: An overview of the OPRO framework. Given the meta-prompt as the input, the LLM generates new solutions to the objective function, then the new solutions and their scores are added into the meta-prompt for the next optimization step. The meta-prompt contains the solution-score pairs obtained throughout optimization, a natural language description of the task, and (in prompt optimization) a few task exemplars. Figure 3 shows a sample meta-prompt for prompt optimization. serve as optimizers, which consistently improve the performance of the generated prompts through iterative optimization until convergence (see Figure 1). In particular, while these LLMs generally produce instructions of different styles (see Table 1), with zero-shot prompting, their best generated instructions match the few-shot chain-of-thought prompting performance when applied to PaLM 2-L, outperforming the zero-shot performance with human-designed prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K. Additionally, we observe that the OPRO-optimized prompts transfer to other benchmarks of the same domain and also deliver notable performance gain. 2 OPRO: LLM AS THE OPTIMIZER Figure 2 illustrates the overall framework of OPRO. In each optimization step, the LLM generates candidate solutions to the optimization task based on the optimization problem description and previously evaluated solutions in the meta-prompt. Then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the meta-prompt for the subsequent optimization process. The optimization process terminates when the LLM is unable to propose new solutions with better optimization scores, or a maximum number of optimization steps has reached. We first outline the desired features of LLMs for optimization, then describe the key design choices based on these desirables. 2.1 D ESIRABLES OF OPTIMIZATION BY LLM S Making use of natural language descriptions. The main advantage of LLMs for optimization is their ability of understanding natural language, which allows people to describe their optimization tasks without formal specifications. For instance, in prompt optimization where the goal is to find a prompt that optimizes the task accuracy, the task can be described with a high-level text summary along with input-output examples. Trading off exploration and exploitation. The exploration-exploitation trade-off is a fundamental challenge in optimization, and it is important for LLMs serving as optimizers to balance these two competing goals. This means that the LLM should be able to exploit promising areas of the search space where good solutions are already found, while also exploring new regions of the search space so as to not miss potentially better solutions. 2.2 M ETA-PROMPT DESIGN As the input to the optimizer LLM, the meta-prompt contains the following two essential parts. Optimization problem description. The first part is the text description of the optimization problem, including the objective function and solution constraints. For example, for prompt optimization, the LLM can be instructed to ‚Äúgenerate a new instruction that achieves a higher accuracy‚Äù, and we denote such instructions in the meta-prompt as meta-instructions. We can also provide customized 3Large Language Models as Optimizers meta-instructions as an informal regularization of the generated solutions, such as ‚Äúthe instruction should be concise and generally applicable‚Äù. Optimization trajectory. Besides understanding natural language instructions, LLMs are also shown to be able to recognize patterns from in-context demonstrations (Wei et al., 2023; Madaan & Yazdanbakhsh, 2022; Mirchandani et al., 2023). Our meta-prompt makes use of this property and in- structs the LLM to leverage the optimization trajectory for generating new solutions. Specifically, the optimization trajectory includes past solutions and their optimization scores, sorted in the ascending order. Including optimization trajectory in the meta-prompt allows the LLM to identify similarities of solutions with high scores, encouraging the LLM to build upon existing good solutions to construct potentially better ones without the need of explicitly defining how the solution should be updated. 2.3 S OLUTION GENERATION At the solution generation step, the LLM generates new solutions with the meta-prompt as input. The following are the key optimization challenges we address in this stage. Optimization stability. In the optimization process, not all solutions achieve high scores and monotonically improve over prior ones. Due to the sensitivity of in-context learning to the prompt, LLM output can be drastically affected by low-quality solutions in the input optimization trajectory, especially at the beginning when the solution space has not been adequately explored. This sometimes results in optimization instability and large variance. To improve stability, we prompt the LLM to generate multiple solutions at each optimization step, allowing the LLM to simultaneously explore multiple possibilities and quickly discover promising directions to move forward. Exploration-exploitation trade-off. We tune the LLM sampling temperature to balance between exploration and exploitation. A lower temperature encourages the LLM to exploit the solution space around the previously found solutions and make small adaptations, while a high temperature allows the LLM to more aggressively explore solutions that can be notably different. 3 M OTIVATING EXAMPLE : M ATHEMATICAL OPTIMIZATION We first demonstrate the potential of LLMs in serving as optimizers for mathematical optimization. In particular, we present a case study on linear regression as an example of continuous optimization, and on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as an example of discrete optimization. On both tasks, we see LLMs properly capture the optimization directions on small-scale problems merely based on the past optimization trajectory provided in the meta-prompt. 3.1 L INEAR REGRESSION In linear regression problems, the goal is to find the linear coefficients that probabilistically best explain the response from the input variables. We study the setting in which the independent and dependent variables X and y are both one-dimensional and an intercept b is present, so that there are two one-dimensional variables w, b to optimize over. In a synthetic setting, we sample ground truth values for one-dimensional variables wtrue and btrue, and generate 50 data points by y = wtruex + btrue + œµ, in which x ranges from 1 to 50 and œµ is the standard Gaussian noise. Our optimization starts from 5 randomly sampled (w, b) pairs. In each step, we prompt an instruction- tuned LLM with a meta-prompt that includes the best 20 (w, b) pairs in history and their sorted objective values. The meta-prompt then asks for a new (w, b) pair that further decreases the objective value. A sample meta-prompt is shown in Figure 19 of Appendix C.1. We prompt the meta-prompt 8 times to generate at most 8 new (w, b) pairs in each step to improve optimization stability. Then we evaluate the objective value of the proposed pair and add it to history. We do black-box optimization: the analytic form does not appear in the meta-prompt text. This is because the LLM can often calculate the solution directly from the analytic form. Table 2 summarizes the results with one of the following optimizer LLMs: text-bison, gpt-3.5-turbo, and gpt-4. We study three settings of wtrue and btrue: within the starting region [10, 20] √ó [10, 20], ‚Äúnear outside‚Äù (each of wtrue and btrue is outside the starting region but the distance is less than 10), and ‚Äúfar outside‚Äù (each of wtrue and btrue is outside the starting region and the distance is greater than 10). We see: 4Large Language Models as Optimizers Table 2: Linear regression by optimizer LLMs: the mean ¬± standard deviation of the number of steps and the number of unique (w, b) pairs explored before reaching the global optima. Both w and b start from 5 random starting points in [10, 20]. We use temperature 1.0 for all models. We run each setting 5 times. The starting points are the same across optimizer LLMs but are different across 5 runs, and are grouped by: within the starting region, outside and close to the starting region, and outside and farther from the starting region.

The gpt-4 model also outperforms in finding the optima with fewer explored unique points. Taking a closer look at the optimization trajectory, we see gpt-4 is the best at proposing a reasonable next step from the history: for example, when the history shows the objective values of (w, b) = (8, 7), (w, b) = (8, 6), and (w, b) = (8, 5) are decreasing, it has a highest chance to propose (w, b) = (8, 4) for evaluation. ‚Ä¢ The problem becomes harder for all models when the ground truth moves farther from the starting region: all models need more explorations and more steps. 3.2 T RAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM (TSP) Next, we consider the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) (J√ºnger et al., 1995; Gutin & Punnen, 2006), a classical combinatorial optimization problem with numerous algorithms proposed in literature, including heuristic algorithms and solvers (Rosenkrantz et al., 1977; Golden et al., 1980; Optimization et al., 2020; Applegate et al., 2006; Helsgaun, 2017), and approaches based on training deep neural networks (Kool et al., 2019; Deudon et al., 2018; Chen & Tian, 2019; Nazari et al., 2018). Specifically, given a set of n nodes with their coordinates, the TSP task is to find the shortest route that traverses all nodes from the starting node and finally returns to the starting node. Our optimization process with LLMs starts from 5 randomly generated solutions, and each optimiza- tion step produces at most 8 new solutions. We present the meta-prompt in Figure 20 of Appendix C.1. We generate the problem instances by samplingn nodes with both x and y coordinates in [‚àí100, 100]. We use the Gurobi solver (Optimization et al., 2020) to construct the oracle solutions and compute the optimality gap for all approaches, where the optimality gap is defined as the difference between the distance in the solution constructed by the evaluated approach and the distance achieved by the oracle solution, divided by the distance of the oracle solution. Besides evaluating OPRO with different LLMs including text-bison, gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4, we also compare OPRO to the following heuristics: ‚Ä¢ Nearest Neighbor (NN). Starting from an initial node, the solution is constructed with the nearest neighbor heuristic: At each step, among the remaining nodes that are not included in the current partial solution, NN selects the node with the shortest distance to the end node of the partial solution, and adds it as the new end node. The process finishes when all nodes have been added to the solution. ‚Ä¢ Farthest Insertion (FI). One caveat of the nearest neighbor heuristic is that it does not take the distance between the start and end node into consideration when constructing partial solutions. To address this issue, FI aims to optimize the cost of inserting new nodes into the partial solution at each step. Define the minimal insertion cost of adding a new node k as 5Large Language Models as Optimizers Table 3: Results of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with different number of nodes n, where each n contains 5 problems. ‚Äú# steps‚Äù calculates the mean ¬± standard error of optimization steps for successful runs that find the optimal solution. ‚Äú# successes‚Äù counts the number of problems that OPRO results in the optimal solution.

At each step, FI adds a new node that maximizes the minimal insertion cost. We present the results in Table 3. We randomly generate 5 problem instances for each number of nodes n. In addition to measuring the optimality gap, on problems where the LLM finds the optimal solutions, we also show the number of optimization steps taken to reach the global optimum. First, we observe that gpt-4 significantly outperforms gpt-3.5-turbo and text-bison across all problem sizes. Specifically, on smaller-scale problems, gpt-4 reaches the global optimum about 4√ó faster than other LLMs. On larger-scale problems, especially withn = 50, gpt-4 still finds solutions with a comparable quality to heuristic algorithms, while both text-bison and gpt-3.5-turbo get stuck at local optima with up to 20√ó worse optimality gaps. On the other hand, the performance of OPRO degrades dramatically on problems with larger sizes. When n = 10, all LLMs find the optimal solutions for every evaluated problem; as the problem size gets larger, the OPRO optimality gaps increase quickly, and the farthest insertion heuristic starts to outperform all LLMs in the optimality gap. Limitations. We would like to note that OPRO is designed for neither outperforming the state- of-the-art gradient-based optimization algorithms for continuous mathematical optimization, nor surpassing the performance of specialized solvers for classical combinatorial optimization problems such as TSP. Instead, the goal is to demonstrate that LLMs are able to optimize different kinds of objective functions simply through prompting, and reach the global optimum for some small- scale problems. Our evaluation reveals several limitations of OPRO for mathematical optimization. Specifically, the length limit of the LLM context window makes it hard to fit large-scale optimization problem descriptions in the prompt, e.g., linear regression with high-dimensional data, and traveling salesman problems with a large set of nodes to visit. In addition, the optimization landscape of some objective functions are too bumpy for the LLM to propose a correct descending direction, causing the optimization to get stuck halfway. We further elaborate our observed failure cases in Appendix A. 4 A PPLICATION : P ROMPT OPTIMIZATION Next, we demonstrate the effectiveness of OPRO on prompt optimization, where the objective is to find the prompt that maximizes task accuracy. We first introduce the problem setup, then illustrate the meta-prompt design. 4.1 P ROBLEM SETUP We focus on prompt optimization for natural language tasks, where both the input and output are in the text format. The task is represented as a dataset with training and test splits, where the training set is used to calculate the training accuracy as the objective value during the optimization process, and we compute the test accuracy on the test set after the optimization finishes. While traditional optimization often requires a decently large training set, our experiment shows that a small number or fraction of training samples (e.g., 3.5% of the training set for GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), 20% for Big-Bench Hard (Suzgun et al., 2022)) is sufficient. The objective function evaluator is an LLM 6Large Language Models as Optimizers I have some texts along with their corresponding scores. The texts are arranged in ascending order based on their scores, where higher scores indicate better quality. text: Let‚Äôs figure it out! score: 61 text: Let‚Äôs solve the problem. score: 63 (. . . more instructions and scores . . . ) The following exemplars show how to apply your text: you replace <INS> in each input with your text, then read the input and give an output. We say your output is wrong if your output is different from the given output, and we say your output is correct if they are the same. input: Q: Alannah, Beatrix, and Queen are preparing for the new school year and have been given books by their parents. Alannah has 20 more books than Beatrix. Queen has 1/5 times more books than Alannah. If Beatrix has 30 books, how many books do the three have together? A: <INS> output: 140 (. . . more exemplars . . . ) Write your new text that is different from the old ones and has a score as high as possible. Write the text in square brackets.

The blue text contains solution-score pairs; the purple text describes the optimization task and output format; the orange text are meta-instructions. to which the optimized prompt will be applied, and it can be the same or different from the LLM for optimization. We denote the LLM for objective function evaluation as the scorer LLM, and the LLM for optimization as the optimizer LLM. The output of the optimizer LLM is an instruction, which is concatenated to the question part of every exemplar and prompts the scorer LLM. We consider the following positions to insert the instruction: ‚Ä¢ Q_begin: the instruction is added before the original question. ‚Ä¢ Q_end: the instruction is added after the original question. ‚Ä¢ A_begin: the instruction is added to the beginning of the scorer LLM output. This is applicable to pretrained LLMs without instruction tuning, where the prompt is formatted as a sequence of QA pairs. We exemplify these prompting formats in Appendix B. 4.2 M ETA-PROMPT DESIGN Figure 3 shows an example of the meta-prompt for prompt optimization on GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). More details are as follows. 7Large Language Models as Optimizers Optimization problem examples. The problem description includes a few examples taken from the training set to demonstrate the task for the generated instructions. For example, from the input-output pair in Figure 3, we can infer this is a math word problem. The input-output pair also demonstrates the position where the generated instruction will be added to, and this is essential for the optimizer LLM to generate instructions of the same style. In each optimization step, we add several (three for example) training examples to the meta-prompt by random sampling the training set or choose the ones the previous instructions fall short of. Optimization trajectory. The optimization trajectory includes instructions generated from the past optimization steps, along with their scores. The old instructions and scores are sorted by the score in ascending order. The score is the training accuracy in prompt optimization. We only keep instructions with the highest scores in the meta-prompt in consideration of the LLM context length limit. Meta-instructions. We also addmeta-instructions: the instructions to the optimizer LLM that explain the optimization goal and instruct the model how to use the above information. The meta-instructions may also specify the desired generated instruction format for easier parsing. 5 P ROMPT OPTIMIZATION EXPERIMENTS We present the evaluation results for prompt optimization in this section. Our experiments demonstrate that OPRO brings a significant performance gain across the board, with different combinations of LLMs as the optimizer and the scorer. Section 5.1 describes the experiment setup. Section 5.2 shows main results on reasoning tasks like GSM8K and BBH. Section 5.3 shows ablation studies. Section 5.4 analyzes overfitting in prompt optimization. Section 5.5 compares the prompt optimization performance of meta-prompts in OPRO and EvoPrompt (Guo et al., 2023). 5.1 E VALUATION SETUP Models. The LLMs we use as the optimizer and the scorer are: ‚Ä¢ Optimizer LLM: Pre-trained PaLM 2-L (Anil et al., 2023), instruction-tuned PaLM 2-L (denoted PaLM 2-L-IT), text-bison, gpt-3.5-turbo, and gpt-4. ‚Ä¢ Scorer LLM: Pre-trained PaLM 2-L and text-bison. With pre-trained PaLM 2-L as the scorer, the optimizer LLM generates A_begin instructions. Since text-bison has been instruction-tuned, the optimizer LLM generates Q_begin and Q_end instructions when text-bison is used as the scorer. Benchmarks. Our primary evaluation benchmarks are GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and Big-Bench Hard (BBH) (Suzgun et al., 2022). GSM8K is a benchmark of grade school math word problems with 7,473 training samples and 1,319 test samples, where chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022) and the zero-shot instruction ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think step by step.‚Äù (Kojima et al., 2022) have drastically improved the performance over the standard prompting. BBH is a suite of 23 challenging BIG-Bench tasks (Srivastava et al., 2022) that covers a wide range of topics beyond arithmetic reasoning, including symbolic manipulation and commonsense reasoning. Each task contains up to 250 examples in total. To examine the transferability of the optimized instructions, we also evaluate the instructions op- timized for GSM8K on two other mathematical reasoning datasets, i.e., MultiArith (Roy & Roth, 2016) and AQuA (Ling et al., 2017). Implementation details. We set the temperature to be 0 when evaluating the performance of generated instructions, in which case the scorer LLM greedily decodes. Unless otherwise specified, we set the default temperature to be 1.0 for optimizer LLMs to generate diverse and creative instructions. At each optimization step, we prompt the optimizer LLM with the meta-prompt 8 times to generate 8 instructions, then we add these instructions with their training scores to the optimization trajectory in the meta-prompt. Our meta-prompt at each step contains the best 20 instructions so far and 3 randomly picked exemplars from the training set. We study the effect of different hyperparameters in ablation studies (Section 5.3). Appendix C.2 presents the full meta-prompts for different optimizer LLMs. 8Large Language Models as Optimizers Table 4: Test accuracies on GSM8K.

Round off by ensuring your solution fits the context of the problem to ensure accuracy. 62.7 5.2 M AIN RESULTS We show prompt optimization curves on GSM8K and two BBH tasks in this section. The curves on other BBH tasks are deferred to Appendix D, and the tables containing all accuracy numbers are in Appendix E. 5.2.1 GSM8K For prompt optimization, we randomly sample 3.5% examples from the GSM8K training set. The same subset is used throughout optimization, so that the task accuracies computed at intermediate optimization steps are approximations of the training accuracy on all 7,473 training examples. This balances the evaluation cost with the generalization performance. After the optimization procedure finishes, we evaluate the found instructions on the entire GSM8K test set. Figure 1(a) in Section 1 shows prompt optimization curves with pre-trained PaLM 2-L as scorer and PaLM 2-L-IT as optimizer, and the initial instruction is ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs solve the problem‚Äù with a (approximated, and same below) training accuracy of 60.5. We observe that the optimization curve shows an overall upward trend with several leaps throughout the optimization process, for example: 9Large Language Models as Optimizers ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think carefully about the problem and solve it together.‚Äù at Step 2 with the training accuracy 63.2; ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs break it down!‚Äù at Step 4 with training accuracy 71.3; ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs calculate our way to the solution!‚Äù at Step 5 with training accuracy 73.9; ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do the math!‚Äù at Step 6 with training accuracy 78.2. The optimization curves also generally show a decrease of the variance among the accuracies of instructions generated at each step, indicating that the optimizer LLM generates distributionally better instructions throughout the optimization. Next, we present the results of generating Q_begin instructions with the text-bison scorer and the PaLM 2-L-IT optimizer, starting from an empty instruction with a 57.1 training accuracy. The optimization curve in Figure 4(a) shows a similar upward trend, during which a few leaps in the training accuracy include: ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúSolve the following problems using the given information.‚Äù at Step 2 with training accuracy 59.8; ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúSolve the following problems by applying the given information and using the appropriate mathematical operations.‚Äù at Step 3 with training accuracy 64.0; ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs read the problem carefully and identify the given information. Then, we can create an equation and solve for the unknown variable.‚Äù at Step 4 with training accuracy 67.0; ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always down for solving a math word problem together. Just give me a moment to read and understand the problem. Then, I‚Äôll create an equation that models the problem, which I‚Äôll solve for the unknown variable. I also may or may not use some helpful diagrams or visuals to understand the problem. Lastly, be sure to allow me some time to carefully check my work before submitting any responses!‚Äù at Step 29 with training accuracy 70.1. Note that although our default setting is to run OPRO for 200 steps in prompt optimization, we need much fewer steps if the goal is to find some outstanding instructions. An example is that the Figure 1(a) experiment found ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do the math!‚Äù at Step 6 with training accuracy 78.2, almost matching the ‚ÄúTake a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.‚Äù found at the 107th step with training accuracy 80.2, at a point where the optimization curve is still trending upwards. This is because a leap in our optimization curve does not always correspond to a much better instruction being discovered; instead, it can be due to a large qualitative improvement of all 8 generated instructions in this step. The latter usually happens several steps after the former: after a much better instruction is discovered in one step, the meta-prompt gradually gets rid of worse instructions in the latter steps by generating instructions similar to the much-better one. The top instructions kept in the meta-prompt gradually improves in this procedure. At a point when the meta-prompt only triggers higher quality instructions, the leap happens. Finally, Figure 4(b) shows that the pre-trained PaLM 2-L can also serve as the optimizer LLM and improve its own prediction performance. Different from other optimizer LLMs that are instruction- tuned, the pre-trained PaLM 2-L performs better when the prompt is formatted in a few-shot manner. Therefore, we include two initial instructions to start the optimization: the empty instruction (with a training accuracy 32.2) and ‚ÄúThe answer is‚Äù (with a training accuracy 33.3). See Figure 21 in Appendix C for the meta-prompt format. The generated instructions follow the same style as ‚ÄúThe answer is‚Äù: most instructions are also phrases suitable as the prefix of a sentence, like ‚ÄúHere you go:‚Äù (generated at Step 11 with training accuracy 61.3) and ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do it:‚Äù (generated at Step 13 with training accuracy 75.1). Table 4 summarizes top instructions found on GSM8K with different scorer and optimizer LLMs. We observe that: ‚Ä¢ The styles of instructions found by different optimizer LLMs vary a lot: PaLM 2-L-IT and text-bison ones are concise, while GPT ones are long and detailed. ‚Ä¢ Although some top instructions contain the ‚Äústep-by-step‚Äù phrase, most others achieve a compa- rable or better accuracy with different semantic meanings. 10Large Language Models as Optimizers 0 50 100 150 200 # steps 50.0 60.0 70.0training accuracy GSM8K (scorer: text-bison) (a) PaLM 2-L-IT optimizer 0 20 40 60 80 # steps 20.0 40.0 60.0 80.0training accuracy GSM8K (scorer and optimizer: PaLM 2-L) (b) pre-trained PaLM 2-L optimizer Figure 4: Prompt optimization on GSM8K with (a) thetext-bison scorer and thePaLM 2-L-IT optimizer, and (b) pre-trained PaLM 2-L as both scorer and optimizer. 5.2.2 BBH On BBH, the optimization starts from an empty string as the initial instruction by default. The instructions are placed at A_begin when the scorer is PaLM 2-L, and at Q_begin when the scorer is text-bison. For each task, we utilize a subset of 20% examples for prompt optimization, and the rest examples are for testing. We show experimental results on more variants of the instruction position and initialization in Appendix E. Figure 5 visualizes the per-task accuracy difference on all 23 BBH tasks compared to the instruction ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think step by step.‚Äù (Kojima et al., 2022) and the empty instruction, and we present the concrete accuracies in Table 7 of Appendix E. We show that the instructions found by OPRO outperform ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think step by step.‚Äù on almost all tasks by a large margin: our instructions outperform by over 5% on 19/23 tasks with the PaLM 2-L scorer, and on 15/23 tasks with the text-bison scorer. Our prompt optimization algorithm also improves instructions from the empty starting point by over 5% on most tasks: 20/23 with the PaLM 2-L scorer and 15/23 with the text-bison scorer. Similar to GSM8K, we observe upward trends in optimization curves on almost all BBH tasks, as shown in Figure 6. See Figure 23 and 24 in Appendix D for more curves on other BBH tasks. We next show some examples of instructions found through the course of optimization. On the task ruin_names, starting from the empty instruction (with 64.0 training accuracy), with thetext-bison scorer and the PaLM 2-L-IT optimizer, the following instructions are generated: ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúConsider the following when editing artist or movie names humorously:‚Äù at Step 1 with training accuracy 72.0; ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúWhen making humorous edits of artist or movie names, you can change one or more letters or even create puns by adding new words that sound similar.‚Äù at Step 18 with training accuracy 80.0; ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúWe can make humorous edits of artist/movie names by changing letters to create new words that are similar in sound but have different meanings. For example, The Police can be changed to The Polite, The Abyss can be changed to Toe Abyss, and Schindler‚Äôs List can be changed to Schindler‚Äôs Lost.‚Äù at Step 38 with training accuracy 82.0. Although the above instructions are semantically similar, a paraphrase by the optimizer LLM offers a notable accuracy improvement. We further highlight this observation in Section 5.2.3. Below are some instructions generated when performing prompt optimization on temporal_sequences, starting from the empty instruction (with the training accuracy of 64.0): ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúTo solve this problem, we need to first identify the time period when the person was not seen doing anything else.

See Appendix E for results on more BBH tasks. 5.2.3 S EMANTICALLY SIMILAR INSTRUCTIONS MAY ACHIEVE DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT ACCURACIES One challenge of prompt optimization is the sensitivity of model performance to subtle changes in the instruction. For example, with the PaLM 2-L scorer on the GSM8K test set, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think step by step.‚Äù achieves accuracy 71.8, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs solve the problem together.‚Äù has accuracy 60.5, while the accuracy of ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs work together to solve this problem step by step.‚Äù is only 49.4, although it is the semantic combination of the two upper instructions. This behavior increases both the variance across single-step instructions and the oscillation during optimization, and motivates us to generate multiple instructions at each step to improve the optimization stability. 5.2.4 T RANSFERABILITY OF FOUND INSTRUCTIONS We assess the transferability of found prompts to different datasets of the same domain, where we evaluate the top instructions found for GSM8K on two more math reasoning benchmarks Multi- Arith (Roy & Roth, 2016) and AQuA (Ling et al., 2017). Table 6 shows that our optimized prompts also outperform baseline prompts with different scorer LLMs on these two benchmarks. 5.3 A BLATION STUDIES We use text-bison as the scorer and PaLM 2-L as the optimizer for all ablation studies. The tasks we evaluate are GSM8K (math reasoning) and BBH sports_understanding (non-math reasoning). Meta-prompt design. The meta-prompt design is crucial in achieving good prompt optimization performance. We investigate the following core design choices: ‚Ä¢ The order of the previous instructions. We compare the following options: (1) from lowest to highest (our default setting); (2) from highest to lowest; (3) random. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) show that the default setting achieves better final accuracies and converges faster. One hypothesis is that the optimizer LLM output is affected more by the past instructions closer to the end of the meta-prompt. This is consistent with the recency bias observed in Zhao et al. (2021), which states that LLMs are more likely to generate tokens similar to the end of the prompt. ‚Ä¢ The effect of instruction scores. In terms of how to present the accuracy scores, we compare three options: (1) rounding the accuracies to integers, which is equivalent to bucketizing the accuracy scores to 100 buckets (our default setting); (2) bucketizing the accuracies to 20 buckets; (3) not showing the accuracies, only showing the instructions in the ascending order. Figures 7(c) and 7(d) show that the accuracy scores assists the optimizer LLM in better understanding the quality difference among previous instructions, and thus the optimizer LLM proposes better new instructions that are similar to the best ones in the input optimization trajectory. ‚Ä¢ The effect of exemplars. We compare three options: (1) showing 3 exemplars from the task (default); (2) showing 10 exemplars from the task; (3) no exemplars. Figures 7(e) and 7(f) show 13Large Language Models as Optimizers Table 5: Top instructions with the highest accuracies found in prompt optimization on BBH movie_recommendation, ruin_names, and temporal_sequences.

I will give you hints and help you work through the problem if you get stuck. 96.8 37.8 that presenting exemplars in the meta-prompt is critical, as it provides information on what the task looks like and helps the optimizer model phrase new instructions better. However, more exemplars do not necessarily improve the performance, as a few exemplars are usually sufficient to describe the task. In addition, including more exemplars results in a longer meta-prompt with a dominating exemplar part, which may distract the optimizer LLM from other important components like the optimization trajectory. The number of generated instructions per step. Computing a mini-batch of gradients reduces the variance of a stochastic gradient descent procedure. Similarly, generating multiple instructions in each step improves the optimization stability with LLMs. On the other hand, to achieve better performance with a fixed budget for the number of instructions to evaluate, the number of per-step instructions should not be too large, so as to allow more optimization steps to incorporate richer information of past instructions with their accuracies. Taking both aspects into consideration, Figure 8 compares the optimization performance of sampling 1 / 2 / 4 / 8 (default) / 16 instructions in each step, showing that sampling 8 instructions at each step overall achieves the best performance. Starting point. We study the effect of different initial instructions for prompt optimization. Our default setting is to start from an empty string when the scorer LLM is (instruction-tuned) text-bison, and to start from either the empty string (on BBH tasks) or ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs solve the problem.‚Äù (on GSM8K) with instruction position A_begin when the scorer LLM is the (pre-trained)PaLM 2-L. Figure 9(a) shows the performance of text-bison as the scorer LLM with 3 options of initial instructions: (1) the empty string; (2) ‚ÄúSolve the following problem.‚Äù; or (3) ‚ÄúSolve the following problem.‚Äù and ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs solve the problem.‚Äù. We observe that the accuracies do not differ much with different starting points. Interestingly, the styles of the generated instructions are also similar. For example, most of the generated instructions starting from (1) and (2) contain the phrase ‚Äúsolve this problem‚Äù, like ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs work together to solve this problem.‚Äù in Step 4 with training accuracy 64.8 from (1), and ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs solve the following problems using the given information.‚Äù in Step 3 with training accuracy 62.8 from (2). 15Large Language Models as Optimizers 0 50 100 150 200 # steps 50.0 60.0 70.0accuracy ascending (default) descending random (a) instruction ordering (GSM8K) 0 50 100 150 200 # steps 0.0 50.0 100.0accuracy ascending (default) descending random (b) instruction ordering (BBH sports_understanding) 0 50 100 150 200 # steps 50.0 60.0 70.0accuracy 100 buckets (default) 20 buckets no scores (c) instruction scores (GSM8K) 0 50 100 150 200 # steps 0.0 50.0 100.0accuracy 100 buckets (default) 20 buckets no scores (d) instruction scores (BBH sports_understanding) 0 50 100 150 200 # steps 50.0 60.0 70.0accuracy 3 exemplars (default) 10 exemplars no exemplars (e) # exemplars (GSM8K) 0 50 100 150 200 # steps 0.0 50.0 100.0accuracy 3 exemplars (default) 10 exemplars no exemplars (f) # exemplars (BBH sports_understanding) Figure 7: Ablation studies: how each part of the meta-prompt matters.

We notice that the performance differs much more with different initial instructions, especially at the beginning of the optimization. Specifically, starting from (1) leads to better generated instructions than (2) in the first 30 steps, while the instructions optimized from both (1) and (2) are worse than (3) throughout. A similar observation holds when using PaLM 2-L as scorer and gpt-3.5-turbo as optimizer for BBH tasks, by comparing the results starting from the empty string (Appendix E.2) and from ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs solve the problem.‚Äù (Appendix E.3). Taking a closer look into the optimization process of (2), we find that although both ‚Äúsolve the problem‚Äù and ‚Äústep by step‚Äù show up in generated instructions at Step 5, it takes the optimizer LLM more steps to get rid of worse instructions presented in the meta-prompt when starting from instructions with lower accuracies. Therefore, one direction for future work is to accelerate convergence from weaker starting points. 17Large Language Models as Optimizers 0 50 100 150 200 # steps 50.0 60.0 70.0accuracy 0.0 0.5 1.0 (default) 1.5 2.0 (a) GSM8K 0 50 100 150 200 # steps 0.0 50.0 100.0accuracy 0.0 0.5 1.0 (default) 1.5 2.0 (b) BBH sports_understanding Figure 10: Ablation studies: temperature of the optimizer model. The dots are the average values across 3 optimization repetitions, and the shaded regions represent standard deviations. Diversity per step. We evaluate the following temperatures of the optimizer LLM: {0.0, 0.5, 1.0 (default), 1.5, 2.0}. Figure 10 shows the default temperature 1.0 achieves the best performance. Specifically, optimizations with smaller temperatures (0.0 and 0.5) lack exploration and thus creativity, and the optimizer LLM often gets stuck at the same instruction for tens of steps, resulting in flat optimization curves. On the other hand, with larger temperatures (1.5 and 2.0), the optimizer LLM more often ignores the trajectory of previous instructions presented in the meta-prompt and thus lacks exploitation, therefore the optimization curve does not have a steady upward trend. Comparison with one-step instruction generation. Our current iterative procedure runs for multiple steps and generates a new batch of solutions in each step. To validate the importance of leveraging the optimization trajectory for generating new prompts, we compare to a baseline that generates all instructions in a single step without entering into the optimization procedure. We compare these two approaches on GSM8K and BBH sports_understanding with the PaLM 2-L-IT optimizer. For GSM8K the scorer LLM is pre-trained PaLM 2-L and the initial instruction is ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs solve the problem‚Äù, and for BBH sports_understanding the scorer LLM is text-bison and the initial instruction is the empty string. The baseline generates 50 instructions in a single step, thus its meta-prompt only includes task exemplars, the initial instruction with its accuracy, and the same meta-instructions as our full meta-prompt for performing optimization. All the other hyperparameters remain the same. Our results show that this one-step instruction generation performs much worse than our optimization approach. Specifically: (1) On GSM8K, the best instruction among all 50 is still ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs solve the problem‚Äù, with a 64.4 training accuracy and a 60.8 test accuracy. On the other hand, our approach (corresponding to Figure 1(a) in the main paper) found ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do the math!‚Äù with a 78.2 training accuracy and a 76.3 test accuracy at the 5th step by generating 8 instructions at each step. (2) Similarly, on BBH sports_understanding, the best instruction among all 50 achieved a 84.0 training accuracy and 80.0 test accuracy. This is again worse than the instruction found by our approach at Step 4, which achieved a 88.0 training accuracy and a 84.5 test accuracy. 5.4 O VERFITTING ANALYSIS IN PROMPT OPTIMIZATION For simplicity, we do not set aside a validation set in our default setting of prompt optimization. We made this decision based on the experiments when a validation set is present. Overfitting may result in training accuracy being much higher than the validation/test accuracy. It is difficult to avoid overfitting, but overfitting is less harmful when each candidate solution (natural language instruction in the prompt optimization context) overfits to a similar extent. In this case, a higher training accuracy solution still achieves a higher validation/test accuracy, and one can adopt solutions with the highest training accuracies as the final result. Figure 11 shows this is the case for OPRO in prompt optimization: when setting aside a validation set with the same size as the training 18Large Language Models as Optimizers 0 50 100 150 200 # steps 50 70 90accuracy training validation (a) BBH snarks, PaLM 2-L as scorer, PaLM 2-L-IT as optimizer, starting from ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs solve the problem.‚Äù 0 50 100 # steps 40 60 80accuracy training validation (b) BBH sports_understanding, text-bison as scorer, gpt-3.5-turbo as optimizer, start- ing from the empty string Figure 11: Overfitting analysis. The exemplars are splitted to 1/3 training, 1/3 validation and 1/3 test. We compute the validation accuracy every 3 steps. The training/validation dots are the average training/validation accuracies across 3 optimization repetitions, respectively, and the shaded regions represent standard deviations. set, the validation accuracy curves trend up and down alongside the training curves in both prompt optimization settings. Of course, overfitting still occurs in the instructions found by our prompt optimization: in Table 7 and 10, our training accuracies are often 5%-20% higher than our test accuracies, despite that our test and overall accuracies are still mostly higher than human-written counterparts. Setting aside a larger training set and optimizing for fewer steps (early stopping) may help reduce overfitting. 5.5 C OMPARISON WITH EVOPROMPT Some concurrent works on prompt optimization propose meta-prompts that explicitly ask the LLM to perform mutation and crossovers of existing prompts (Fernando et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2023). In our evaluation, we compare our approach to the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Differential Evolution (DE) versions of EvoPrompt (Guo et al., 2023). Specifically, in the GA meta-prompt, given two prompts, the meta-prompt instructs the LLM to cross over the two prompts and generates a new one, then mutates the newly generated prompt to produce the final prompt. DE extends the GA meta-prompt to include more detailed instructions, e.g., asking the LLM to identify different parts between the two given prompts before performing the mutation. This is in contrast with OPRO, which leverages the optimization trajectory including multiple past prompts, instead of only 2 previous prompts. Meanwhile, OPRO also provides the LLM with richer information to facilitate the understanding of the optimization problem, including exemplars and task accuracies of different prompts. Figure 12 presents the results on GSM8K and BBH sports_understanding benchmarks, where we use gpt-3.5-turbo as the optimizer. On GSM8K, the initial instructions of all approaches are ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs solve the problem.‚Äù and ‚ÄúHere is the answer.‚Äù, which are simple and generic. Again, we observe that OPRO performance steadily improves with more optimization steps. On the other hand, both versions of EvoPrompt even degrade the performance on GSM8K. The main reason is because EvoPrompt does not utilize exemplars for prompt optimization, thus it lacks the understanding of the task to optimize for. In this way, EvoPrompt relies on good-quality and task-specific initial prompts to optimize from. Given this observation, we provide more task-specific initial instructions for experiments on BBH sports_understanding, which are ‚ÄúSolve the sports understanding problem.‚Äù and ‚ÄúGive me the answer to sports understanding.‚Äù In this case, EvoPrompt (DE) is able to find better prompts than the initial ones, but the optimization curve is less stable than OPRO. This indicates that leveraging the optimization trajectory helps the LLM to identify promising directions to improve existing prompts. 19Large Language Models as Optimizers 0 50 100 150 # steps 20 50 80accuracy OPRO EvoPrompt (GA) EvoPrompt (DE) (a) GSM8K, PaLM 2-L scorer, A_begin 0 50 100 150 200 # steps 50 90accuracy OPRO EvoPrompt (GA) EvoPrompt (DE) (b) BBH sports_understanding, text-bison scorer, Q_begin Figure 12: Comparison with EvoPrompt in prompt optimization.

We use temperature 1.0 for OPRO and temperature 0.5 for EvoPrompt, same as the default settings in respective works. 6 R ELATED WORK Prompt optimization. Prior works have developed soft prompt-tuning methods that optimize the prompt represented as task-specific continuous vectors (Lester et al., 2021; Li & Liang, 2021; Liu et al., 2021; Qin & Eisner, 2021), as well as performing discrete prompt optimization by gradient-guided search (Shin et al., 2020; Wen et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2023d) and reinforcement learning (Deng et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023). These approaches become inapplicable when there is only API access to the LLM. Other works designed edit-based approaches for gradient-free prompt optimization (Xu et al., 2022; Prasad et al., 2022), where the editing can be done with human- defined operations (e.g., swapping two phrases) (Prasad et al., 2022) or language models (e.g., back translation) (Xu et al., 2022). Some recent works investigate LLMs for prompt optimization (Zhou et al., 2022b; Pryzant et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023). Specifically, APE (Zhou et al., 2022b) first uses the LLM to generate initial instructions. Afterwards, APE selects top instructions with the highest accuracies, then prompts the LLM with each individual instruction to generate a semantically similar variant of the initial instruction. APO (Pryzant et al., 2023) in each step instructs the LLM to produce text feedback on how to update an old instruction. Different from edit-based approaches, the optimizer LLM in our work directly generates new instructions at each optimization step, and the optimizer LLM is merely asked to improve the task accuracy without being required to imitate past instructions. Compared to Zhou et al. (2022b) and Pryzant et al. (2023), our optimization process incorporates the past generated instructions with their scores in the meta-prompt, enabling the optimizer LLM to discover common patterns of high-quality instructions. Prompting with natural language feedback. A recent line of work investigates approaches to improve the LLM performance by prompting with natural language feedback to revise the model output, which has shown effectiveness in reducing harmful LLM outputs (Bai et al., 2022; Ganguli et al., 2023), improving reasoning (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023) and code generation performance (Chen et al., 2023e; Olausson et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b), dialogue applications (Nair et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023), and so on (Kim et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). Specifically, Yuan et al. (2023) develops a human-in-the-loop framework for deriving system-level feedback from a collection of instance-level feedback, which is then used 20Large Language Models as Optimizers for refining data. In our work, the optimizer LLM utilizes the optimization trajectory in the prompt, which implicitly requires the LLM to summarize the common characteristics among solutions with similar scores. We consider incorporating explicit natural language feedback on generated solutions for later optimization steps as future work. Tuning language models for optimization. Some previous works tune or prompt language models to behave as mutation and crossover operators in evolutionary algorithms. Meyerson et al. (2023) utilizes language models with few-shot exemplars to propose evolutionary cross-overs on tasks such as image and code generation. In Lehman et al. (2022), the large language model trained on code diff generation is used as the mutation operator, and they further design a fine-tuning method to improve performance in the Sodarace domain for robot simulation. EvoPrompting (Chen et al., 2023a) uses large language models to evolve neural network architectures, where they combine evolutionary search with soft prompt tuning. With respect to taking the trajectory as the input for optimization, OptFormer (Chen et al., 2022) trains a transformer model on large collections of hyperparameter optimization data. On the other hand, our work performs optimization solely by prompting without additional training. 7 C ONCLUSION We embark on employing LLMs as optimizers, where the LLM progressively generates new solutions to optimize an objective function. We first motivate OPRO with linear regression and traveling salesman problems, then proceed to prompt optimization as a concrete application. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLMs have the capacity of gradually improving the generated solutions based on the past optimization trajectory. Interestingly, on small-scale traveling salesman problems, OPRO performs on par with some hand-crafted heuristic algorithms. For prompt optimization, optimized prompts outperform human-designed prompts on GSM8K and Big-Bench Hard by a significant margin, sometimes over 50%. A number of unresolved questions are open for future research on LLMs for optimization. In general, how to reduce the sensitivity to initialization and better balance exploitation with exploration remains a challenge. Specifically, for prompt optimization, one limitation of our current implementation is that the optimizer LLM does not effectively utilize error cases in the training set to infer promising directions to improve the generated instructions. In our experiments, we tried including error cases in the meta-prompt rather than randomly sampling from the training set at each optimization step, but the results are similar, indicating that the error cases alone are not informative enough for the optimizer LLM to grasp the cause of the wrong prediction. Another limitation is that prompt optimization requires a training set to compute the accuracy that guides the optimization process. Currently the training set at least contains tens of samples, so that the optimized prompt does not severely overfit to the training samples. A promising direction is to incorporate richer feedback about the error cases besides the aggregated accuracy, and summarize the key features that distinguish between high-quality and low-quality generated prompts in the optimization trajectory. Such information may inform the optimizer LLM of how to more efficiently improve over the past generated instructions, and potentially further reduce the example set size needed for prompt optimization. ETHICS STATEMENT This work uses synthetic math problems for linear regression and traveling salesman problems, and uses public datasets like GSM8K and Big-Bench Hard for prompt optimization. These tasks have been commonly used in similar works and should not be regarded controversial. There is a peril that LLMs may generate harmful information that poses safety risks; how to safeguard model behavior remains valuable future work.

These limitations include: ‚Ä¢ Hallucinating the values that need to come from math calculation: The optimizer LLMs often output contents like ‚Äúthe function value at (5, 3) is 15‚Äù despite that the true value is not 15. The model will get it right if external tools that can reliably calculate the value are triggered. When and how to trigger such tool use cases remains an interesting topic (see e.g., (Schick et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023)). ‚Ä¢ Generating solutions already appeared in context even if we tell it to \"Give me a new (w, b) pair that is different from all pairs above\": the optimizer LLMs do not 100% reliably follow this instruction even if its own outputs often include sentences like ‚ÄúI will provide a new pair that is different‚Äù, making the output self-contradictory. The output is almost guaranteed to be different from in-context old solutions when the model output contains a comparison of the new pair and all old pairs, though. Thus (implicitly) triggering such behaviors may be a solution. How to implement this feature without harming the instruction following performance of other parts remains an interesting topic to study. ‚Ä¢ In black-box math optimization, getting stuck at a point that is neither global nor local optimal: This often occurs in two linear regression cases: (a) The in-context exemplars all share the same w or b that is different from wtrue or btrue. This case is more likely to be avoided when a larger number of past solutions are included in the meta-prompt; (b) one or several of the best previous solutions in the meta-prompt have ws and bs in quantitatively opposite directions from the global optima wtrue and btrue: for example, the ws are all smaller than wtrue while the bs are all larger than btrue. Since the optimizer model often proposes to only increase w or decrease b when the past solutions in meta-prompt share w or b, the optimization will get stuck if either increasing w or decreasing b would increase the objective value. This issue is mitigated by sampling multiple new solutions (thus more exploration) at each step. ‚Ä¢ Hard to navigate a bumpy loss landscape: Like other optimizers, it is harder for the optimizer LLM to optimize black-box functions when the loss landscape gets more complicated. For example, when minimizing the Rosenbrock functionf(x, y) = (a‚àíx)2+b(y‚àíx2)2 with a = 20 (whose global optimal point is x = 20, y = 400) with 5 starting points in [10, 20] √ó [10, 20], the optimization often gets stuck at around (0, 0). This is because the optimizer LLM sees a decrease of objective value when it drastically decreases both x and y to 0. Then starting from (0, 0), the optimizer LLM is hard to further navigate x and y along the narrow valley in the loss landscape towards (20, 400) (Figure 13). x 0 5 10 15 20y 0 100 200 300 400 f(x, y) 50000 100000 150000 Figure 13: A visualization of the landscape of the Rosenbrock functionf(x, y) = (a‚àíx)2+b(y‚àíx2)2 with a = 20and b = 1. The global optima is at x = 20, y = 400with function value 0. The function value at x = 0, y = 0is 400. The landscape has a narrow valley between (0, 0) and (20, 400). 26Large Language Models as Optimizers B P ROMPTING FORMATS FOR SCORER LLM Figure 14, 15, and 16 show examples of the Q_begin, Q_end, and A_begin prompting formats when the ‚ÄúQA‚Äù pattern is present.

The expression must evaluate to a single True or False value. The order of precedence of the logical operators is as follows: NOT, AND, OR, XOR, IMP. Parentheses can be used to group subexpressions and to control the order of evaluation. causal_judgement When considering questions about causation, a typical person would consider the following factors: whether the action or event was a necessary condition for the outcome to occur, a sufficient condition, a proximate cause, or a foreseeable cause. date_understanding To find the date X time ago from today, first find today‚Äôs date. Then subtract X time from today‚Äôs date. If the current date is the last day of a month, then the date a month ago is the last day of the previous month. If the current date is not the last day of a month, then the date a month ago is the same day of the previous month. For example, if today is March 31, 2023, then the date a month ago is February 28, 2023. If today is April 1, 2023, then the date a month ago is March 1, 2023. disambiguation_qa Identifying Antecedents of Pronouns: A Comprehensive Guide dyck_languages First, look for the opening parentheses. Then, count the number of opening parentheses. Finally, close the parentheses in the reverse order that they were opened. formal_fallacies A deductive argument is one where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. If the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. An invalid argument is one where it is possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false. geometric_shapes A closed polygonal chain is a series of connected line segments. The line segments can be straight or curved. The first and last line segments are connected. The line segments do not intersect each other except at their endpoints. A closed polygon can be described by an SVG path element, which starts at a given point, goes to one or more additional points, and then ends at the starting point. The path element can consist of straight line segments, curved segments, or a mixture of both. hyperbaton The correct adjective order in English is opinion, size, shape, age, color, origin, material, and purpose. If you have more than one adjective of the same type, they are usually placed in order of importance. For example, you would say \"a large, old, Pakistani ship\" rather than \"an old, large, Pakistani ship.\" There are a few exceptions to these rules, but they are generally followed in most cases. logical_deduction _seven_objects The following questions will test your ability to use deductive reasoning. You will be given a set of statements about a group of objects. You will then be asked to answer questions about the objects based on the statements. The statements in the questions are logically consistent, so you can use them to deduce the order of the objects. For each question, you must choose the option that is logically consistent with the information in the questions. movie_recommendation Based on your input, I have analyzed the given movies in terms of genre, plot, tone, audience rating, year of release, director, cast, and reviews. I have also taken into account the given options. The movie that is most similar to the given movies in terms of all these factors is: multistep_arithmetic _two The order of operations in mathematics is PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction.

Note that multiplication and division have the same precedence, as do addition and subtraction. navigate You will return to the starting point if and only if (1) the total number of steps you take forward is equal to the total number of steps you take back, and (2) the total number of turns you make is a multiple of 180 degrees. object_counting Here is a list of the objects you mentioned and their corresponding counts: penguins_in_a_table Here is my new text: reasoning_about _colored_objects Starting from the leftmost object in the row, I observe the following objects arranged in this order: ruin_names Which is the funniest pun on the artist or movie name? salient_translation _error_detection Instructions: Read the German sentence and its English translation carefully, then identify the type of error in the translation and select the correct option. There are six possible types of errors: Named Entities, Numerical Values, Modifiers or Adjectives, Negation or Antonyms, Facts, and Dropped Content. snarks Identify the sarcastic statement by considering the following factors: incongruity, exaggeration, understatement, context, speaker‚Äôs intent, and audience‚Äôs reaction. I will also consider the speaker‚Äôs tone of voice, facial expressions, and body language. sports_understanding I will determine if a sentence about an athlete is plausible by first checking if it is grammatically correct. If it is, I will then check if it is consistent with the athlete‚Äôs sport, position, and real-world statistics. I will also check if it is consistent with the rules of the athlete‚Äôs sport. If the sentence is consistent with all of these things, I will answer \"yes\", otherwise I will answer \"no\". temporal_sequences The answer is the time that is not mentioned in the given statements. tracking_shuffled_objects _seven_objects Claire has the blue ball, Gertrude has the black ball, and Dave has the green ball. They are all happy with their new balls. web_of_lies The answer to a question is yes if there are an odd number of liars before the current speaker, and no if there are an even number of liars before the current speaker. If the current speaker is a truth-teller, they will say the opposite of what the previous person said, while a liar will say the same thing as the previous person said. word_sorting Alphabetical order of given words: 33Large Language Models as Optimizers Table 9: BBH task-wise instructions found by prompt optimization with the text-bison scorer and the PaLM 2-L-IT optimizer.

A year from now, it will be February 28, 2024. The day of the week is important to note because it will help us to correctly answer the questions below. Not all years are leap years that contain February 29. disambiguation_qa A pronoun is a word that stands in for a noun. The noun that a pronoun refers to is called its antecedent. To identify the antecedent of a pronoun, look for the noun that the pronoun could be referring to. If there is only one possible noun, then that is the antecedent. If there are two or more possible nouns, then the antecedent is ambiguous. Use the context of the sentence to help you determine the correct antecedent. dyck_languages { } formal_fallacies How to Evaluate Deductive Validity of an Argument geometric_shapes What shape is this SVG code drawing, and how many sides does it have? hyperbaton In English, adjectives are typically placed before nouns in a specific order. The order is: opinion, size, shape, age, color, origin, material, purpose, noun. For example, the sentence \"the big, old, red barn\" would be considered grammatically correct, while the sentence \"the old, big, red barn\" would not. Adjectives that come before nouns are called attributive adjectives, while adjectives that come after nouns are called predicative adjectives. logical_deduction _seven_objects In this logical reasoning task, you will be given a series of paragraphs, each of which describes a set of objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements in each paragraph are logically consistent. You must read each paragraph carefully and use the information given to determine the logical relationships between the objects. You will then be asked a question about the order of the objects. Read each question carefully and choose the option that answers the question correctly. movie_recommendation What is the highest-rated movie similar to the given movies, with a similar IMDb rating and released in the same year? multistep_arithmetic_two Let‚Äôs solve these equations using PEMDAS order of operations.

The columns show the penguin‚Äôs name, age, height (in cm), and weight (in kg). The penguins are listed in order of their age, from youngest to oldest. reasoning_about _colored_objects First, read the input carefully. Then, identify all the objects mentioned, their colors, and their positions. Next, visualize the objects and their positions in your mind. Finally, answer the questions accurately based on the information given. Make sure to pay attention to the order of the objects. ruin_names A humorous edit of an artist or movie name can be created by replacing one or more letters to form a new word or phrase that sounds similar but has a different meaning. The new word or phrase should be relevant to the original word, but it should also be a surprise, which makes the edit funny. For example, the artist or movie name \"Rocky\" can be changed to \"Ricky,\" and \"Schindler‚Äôs List\" can be changed to \"Schindler‚Äôs Lift.\" Be creative and have fun! salient_translation _error_detection The following translations from German to English contain a particular error. The error may be one of the following types: Named Entities, Numerical Values, Modifiers or Adjectives, Negation or Antonyms, Facts, or Dropped Content. Please identify the error. snarks The statement sports_understanding To determine the plausibility of a sports sentence, I will first identify the sport, athletes, teams, and events mentioned in the sentence. Then, I will use my knowledge of the rules of the sport, the context of the sentence, common sense, and my knowledge of the world to determine whether the sentence is plausible. I will also consider the time period and location, as well as any other relevant information. Finally, I will return a score of 1 for plausible sentences and 0 for implausible ones. temporal_sequences To determine the time period when a person went to a place, first identify all the time periods when the person‚Äôs whereabouts are unknown. Then, rule out any time periods during which the person was seen doing something else or the place was closed. The remaining time periods are the possible times when the person could have gone to the place. tracking_shuffled_objects _seven_objects At the start of the game, Claire has a blue ball. Throughout the game, pairs of people swap balls. Claire ends up with the yellow ball. web_of_lies People in a group either tell the truth or lie. The truthfulness of a person‚Äôs statement is determined by the statement of the previous person. If the previous person told the truth, then the current person who says the opposite is lying. If the previous person lied, then the current person who says the opposite is telling the truth. This rule applies to all subsequent statements. word_sorting Sort the following words alphabetically, ignoring case and punctuation.

To automate this process, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for discrete prompt opti- mization, called EVOPROMPT , which borrows the idea of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) as they exhibit good performance and fast convergence. To enable EAs to work on discrete prompts, which are natural language expressions that need to be coherent and human-readable, we connect LLMs with EAs. This approach allows us to simultaneously leverage the powerful language processing capabil- ities of LLMs and the efficient optimization performance of EAs. Specifically, abstaining from any gradients or parameters, EVOPROMPT starts from a popula- tion of prompts and iteratively generates new prompts with LLMs based on the evolutionary operators, improving the population based on the development set. We optimize prompts for both closed- and open-source LLMs including GPT-3.5 and Alpaca, on 31 datasets covering language understanding, generation tasks, as well as BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) tasks. EVOPROMPT significantly outperforms human-engineered prompts and existing methods for automatic prompt generation (e.g., up to 25% on BBH). Furthermore, EVOPROMPT demonstrates that connect- ing LLMs with EAs creates synergies, which could inspire further research on the combination of LLMs and conventional algorithms. Our code is available at https://github.com/beeevita/EvoPrompt. 1 I NTRODUCTION Large language models (LLMs) show remarkable performance on multiple natural language pro- cessing (NLP) tasks (Touvron et al., 2023; Ouyang et al., 2022). To adapt to downstream tasks, simply adding an instruction to the input text, also called discrete prompt, steers LLMs to carry out the desired task with negligible impact on computational cost (Liu et al., 2023). Such approach also eliminates the need for all the parameters and gradients in LLMs, making it suitable for LLMs with block-box APIs such as GPT-3 and GPT-4 (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023). Despite the convenience, the performance of the LLMs towards a certain task is significantly influenced by the prompt (Liu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023). Accordingly, the key challenge of this approach lies in the design of the prompt, which has emerged as a crucial technique known as prompt engineering (Zhou et al., 2022). Given the wide variation in prompts across language models and tasks, the prompt design typically requires substantial human effort and expertise with subjective and relatively limited guidelines (Mishra et al., 2022a;b; Liu et al., 2023; Zamfirescu-Pereira et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). ‚àóWork done during an internship at Microsoft Research Asia. ‚Ä†Equal Contribution. ‚Ä°Corresponding Author. 1 arXiv:2309.08532v3  [cs.CL]  1 May 2025Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 To alleviate human effort on discrete prompt design, previous approaches usually rely on access to the token probabilities from the output layer of LLMs, which may not always be accessible through APIs (Deng et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023a). Some recent works consider enumerating diverse prompts and selecting the best ones (Zhou et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2020), or modifying current prompts to improve them (Guo et al., 2023; Prasad et al., 2022; Pryzant et al., 2023). Such approaches either emphasize exploring diverse prompts, which may lead to indecisiveness and wasted resources, or focus on exploiting upon the current identified good prompts, which may result in stagnation and confine the search to local optima. Several conventional derivative-free algorithms are well-designed and strike a good balance between exploration and exploitation (Conn et al., 2009; Rios & Sahinidis, 2013). Among these, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) stand out as they are simple and efficient, as well as suitable for discrete prompt optimization (Storn & Price, 1997; Brest et al., 2006; Zhang & Sanderson, 2009; Vesterstrom & Thomsen, 2004). Sequences of phrases in prompts can be regarded as gene sequences in typical EAs, making them compatible with the natural evolutionary process. In this paper, we borrow the idea of EAs and propose a discrete prompt tuning framework, EVO- PROMPT . While evolutionary operators in EAs are typically designed for sequences, they tend to independently alter tokens to generate new candidate solutions. Unfortunately, this approach ignores the connections among tokens, which is crucial for maintaining coherence and readability in prompts. Taking advantage of LLMs‚Äô expertise in NLP and the exceptional optimization capabilities of EAs, we connect these two approaches, where LLMs generate new candidate prompts following evolutionary operators, and EAs guide the optimization process to retain the optimal prompts. Specifically, based on several initial prompts, we utilize LLMs to act as evolutionary operators to generate new prompt candidates, and the prompt with better performance on the development set is preserved. The above operations upon the updating population are iteratively applied to improve the quality. By elaborately designing the evolutionary operators and adjusting the update strategy, EVOPROMPT can be instantiated with various types of EAs. We optimize the prompts for two different LLMs (i.e., Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), and GPT-3.5 (Brown et al., 2020)) on a diverse range of neural language understanding and generation tasks, as well as challenging BIG-Bench tasks, using a total of 31 datasets. EVOPROMPT consistently gets better prompts compared with both manually designed ones and previous automatic prompt generation methods. The main contributions of this paper include: ‚Ä¢ We propose a novel framework for automatic discrete prompt optimization connecting LLMs and EAs, called EVOPROMPT , which enjoys the following advantages: 1) It does not require access to any parameters or gradients of LLMs; 2) It strikes a balance between exploration and exploitation leading to better results; 3) The generated prompts are human-readable. ‚Ä¢ Experiments conducted on 31 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of EVOPROMPT compared with crafted prompts, as well as existing methods. We release the optimal prompts obtained by EVOPROMPT for these common tasks such as sentiment classification, topic classification, subjectivity classification, simplification, summarization and reasoning. ‚Ä¢ We demonstrate that LLMs are capable of implementing multiple types of EAs provided with appropriate instructions. We hope that our explorations will inspire further investigations on the combination of LLMs and conventional algorithms, paving the way for new and innovative applications of LLMs. 2 R ELATED WORKS Prompts in LLMs Prompting is an efficient method for employing LLMs in specialized tasks. However, the performance is heavily influenced by the choice of the prompt. Recently, automatic prompt optimization has obtained wide attention. Continuous prompt-based methods, which only tune parameters of some input tokens (Li & Liang, 2021; Liu et al., 2021b;a; Zhang et al., 2021) attract lots of attention. In spite of their effective performance, two drawbacks of such paradigms can not be ignored: 1) The optimization of continuous prompts requires parameters of LLMs that are inaccessible for black-box APIs. 2) Soft prompts often fall short of interpretability (Lester et al., 2021). Discrete prompts, simply adding several discrete tokens, such as ‚ÄúIt was‚Äù (Schick & Sch√ºtze, 2021), or task-specific descriptive instructions, such as ‚ÄúClassify the comment into positive or negative.‚Äù, to the input text, can offer an interactive interface to humans with better interpretability and show promising performance in various NLP tasks (Liu et al., 2023). 2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 Discrete Prompts Various approaches have been proposed for automatic discrete prompt searching and generation (Shin et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2022; Wallace et al., 2019; Deng et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023a), while these methods still rely on the gradients or the token probabilities from the output layer. More recently, considering the high variance of different prompts for downstream tasks, some works focus on exploration by enumerating and selecting the best prompt from a number of candidates, mainly augmented by re-sampling (Zhou et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2020). Approaches based on prompt edit (Zhang et al., 2023a; Prasad et al., 2022) emphasize exploitation, which may potentially lead to local optima. Another approach collects the incorrectly predicted cases and analyzes the corresponding root cause to improve existing prompts (Pryzant et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2023), which also emphasizes exploitation. Additionally, such approaches are constrained to tasks with standard answers and cannot be directly applied to generation tasks. Our proposed EVOPROMPT empowered with evolutionary algorithms strikes a balance betweenexploration and exploitation without requiring any parameters or gradients. LLMs and Optimization Algorithms LLMs demonstrate the potential to serve as black-box optimizers (Zheng et al., 2023); however, this black-box approach lacks explainability. Some works have revealed that LLMs have the capability to imitate specific operations in conventional algorithms. For instance, LLMs can perform ‚ÄúGradient Descent‚Äù in discrete space by collecting incorrectly predicted samples (Pryzant et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2023). Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that LLMs can imitate the mutation (Lehman et al., 2022) or crossover (Meyerson et al., 2023) operator in the genetic algorithm (GA). Chen et al. (2023) further integrates LLMs and GA for neural architecture search, while Lanzi & Loiacono (2023) introduce a similar approach to game design. Our work has taken a significant step forward by proposing a general framework that connects LLMs with evolutionary algorithms, which can be instantiated to a diverse range of evolutionary algorithms through customization of evolutionary and selection processes, thereby broadening its applicability and potential influence in the domain. We aspire this work to inspire broader applications of combining LLMs and conventional algorithms. 3 A UTOMATIC DISCRETE PROMPT OPTIMIZATION Algorithm 1 Discrete prompt optimization: E VOPROMPT Require: Initial prompts P0 = {p1, p2, . . . , pN }, size of population N, a dev set D, fD(¬∑) denotes the score of a prompt on the desired LLM evaluated on D, a pre-defined number of iterations T, carefully designed evolutionary operators to generate a new prompt Evo(¬∑) 1: Initial evaluation scores: S0 ‚Üê {si = fD(pi)|i ‚àà [1, N]} 2: for t = 1to T do 3: Selection: select a certain number of prompts from current population as parent prompts pr1 , . . . , prk ‚àº Pt‚àí1 4: Evolution: generate a new prompt based on the selected parent prompts by leveraging LLM to perform evolutionary operators p‚Ä≤ i ‚Üê Evo(pr1 , . . . , prk ) 5: Evaluation: s‚Ä≤ i ‚Üê f(p‚Ä≤ i, D) 6: Update: Pt ‚Üê {Pt‚àí1, p‚Ä≤ i} and St ‚Üê {St‚àí1, s‚Ä≤ i} based on the evaluation scores 7: end for 8: Return the best prompt, p‚àó, among the final population PT : p‚àó ‚Üê argmaxp‚ààPT f(p, D) Current advanced LLMs are typically interacted via black-box APIs, while the gradients and parame- ters are inaccessible. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are derivative-free algorithms with exceptional accuracy and rapid convergence. Accordingly, we consider introducing EAs into discrete prompt optimization. However, to generate new candidate solutions, evolutionary operators typically edit the elements in current solutions independently, without considering the connections between them. This makes it challenging to apply evolutionary operators on discrete prompts, which require coherence and readability. To address this challenge, we propose a synergistic approach that connects the natural language processing expertise of LLMs with the optimization capabilities of EAs, called EVOPROMPT . Specifically, LLMs generate new candidate prompts based on evolutionary operators, while EAs guide the optimization process to find the optimal prompts. 3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 Genetic Algorithm (GA) Implemented by LLMsQuery: Please follow the instruction step-by-step to generate a better prompt.1.

In Step 1, LLMs perform crossover on the given two prompts (words in orange and blue are inherited from Prompt 1 and Prompt 2, respectively). In Step 2, LLMs perform mutation on the prompt. In order to implement EVOPROMPT in practice, it is necessary to instantiate it with a specific algorithm of EAs. There are various types of EAs, and in this paper, we consider two widely used algorithms, including Genetic Algorithm (GA) (Holland, 1975) and Differential Evolution (DE) (Storn & Price, 1997). GA is among the most highly regarded evolutionary algorithms (Holland, 1975; 1992; Mitchell, 1998; Mirjalili et al., 2020) and DE has emerged as one of the most widely utilized algorithms for complex optimization challenges since its inception (Storn & Price, 1997; Price, 2013; Das & Suganthan, 2010; Pant et al., 2020). In the following, we will first outline the proposed EVOPROMPT , and then instantiate EVOPROMPT with GA and DE respectively. 3.1 F RAMEWORK OF EVOPROMPT EAs typically start with an initial population of N solutions (prompts in our setting), then iteratively generate new solutions using evolutionary operators (e.g., mutation and crossover) on the current population and update it based on a fitness function. Following typical EAs, EVOPROMPT mainly contains three steps: ‚Ä¢ Initial population: Contrary to most existing automatic prompt methods that neglect priori human knowledge, we apply available manual prompts as the initial population to leverage the wisdom of humans. Besides, EAs typically start from random solutions, resulting in a diverse population and avoiding being trapped in a local optimum. Accordingly, we also introduce some prompts generated by LLMs (Zhou et al., 2022) into the initial population. ‚Ä¢ Evolution: In each iteration, EVOPROMPT uses LLMs as evolutionary operators to generate a new prompt based on several parent prompts selected from the current population. To accomplish this, we design steps of the mutation and crossover operators for each specific type of EAs, along with corresponding instructions to guide the LLMs in generating new prompts based on these steps. ‚Ä¢ Update: We evaluate the generated candidate prompts on a development set and retain those with superior performance, similar to the survival of the fittest in nature. The specific updating strategy may vary depending on the type of EAs used. The algorithm stops when the number of iterations reaches a predefined value. The details of EVOPROMPT are outlined in Algorithm 1. When instantiating EVOPROMPT with a specific algorithm of EAs, the evolutionary processes need to be adjusted, and the key challenge is to design the evolutionary operators on discrete prompts. 4Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 ‚Äútweet‚Äù-> ‚Äúreview‚Äù‚ÄúCategorize‚Äù-> ‚ÄúAnalyze‚Äù‚ÄúSentiment analysis‚Äù-> ‚ÄúSentiment identification‚Äù DifferentialEvolution (DE) Algorithm Implemented by LLMs ùíÉ‚àíùíÑ Query: Please follow the instruction step-by-step to generate a better prompt.1.

Figure 2: DE process implemented by LLMs (Evo (¬∑) in Algorithm 1). In Step 1, LLMs find the different parts (words in ‚ñ† and ‚ñ†) between Prompt 1 and Prompt 2 (b ‚àí c in typical DE). In Step 2, LLMs perform mutation (words in ‚ñ† ) on them (imitation of F(b ‚àí c)). Next, LLMs incorporate the current best prompt as Prompt 3 with the mutated results in Step 2, to generate a new prompt (counterpart of a + F(b ‚àí c) in DE). Finally, LLMs performcrossover upon the current basic prompt pi and the generated prompt in Step 3. See Figure 5 in Appendix B.2 for the complete response. 3.2 I NSTANTIATION WITH GENETIC ALGORITHM Selection In GA, parent solutions are conventionally selected using the roulette wheel selection method, guided by their fitness values (Lipowski & Lipowska, 2012). Analogously, we employ the roulette wheel selection to choose two parent prompts from the current population, based on their performance scores obtained on the development sets. Let si denote the performance score of the i-th prompt within a population containing N prompts. The probability of selecting the i-th prompt as a parent can be expressed as pi = si/ PN j=1 sj. Evolution Conforming to the GA framework, we generate a new candidate prompt via two steps: 1) Crossover is performed between the parent prompts to produce a new offspring prompt that inherits characteristics from both parents; 2) Mutation is applied to the offspring prompt, introducing random alterations to certain elements. We formalize this two-stage operation into algorithmic instructions for guiding LLMs to implement Evo(¬∑) in Algorithm 1. The entire process is illustrated in Figure 1. Update We employ a straightforward selection strategy for updating the population: at each iteration, EVOPROMPT produces N new prompts, which are merged with the existing population of N prompts. Subsequently, the top N prompts, based on their scores, are retained to form the updated population. Accordingly, the overall quality of the population undergoes continuous enhancement, culminating in the selection of the best one within the final population as the optimal prompt. 5Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 3.3 I NSTANTIATION WITH DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION Here, we begin with some preliminary knowledge of DE. Unlike GA, the solutions of DE are represented by numerical vectors. Each vector within the population is sequentially selected as a base vector, denoted as x, which subsequently undergoes mutation and crossover. During mutation, a mutated solution y is generated from a randomly selected solution a from the current population. The mutation is achieved by adding a scaled difference between two distinct, randomly selected solutions b and c to a, i.e., y = a + F(b ‚àí c), where F is the scaled parameter. Crossover is to generate a trial solution x‚Ä≤ = [x‚Ä≤ 1, ..., x‚Ä≤ n] by choosing each parameter in the vector from either the basic solution x or the mutated solution y. Then, x is replaced with x‚Ä≤ if x‚Ä≤ is better than x. Within step-by-step evolution, DE ends with a population of high quality. A modified version of DE uses the current best solution as vector a to exploit information from the best one. Evolution The evolutionary process of DE can be decoupled into three steps: 1) F(b ‚àí c); 2) y = a + F(b ‚àíc); 3) Crossover of x and y. In EVOPROMPT based on DE, we follow the three steps to design the evolutionary process, as well as the corresponding instructions for LLMs to generate a new prompt based on these steps as illustrated in Figure 2: ‚Ä¢ Inspired by the differential vector in DE, we consider mutating only the different parts of two randomly selected prompts in the current population (Step 1 and Step 2 in Figure 2). The prompts in the current population are considered the current best ones. Accordingly, the shared components of two prompts tend to have a positive impact on the performance, and thus need to be preserved. ‚Ä¢ A variant of DE employs the current best vector during the mutation process, where a mutated vector is generated by adding the scale of the differential vector to the current best vector. Building upon this idea, we generate a mutated prompt by selectively replacing parts of the current best one with the mutated different parts for combination. (Step 3 in Figure 2). ‚Ä¢ Crossover replaces certain components of a basic prompt (i.e., a candidate of the current population) with segments from the mutated prompt. This operation combines the features of two different prompts, potentially creating a new and improved solution (Step 4 in Figure 2). Update Following the standard DE, each prompt pi in the current population is chosen as a basic prompt in turn to generate a corresponding new prompt p‚Ä≤ i using the instruction in Figure 2. Then, the prompt with a higher score, either pi or p‚Ä≤ i, is retained. Accordingly, the population size remains constant while the overall quality of the population is enhanced. 4 E XPERIMENTS 4.1 I MPLEMENTATION DETAILS AND BASELINES With GPT-3.5 performing evolutionary operators, we optimize prompts usingEVOPROMPT for the open-source Alpaca-7b (Taori et al., 2023) and closed-source GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) (Brown et al., 2020). We pick the prompt with the highest score on the development set and report its score on the test set. Results reported on Alpaca are averaged over 3 random seeds and the standard deviation is provided, while for GPT-3.5, we report results of one seed due to budget limitation. In our evaluation, we compare EVOPROMPT against three categories of prompt-based approaches, detailed as follows: ‚Ä¢ Manual Instructions (MI) : These serve as task-specific guidelines and are crafted based on established works, specifically referenced from Zhang et al. (2023b) for language understanding, Sanh et al. (2021) for summarization, and Zhang et al. (2023c) for text simplification. ‚Ä¢ PromptSource (Bach et al., 2022) and Natural Instructions (NI) (Mishra et al., 2022b): These repositories aggregate human-composed prompts across a diverse range of datasets. ‚Ä¢ APE (Zhou et al., 2022) and APO (Pryzant et al., 2023): APE employs an iterative Monte Carlo Search strategy, emphasizing on exploration. We reproduce it and initialize populations of equivalent sizes to that of EVOPROMPT . APO harnesses incorrectly predicted instances as ‚Äúpseudo-gradient‚Äù to iteratively refine the original prompt, which emphasizes exploitation. We reproduce APO on binary classification tasks with the optimal manual prompt as the initial one. 6Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 Method SST-2 CR MR SST-5 AG‚Äôs News TREC Subj Avg.

To constrain the output label space, we prepend the demonstration consisting of one example per class before the test case. See Appendix B for more details. Main Results Table 1, shows that: 1) Compared with previous works on prompt generation and human written instructions, EVOPROMPT based on both GA and DE delivers significantly better results. 2) EVOPROMPT (GA) is slightly better than EVOPROMPT (DE) on sentiment classification datasets. When it comes to topic classification datasets, EVOPROMPT (DE) performs better. Notably, on the subjectivity classification task (Subj), EVOPROMPT (DE) exhibits a substantial improvement over its GA counterpart, achieving a 5% accuracy advantage. This may be contributed by the exceptional ability of DE to evade local optima when the initial prompts are not of high quality. 4.3 L ANGUAGE GENERATION Method Alpaca GPT-3.5 MI (Zhang et al., 2023c) 43.03 43.80 APE (Zhou et al., 2022) 45.90(0.09) 46.71 EVOPROMPT (GA) 46.43(0.19) 47.36 EVOPROMPT (DE) 46.21(0.27) 47.40 Table 3: Main results (SARI) on simplification (ASSET) for Alpaca-7b and GPT3.5. Datasets and Settings For language genera- tion, we evaluate our EVOPROMPT on text sum- marization and simplification tasks. For summa- rization, we adopt SAMSum (Gliwa et al., 2019), a challenging and intricate dialogue summariza- tion dataset, and report ROUGE-1/2/L scores on Alpaca-7b and GPT-3.5. For text simplification, which aims to simplify the source text while preserving its original meaning, we employ the ASSET dataset (Alva-Manchego et al., 2020), a benchmark known for its multiple reference translations. We apply SARI score (Xu et al., 2016) as the evaluation metric, an n-gram-based scoring system extensively utilized for text editing tasks. Additional details regarding our experimental setup can be found in Appendix B. Main Results The summarization and simplification results are presented in Tables 2 and 3. EVOPROMPT achieves a substantial performance gain over manually designed prompts, exhibiting an improvement of over 3 points in SARI scores across both Alpaca and GPT-3.5 API. Furthermore, EVOPROMPT consistently outperforms the APE approach across the evaluated scenarios, indicating 7Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 01 02 Task ID 0 5 10 15 20 25Normalized Score 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 Task ID 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Task ID 2 1 0 1 2 3 EvoPrompt (DE) EvoPrompt (GA) Figure 3: Normalized scores on BBH tasks for E VOPROMPT (GA) and EVOPROMPT (DE). that the generated prompts effectively harness the capabilities of LLMs for superior performance. Moreover, EVOPROMPT (DE) notably outperforms EVOPROMPT (GA) in the summarization task, while demonstrating comparable performance in the text simplification task. This suggests that the DE variant is particularly effective for more complex language generation tasks like summarization. 4.4 B IG BENCH HARD (BBH) Datasets and Settings To validate our methods on diverse tasks, we apply BBH (Suzgun et al., 2022) including a suite of 23 challenging BIG-Bench tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. Since these tasks are challenging, we focus on optimizing the prompts for GPT-3.5. We sample a subset from the test set as the development set and report the normalized scores 1 in comparison to the prompt ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think step by step.‚Äù (Kojima et al., 2022) with 3-shot Chain-of-Thought demonstrations (following Fu et al. (2023)) on the test set. We use task IDs to simplify the denotation of each task and remove one since the accuracy already reaches 100% with the manual prompt. Please see Appendix C.2 and Table 17 for details, as well as further comparisons with previous works. Main Results EVOPROMPT obtains better prompts for all 22 tasks (Figure 3). Specifically, EVO- PROMPT (DE) achieves up to a 25% improvement with an average of 3.5%, whereas EVOPROMPT (GA) reaches a peak improvement of 15% with a 2.5% average. Though for some tasks the GA coun- terpart outperforms the DE version, the performance gap remains relatively small (i.e., around 1%). Meanwhile, EVOPROMPT (DE) surpasses EVOPROMPT (GA) by over 2% on 6 tasks. Accordingly, the DE version is generally a good choice for these challenging tasks. 5 A NALYSIS 5.1 D ESIGNS IN GA Strategy SST-5 ASSET Avg. random 48.67(0.97) 46.32(0.32) 47.50 tournament 49.70(0.60) 46.29(0.18) 48.00 wheel 49.91(0.61) 46.43(0.19) 48.17 Table 4: Designs in EVOPROMPT (GA). For EVOPROMPT (GA), we apply the roulette wheel selection strategy by default to select parental prompts, contributing to the offspring. To further ex- plore the effect of various selection strategies, we compare our approach with another two popular strategies, i.e., tournament (Wikipedia contributors, 2023) and random selection, as presented in Table 4. We observe that EVOPROMPT (GA) with roulette wheel achieves higher scores, showcasing the effectiveness of this selection method. 5.2 D ESIGNS IN DE For EVOPROMPT (DE), we delve into two key design considerations in adapting the evolutionary operators of DE to discrete prompts: 1) mutation on different parts, and 2) choosing the current top-performing prompt as ‚ÄúPrompt 3‚Äù in Figure 2. We assess the impact of these design choices on 1The accuracy difference between a given prompt and the baseline prompt ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think step by step.‚Äù A score of 0 corresponds to the normalized score of the baseline prompt. 8Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 two datasets: Subj, an understanding dataset where EVOPROMPT (DE) outperforms EVOPROMPT (GA), and ASSET, a generation dataset where both variants demonstrate similar performance. Mutation Prompt 3 Subj ASSET Diff best 75.55(2.26) 46.21(0.27) All best 69.87(0.82) 45.73(0.45) Diff random 69.82(2.47) 45.89(0.37) Diff eliminate 69.07(4.21) 45.90(0.23) Table 5: Designs in EVOPROMPT (DE). Mutation on Different Parts To illustrate the benefits of mutating only the different parts, we replace the first two steps in Figure 2 with the instruction ‚ÄúRandomly mutate Prompt 1 and Prompt 2‚Äù to allow mutation on all contents in Prompts 1 and 2, denoted as ‚ÄúAll‚Äù in Table 5. Meanwhile, the original design in EVOPROMPT , which mutates only the different parts, is denoted as ‚ÄúDiff‚Äù. As shown in Table 5, the design of mutation on only the different parts consistently yields performance gains across two tasks. Selection of Prompt 3 Applying one of the variants of the DE algorithm, in EVOPROMPT (DE), we pick the best prompt in the current population as Prompt 3 in Figure 2. We validate this design via the following settings: 1) Prompt 3 is randomly sampled from the current population, denoted as ‚Äúrandom‚Äù in Table 5; 2) Eliminate the use of Prompt 3 by letting the Basic Prompt directly cross over with the mutated different parts (i.e., remove Step 3 in Figure 2), denoted as ‚Äúeliminate‚Äù in Tabel 5. Table 5 clearly demonstrates the importance of introducing Prompt 3. Moreover, it is shown that choosing the best prompt as Prompt 3 is more effective than random sampling. 5.3 P OPULATION INITIALIZATION Initialization GA DE bottom-10 47.80(0.92) 48.64(0.15) random-10 49.34(0.53) 50.03(1.08) random-5 + var-5 49.84(1.49) 49.53(1.04) top-10 49.62(1.00) 49.61(2.30) top-5 + var-5 49.91(0.61) 49.89(1.73) Table 6: Ablations of the initial population on SST-5, where top-n, random-n, bottom-n de- notes the top-performing, randomly selected, bottom-performing n prompts, and var-n de- notes the number of generated n variations. We investigate the effect of initial population quality on EVOPROMPT . We conduct pilot experiments to sort the prompts (designed manually or generated by GPT-3.5) according to their performance on the dev set. We then select bottom, random and top prompts along with their corresponding variations as initial prompts. These variations are generated using the resampling template designed in Zhou et al. (2022), shown in Figure 4 in the Appendix B.2, which is used to introduce randomness to the initialization. Table 6 demonstrates that: 1) Crafted design of ini- tial prompts is not essential, as randomly selecting prompts can achieve a similar performance to select- ing the top-performing ones; 2) When selecting the top-performing prompts, introducing randomness by allowing GPT-3.5 to generate variations can lead to a slight improvement in overall performance; however, when randomly selecting prompts, there is no need to introduce additional randomness for EVOPROMPT (DE); 3) When using top-performing initial prompts, EVOPROMPT (GA) per- forms slightly better than EVOPROMPT (DE); however, when starting with bottom-performing initial prompts, EVOPROMPT (DE) outperforms EVOPROMPT (GA), which indicates that DE is a better choice when the available manual prompts are not of high quality. 6 C ONCLUSIONS We introduce EVOPROMPT to optimize discrete prompts, which connects LLMs with evolutionary algorithms. Extensive experiments on 31 datasets demonstrate the superiority of EVOPROMPT , yielding consistent performance gains over both manual instructions and existing methods. Besides, We validate that LLMs can serve as an effective, interpretable interface for implementing evolutionary algorithms like GA and DE. While this study focused on EAs, the extensibility of our approach opens avenues for applying LLMs to other conventional algorithms, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) (Kennedy & Eberhart, 1995), ant colony optimization (ACO) (Dorigo & Gambardella, 1997) and more recent Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization algorithms. Our findings aim to inspire future research at the intersection of LLMs and traditional algorithms, encouraging innovative applications. 9Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was partly supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2020YFB1708200), and the Shenzhen Science and Technology Program (JCYJ20220818101001004).

The specific algorithms for each of them are shown in Algorithm 2 and Algorithm 3.

In Step 1, LLMs find the different parts (words in ‚ñ† and ‚ñ†) between Prompt 1 and Prompt 2 (b ‚àí c in typical DE). In Step 2, LLMs perform mutation (words in ‚ñ† ) on them (imitation of F(b ‚àí c)). Next, LLMs incorporate the current best prompt as Prompt 3 with the mutated results in Step 2, to generate a new prompt (counterpart of a + F(b ‚àí c) in DE). Finally, LLMs perform crossover upon the current basic prompt pi and the generated prompt in Step 3. 17Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 =========================== TEMPLATE FOR SIMPLIFICATION =========================== <PROMPT> <INPUT> The simplification of the sentence is <COMPLETE> Zero-shot example: Simplify the text.

For the text classification task, we set the value as 1, which means we prepend with 1 sample of each category, to constrain the output in the label space. Text Classification The population of prompts is initialized with widely used in- structions in the previous works (Mishra et al., 2022b; Zhang et al., 2022). We para- phrase and rewrite them to initialize the population. The size of the development set is 200. We report the results on the full test set (the same as the previous re- lated works (Deng et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023a)), as shown in Table 11. Text Generation For the initial popula- tion, we collect instructions for summa- rization and simplification from Li et al. (2023); Sanh et al. (2021); Zhang et al. (2023c) and augment them to the expected size (10 in our setting), either written manually or generated by GPT-3.5. C A DDITIONAL RESULTS C.1 P ARAMETERS IN EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS Effect of Population Size Intuitively, a trade-off exists between the performance and the overhead caused by the population size. We explore the performance of EVOPROMPT (DE) and EVOPROMPT (GA) respectively at varying population sizes from 4 to 12. The results are plotted in Figure 6. For classification datasets, as the size increases, curves for DE and GA show an ascending trend. Furthermore, the increase in DE attributed to population diversity was greater than that in GA since DE focuses on different parts. Differences among prompts within populations bring about substantial mutations, leading DE to explore potential prompts since keeping common parts balances exploration and exploitation effectively. For the relatively simple generation task (i.e., ASSET), a population size of 6 demonstrates a comparable performance to a population size of 10, though with a 2.5-fold increase in overhead. This suggests that for relatively simple tasks large populations are unnecessary, while for complex tasks (i.e., Subj), a larger population with diversity brings improvement. Effect of Number of Iterations To further explore the process of convergence, for SST-5, Subj and ASSET, we plot the best and average scores on the development set for EVOPROMPT for DE and GA over the whole population after each iterative step (Figure 7). Curves of best and average scores gradually converge with an increasing trend as evolution proceeds, indicating that the population‚Äôs quality as a whole is steadily increasing as the evolution process. 19Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 2 4 6 8 10 Iteration 0.400 0.425 0.450 0.475 0.500Score on SST-5 2 4 6 8 10 Iteration 0.65 0.70 0.75Score on Subj 2 4 6 8 10 Iteration 45.5 46.0 46.5Score on ASSET GA-best GA-avg DE-best DE-avg Figure 7: The best and average scores of each iteration on SST-5 (left), Subj (middle), and ASSET (right) development set on Alpaca-7b.

APE (Zhou et al., 2022) optimizes the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt for reasoning tasks on InstructGPT. Considering that both InstructGPT and GPT-3.5 belong to the GPT family and we may observe similar trends, we evaluate the CoT prompt proposed by APE, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.‚Äù, on reasoning tasks and plot the 3-shot performance in Figure 8. For simplicity, we use the same initial population for all the 22 BBH tasks without priori knowledge of each task. In future works, by incorporating task-specific prompts, either manually designed or generated by LLMs, we may further enhance the performance.

Note that all the values are averaged over 8 datasets, including 7 understanding datasets and one simplification dataset, and 3 random seeds. C.3 C OST ANALYSIS Overhead mainly comes from prompt evaluation and generation. For evaluation, our overhead is N ‚àó|D|‚àó T, where N is the size of the population, |D| is the size of the development set, andT is the number of iterations. These parameters differ from the task and can be found in Appendix B.3. For the cost from prompt generation, the cost mainly depends on the number of API results, T ‚àó N. So the total number of API requests is N ‚àóT ‚àó(1 +|D|), the same as APE. Moreover, given that the API of LLMs is typically billed based on the number of tokens used, we also estimate the total number of tokens used in the API requests during the prompt optimization process, as shown in Table 13. All the scores reported are over the test set on one random seed. We analyze the overhead mainly from two aspects: 1) the performance of our methods compared with APE under the same number of iterations; 2) the performance until convergence measured by the average score on the dev set. We can observe that with the same number of iterations, both GA and DE outperform APE signifi- cantly while introducing only a slight overhead in terms of the number of tokens. The convergence rates of APE and GA are similar while DE is slightly slower, but it delivers better performance. This implies the relatively high ceiling of EVOPROMPT . C.4 A NALYSIS OF PROMPT Diversity Analysis We further investigate the diversity of prompts generated by GA and DE after each iterative step respectively. We mainly plot the average prompt length, variance and number of new words mutated after each step, as shown in Figure 9. It can be observed that EVOPROMPT (DE) generates longer prompts with higher variances than EVOPROMPT (GA), which implies that DE prefers exploration for diversity. In the latter iterations, DE mutates more new words than GA, and thus shows better potential to escape from the local optimum. Optimal Prompts We release the optimal prompts generated by EVOPROMPT for understanding (Table 14), text simplification (Table 16), summarization (Table 15) and BBH tasks (Table 17, 18) . D F UTURE WORKS There are several promising directions for future investigation: ‚Ä¢ Based on our framework, more applications can be explored, including game levels generation, text-to-images generation, non-trivial NP-hard problems (e.g. traveling salesman problem), etc. ‚Ä¢ There exist many variants of DE and we give priority to the most canonical and classical ones for current exploration. In future work, it will be interesting to consider more advanced DE- variants (Das et al., 2016; Das & Suganthan, 2010). For example, some recent DE-variants have been investigating adaptive control parameters.

Despite being trained with huge corpora, there still exists a substantial gap between user intention and what the model interprets (Zhou et al., 2022; Feng et al., 2022; Rombach et al., 2022; Radford et al., 2021; Lian et al., 2023; Ouyang et al., 2022; Ramesh et al., 2022). The misalignment is even more severe in text-to-image generative models, partially since they often rely on much smaller and less capable text encoders (Radford et al., 2021; Cherti et al., 2023; Raffel et al., 2020) than large language models (LLMs). As a re- sult, instructing a large model to produce intended content often requires laborious human efforts in crafting the prompt through trials and errors (a.k.a. Prompt Engineering) (Art, Year; Wang et al., 2022; Witteveen & Andrews, 2022; Liu & Chilton, 2022; Zhou et al., 2022; Hao et al., 2022). To automate this process for language generation, several re- cent attempts have shown tremendous potential in utilizing LLMs to enhance prompts (Pryzant et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023; Hao et al., 2022). However, efforts on text-to-image genera- tive models remain scarce and preliminary, probably due to the challenges faced by these models‚Äô relatively small text encoders in understanding subtle language cues. DPO-Diff. This paper presents a systematic study of prompt optimization for text-to-image diffusion models. We introduce a novel optimization framework based on the following key observations. 1) Prompt engineering for diffusion models can be formulated as a Discrete Prompt Optimization (DPO-Diff) problem over the space of natural languages. Moreover, the framework can be used to find prompts that either improve (prompt enhancement) or de- stroy (adversarial attack) the generation process, by simply reversing the sign of the objective function. 2) We show that for diffusion models with classifier-free guidance (Ho & Salimans, 2022), improving the image generation process is more effective when optimizing ‚Äúnegative prompts‚Äù (An- drew, 2023; Woolf, 2022) than positive prompts. Beyond the problem formulation of DPO-Diff, where ‚ÄúDiff‚Äù high- lights our focus on text-to-image diffusion models, the main technical contributions of this paper lie in efficient methods 1 arXiv:2407.01606v1  [cs.LG]  27 Jun 2024On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models C LIP Amidst  the  bustling  city,  neon  lights  illuminate  the  vibrant  streets.

DPO-Diff‚Äôs domain space is a discrete search space at the word level to represent prompts. While this space is generic enough to cover any sentence, it is excessively large due to the dominance of words irrelevant to the user input. To alleviate this issue, we design a family of dynamically generated compact search spaces based on relevant word substitutions, for both positive and negative prompts. These subspaces enable efficient search for both prompt enhancement and adversarial attack tasks. Shortcut Text Gradients for DPO-Diff. Solving DPO- Diff with a gradient-based algorithm requires computing the text gradient, i.e., backpropagating from the generated image, through all inference steps of a diffusion model, and finally to the discrete text. Two challenges arise in obtaining this gradient: 1) This process incurs compound memory- runtime complexity over the number of backward passes through the denoising step, making it prohibitive to run on large-scale diffusion models (e.g., a 870M-parameter Stable Diffusion v1 requires ‚àº750G memory to run backpropa- gation through 50 inference steps (Rombach et al., 2022)). 2) The embedding lookup tables in text encoders are non- differentiable. To reduce the computational cost in 1), we provide a generic replacement for the text gradient that by- passes the need to unroll the inference steps in a backward pass, allowing it to be computed with constant memory and runtime. To backpropagate through the discrete embedding lookup table, we continuously relax the categorical word choices to a learnable smooth distribution over the vocabu- lary, using the Gumbel Softmax trick (Guo et al., 2021; Jang et al., 2016; Dong & Yang, 2019). The gradient obtained by this method, termed Shortcut Text Gradient, enables us to efficiently solve DPO-Diff regardless of the number of inference steps of a diffusion model. To evaluate our prompt optimization method for the diffu- sion model, we collect and filter a set of challenging prompts from diverse sources including DiffusionDB (Wang et al., 2022), COCO (Lin et al., 2014), and ChatGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022). Empirical results suggest that DPO-Diff can effectively discover prompts that improve (or destroy for ad- versarial attack) the faithfulness of text-to-image diffusion models, surpassing human-engineered prompts and prior baselines by a large margin. We summarize our primary contributions as follows: ‚Ä¢ DPO-Diff: A generic framework for prompt optimiza- tion as a discrete optimization problem over the space of natural languages, of arbitrary metrics. ‚Ä¢ Compact domain spaces: A family of dynamic compact search spaces, over which a gradient-based algorithm enables efficient solution finding for the prompt optimiza- tion problem. ‚Ä¢ Shortcut Text Gradients: The first novel computation method to enable backpropagation through the diffusion models‚Äô lengthy sampling steps with constant memory- runtime complexity, enabling gradient-based search algo- rithms. ‚Ä¢ Negative prompt optimization: The first empirical re- sult demonstrating the effectiveness of optimizing nega- tive prompts for diffusion models. 2. Related Work Text-to-image diffusion models. Diffusion models trained on a large corpus of image-text datasets significantly advanced the state of text-guided image generation (Rom- bach et al., 2022; Ramesh et al., 2022; Saharia et al., 2022; Chang et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2022). Despite the success, these models can sometimes generate images with poor quality. While some preliminary observations suggest that negative prompts can be used to improve image quality (An- drew, 2023; Woolf, 2022), there exists no principled way to find negative prompts. Moreover, several studies have 2On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models shown that large-scale text-to-image diffusion models face significant challenges in understanding language cues in user input during image generation; Particularly, diffusion models often generate images with missing objects and in- correctly bounded attribute-object pairs, resulting in poor ‚Äúfaithfulness‚Äù or ‚Äúrelevance‚Äù (Hao et al., 2022; Feng et al., 2022; Lian et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2022). Existing solu- tions to this problem include compositional generation (Liu et al., 2022), augmenting diffusion model with large lan- guage models (Yang et al., 2023), and manipulating atten- tion masks (Feng et al., 2022). As a method orthogonal to them, our work reveals that negative prompt optimization can also alleviate this issue. Prompt optimization for text-based generative models. Aligning a pretrained large language model (LLM) with human intentions is a crucial step toward unlocking the po- tential of large-scale text-based generative models (Ouyang et al., 2022; Rombach et al., 2022). An effective line of training-free alignment methods is prompt optimization (PO) (Zhou et al., 2022). PO originated from in-context learning (Dale, 2021), which is mainly concerned with var- ious arrangements of task demonstrations. It later evolves into automatic prompt engineering, where powerful lan- guage models are utilized to refine prompts for certain tasks (Zhou et al., 2022; Pryzant et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023; Pryzant et al., 2023; Hao et al., 2022). While PO has been widely explored for LLMs, efforts on diffusion models remain scarce. The most relevant prior work to ours is Promptist (Hao et al., 2022), which finetunes an LLM via reinforcement learning from human feedback (Ouyang et al., 2022) to augment user prompts with artistic modifiers (e.g., high-resolution, 4K) (Art, Year), resulting in aesthetically pleasing images. However, the lack of paired contextual- aware data significantly limits its ability to follow the user intention (Figure 3). Textual Inversion Optimizing texts in pretrained diffu- sion models has also been explored under ‚ÄúTextual Inver- sion‚Äù task (Gal et al., 2022; Wen et al., 2023; Mokady et al., 2023). Textual Inversion involves adapting a frozen model to generate novel visual concepts based on a set of user- provided images. It achieves this by distilling these images into soft or hard text prompts, enabling the model to repli- cate the visual features of the user images. Since the source images are provided, the training process mirrors that of typical diffusion model training. While some Textual In- version papers also use the term ‚Äúprompt optimization‚Äù, it is distinct from the Prompt Optimization considered by Promptist (Hao et al., 2022) and our work. Our objective is to enhance a model‚Äôs ability to follow text prompts. Here, the primary input is the user prompt, and improvement is achieved by optimizing this prompt to enhance the resulting image. Since the score function is applied to the final gener- ated image, the optimization process necessitates backprop- agation through all inference steps. Despite using similar terminologies, these methodologies are fundamentally dis- tinct and not interchangeable. Table 3 further summarizes the key differences in taxonomy. Efficient Backpropagation through diffusion sampling steps. Text-to-image diffusion models generate images via a progressive denoising process, making multiple passes through the same network (Ho et al., 2020). When a loss is applied to the output image, computing the gradient w.r.t. any model component (text, weight, sampler, etc.) requires backpropagating through all the sampling steps. This pro- cess incurs compound complexity over the number of back- ward passes in both memory and runtime, making it infeasi- ble to run on regular commercial devices. Existing efforts achieve constant memory via gradient checkpointing (Wat- son et al., 2021) or solving an augmented SDE problem (Nie et al., 2022), at the expense of even higher runtime. 3. Preliminaries on diffusion model Denoising diffusion probabilistic models. On a high level, diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) is a type of hierar- chical Variational Autoencoder (S√∏nderby et al., 2016) that generates samples by reversing (backward) a progressive noisification process (forward). Let x0 ¬∑¬∑¬∑ xT be a series of intermediate samples of increasing noise levels, the forward process progressively adds Gaussian noise to the original image x0: q(xt|xt‚àí1) = N(xt; p 1 ‚àí Œ≤txt‚àí1, Œ≤tI), (1) where Œ≤ is a scheduling variable. Using reparameterization trick, xt|T t=1 can be computed from x0 in one step: xt = ‚àö¬ØŒ±tx0 + ‚àö 1 ‚àí ¬ØŒ±tœµ, (2) where Œ±t = 1 ‚àí Œ≤t and ¬ØŒ±t = Yt i=1 Œ±i, (3) where œµ is a standard Gaussian error. The reverse process starts with a standard Gaussian noise, xT ‚àº N(0, I), and progressively denoises it using the following joint distribu- tion: pŒ∏(x0:T ) = p(xT ) YT t=1 pŒ∏(xt‚àí1|xt) where pŒ∏(xt‚àí1|xt) = N(xt‚àí1; ¬µŒ∏(xt, t), Œ£). While the mean function ¬µŒ∏(xt, t) can be parameterized by a neural network (e.g., UNet (Rombach et al., 2022; Ronneberger et al., 2015)) directly, prior studies found that modeling the residual error œµ(xt, t) instead works better em- pirically (Ho et al., 2020). The two strategies are mathemat- ically equivalent as ¬µŒ∏(xt, t) = 1‚àöŒ±t (xt ‚àí 1‚àíŒ±t‚àö1‚àí¬ØŒ±t œµ(xt, t)). 3On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models Conditional generation and negative prompts. The above formulation can be easily extended to conditional gen- eration via classifier-free guidance (Ho & Salimans, 2022), widely adopted in contemporary diffusion models. At each sampling step, the predicted error Àúœµ is obtained by subtract- ing the unconditional signal ( c(‚Äú‚Äù)) from the conditional signal (c(s)), up to a scaling factor w: ÀúœµŒ∏(xt, c(s),t) = (1 + w)œµŒ∏(xt, c(s), t) ‚àí wœµŒ∏(xt, c(‚Äú‚Äù), t). (4) If we replace this empty string with an actual text, then it becomes a Negative Prompt (Andrew, 2023; Woolf, 2022), instructing the model what to exclude from the generated image. 4. DPO-Diff Framework Formulation Our main insight is that prompt engineering can be formulated as a discrete optimization problem in the language space. Concretely, we represent the problem do- main S as a sequence of M words wi from a predefined vocabulary V: S = {w1, w2, . . . wM |‚àÄi, wi ‚àà V}. This space is generic enough to cover all possible sentences of lengths less than M (when the empty string is present). Let G(s) denote a text-to-image generative model, and suser, s denote the user input and optimized prompt, respectively. The optimization problem can be written as min s‚ààS L(G(s), suser) (5) where L can be any objective function that measures the effectiveness of the learned prompt when used to generate images. Following previous works (Hao et al., 2022), we use clip loss CLIP(I, suser) (Crumb, 2022) to measure the instruction-following ability of the diffusion model. Application DPO-Diff framework is versatile for handling not only prompt enhancement but also adversarial attack tasks. Figure 1 illustrates the taxonomy of those two applications. Adversarial attacks for text-to-image generative models can be defined as follows: Definition 4.1. Given a user input suser, the attacker aims at slightly perturbing suser to disrupt the prompt-following ability of image generation, i.e., the resulting generated image is no longer describable by suser. To modify (5) into the adversarial attack, we can simply add a negative sign to the objective function ( L), and restrict the distance between an adversarial prompt ( s) and user input (suser). Mathematically, this can be written as the following: min s‚ààS ‚àíL(G(s), suser) s.t. d(s, suser) ‚â§ Œª, (6) where d(s, suser) is a distance measure that forces the per- turbed prompt (s) to be semantically similar to the user input (suser). 5. Compact search spaces for efficient prompt discovery While the entire language space facilitates maximal gener- ality, it is also unnecessarily inefficient as it is popularized with words irrelevant to the task. We propose a family of compact search spaces that dynamically extracts a subset of task-relevant words to the user input. 5.1. Application 1: Discovering adversarial prompts for model diagnosis Synonym Space for adversarial attack. In light of the constraint on semantic similarity in (6), we build a search space for the adversarial prompts by substituting each word in the user input suser with its synonyms (Alzantot et al., 2018), preserving the meaning of the original sentence. The synonyms can be found by either dictionary lookup or query- ing ChatGPT (Appendix F.2). 5.2. Application 2: Discovering enhanced prompts for image generation While the Synonym Space is suitable for attacking diffu- sion models, we found that it performs poorly on find- ing improved prompts. This is in contradiction to LLMs where rephrasing user prompts can often lead to substan- tial gains (Zhou et al., 2022). One plausible reason is that contemporary diffusion models often rely on small-scale text encoders (Radford et al., 2021; Cherti et al., 2023; Raffel et al., 2020) that are much weaker than LLMs with many known limitations in understanding subtle language cues (Feng et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2023). Antonym Space for negative prompt optimization. In- spired by these observations, we propose a novel solution to optimize for negative prompts instead ‚Äî a unique con- cept that rises from classifier-free guidance (Ho & Sali- mans, 2022) used in diffusion models (Section 3). Recall that negative prompts instruct the diffusion model to re- move contents in generated images, opposite to the pos- itive prompt; Intuitively, the model‚Äôs output image can safely exclude the content with the opposite meaning to the words in the user input, thereby amplifying the con- cepts presented in the positive prompt. We thereby build the space of negative prompts from the antonyms of each word in the user prompt. The antonyms of words can also be obtained either via dictionary lookup or querying ChatGPT. However unlike synonyms space, we concate- nate the antonyms directly in comma separated format, mirroring the practical usage of negative prompts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first exploratory work on 4On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models automated negative prompt optimization. 6. A Gradient-based solver for DPO-Diff Due to the query efficiency of white-box algorithms leverag- ing gradient information, we also explore a gradient-based method to solve (5) and (6). However, obtaining the text gradient is non-trivial due to two major challenges. 1) Back- propagating through the sampling steps of the diffusion inference process incurs high complexity w.r.t. memory and runtime, making it prohibitively expensive to obtain gradi- ents (Watson et al., 2021; Nie et al., 2022). For samplers with 50 inference steps (e.g., DDIM (Song et al., 2020)), it raises the runtime and memory cost by 50 times compared to a single diffusion training step. 2) To further compute the gradient on text, the backpropagation needs to pass through a non-differentiable embedding lookup table. To alleviate these issues, we propose Shortcut Text Gradient, an effi- cient replacement for text gradient that can be obtained with constant memory and runtime. Our solution to (1) and (2) are discussed in Section 6.1.1 and Section 6.1.2 respec- tively. Moreover, Section 6.2 discusses how to sample from the learned text distribution via evolutionary search. 6.1. Shortcut Text Gradient 6.1.1. B ACKPROPAGATING THROUGH DIFFUSION SAMPLING STEPS To efficiently backpropagate the loss from the final image to intermediate feature at an arbitrary step, our key idea is to trim the computation graph down to only a few steps from both ends, resulting in a constant number of back- ward passes (Figure 1. To achieve this, three operations are required through the image generation process: (1) Sampling without gradient from stepT (noise) tot. We disable gradients up to step t, thereby eliminating the need for backpropagation from T to t. (2) Enable gradient fromt to t ‚àí K. The backward compu- tation graph is enabled for the K step starting at t. (3) Estimatingx0 directly fromxt‚àíK. To bypass the fi- nal t ‚àí K steps of UNet, a naive solution is to directly decode and feed the noisy image xt‚àíK to the loss function. However, due to distribution shifts, these intermediate im- ages often cannot be properly interpreted by downstream modules such as V AE decoder (Rombach et al., 2022) and CLIP (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021). Instead, we propose to use the following closed-form estimation of the final image ÀÜx0 (Song et al., 2020) to bridge the gap: ÀÜx0 = 1‚àö¬ØŒ±t‚àíK (xt‚àíK ‚àí p 1 ‚àí ¬ØŒ±t‚àíKÀÜœµŒ∏(xt‚àíK, t‚àí K)) This way, the Jacobian of ÀÜx0 w.r.t. xt‚àíK can be computed analytically, with complexity independent of t. Note that the above estimation of x0 is not a trick ‚Äî it directly comes from a mathematically equivalent interpretation of the dif- fusion model, where each inference step can be viewed as computing ÀÜx0 and plugging it into q(xt‚àíK|xt, ÀÜx0) to ob- tain the transitional probability (See Appendix C for the derivation). Remark 1: Complexity Analysis With Shortcut Text Gra- dient, the computational cost of backpropagating through the inference process can be reduced to K-times backward passes of UNet. When we set t = T and K = T, it becomes the full-text gradient; When K = 1, the computation costs reduce to a single backward pass. Remark 2: Connection to ReFL (Xu et al., 2024). ReFL is a post-hoc alignment method for finetuning diffusion models. It also adopts the estimation of x0 when optimizing diffusion model against a scorer, which is mathematically equivalent to the case when K = 1. 6.1.2. B ACKPROPAGATING THROUGH EMBEDDINGS LOOKUP TABLE In diffusion models, a tokenizer transforms text input into indices, which will be used to query a lookup table for cor- responding word embeddings. To allow further propagating gradients through this non-differentiable indexing operation, we relax the categorical choice of words into a continuous probability of words and learn a distribution over them. We parameterize the distribution using Gumbel Softmax (Jang et al., 2016) with uniform temperature (Œ∑ = 1): Àúe = |V|X i=1 ei ‚àó exp ((logŒ±i + gi)/Œ∑) P|V| i=1 exp ((logŒ±i + gi)/Œ∑) (7) where Œ± (a |V|-dimensional vector) denotes the learnable parameter, g denotes the Gumbel random variable, ei is the embedding of word i, and Àúe is the output mixed embedding. 6.2. Efficient sampling with Evolutionary Search To efficiently sample candidate prompts from the learned Gumbel ‚Äúdistribution‚Äù, we adopt evolutionary search, known for its sample efficiency (Goldberg, 1989; Wu et al., 2019). Our adaptation of the evolutionary algorithm to the prompt optimization task involves three key steps: (1) Genotype Definition: We define the genotype of each can- didate prompt as the list of searched words from the compact search space, where modifications to the genotype corre- spond to edits the word choices in the prompt. (2) Popula- tion Initialization: We initialize the algorithm‚Äôs population with samples drawn from the learned Gumbel distribution to bias the starting candidates towards regions of high poten- tial. (3) Evolutionary Operations: We execute a standard evolutionary search, including several rounds of crossover and mutation (Goldberg, 1989), culminating in the selection 5On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models Figure 2: Win Rate of DPO-Diff versus Promptist on prompt improvement task with Human Evaluation. DPO-Diff surpasses or matches the performance of Promptist 79% of times on SD-v1 and 88% of times on SD-XL. of the top candidate as the optimized prompt. Details of the complete DPO-Diff algorithm, including specific hyperpa- rameters, are available in Algorithm 1 of Appendix D and discussed further in Appendix F.1. Remark: Extending DPO-Diff to Blackbox Settings. In cases where the model is only accessible through forward API, our Evolutionary Search (ES) module can be used as a stand-alone black-box optimizer, thereby expanding the applicability of our framework. As further ablated in Section 8.1, ES archives descent results with enough queries. 7. Experiments 7.1. Experimental Setup Dataset preparation. To encourage semantic diver- sity, we collect a prompt dataset from three sources: DiffusionDB (Wang et al., 2022), ChatGPT generated prompts (Ouyang et al., 2022), and COCO (Lin et al., 2014). For each source, we filter 100 ‚Äúhard prompts‚Äù with a clip loss higher (lower for adversarial attack) than a threshold, amounting to 600 prompts in total for two tasks. Due to space limit, we include preparation details in Appendix G.1. Evaluation Metrics. All methods are evaluated quantita- tively using the clip loss (Crowson et al., 2022) and Human Preference Score v2 (HPSv2). HPSv2 is a CLIP-based model trained to predict human preferences on images gen- erated from text. For base models, we adoptStable Diffusion v1-4. Each prompt is evaluated under two random seeds (shared across different methods). Besides automatic eval- uation metrics, we also conduct human evaluations on the generated images, following the protocol specified in Appendix G.2. Optimization Parameters. We use the Spherical CLIP Loss (Crumb, 2022) as the objective function, which ranges Table 1: Quantitative comparison of different prompt- ing methods. We evaluate the generated images using both Spherical CLIP loss and Human Preference Score v2 (HPSv2) score (renormalized to 0-100) - a score trained to mimic human preferences on images generated from text. Our method achieves the best result on both prompt improvement and adversarial attack among all methods, including the previous SOTA - Promptist.

The K for the Shortcut Text Gradient is set to 1, as it produces effective supervision signals with minimal cost. To generate the search spaces, we prompt ChatGPT (gpt-4-1106-preview) for at most 5 substitutes of each word in the user prompt. Furthermore, we use a fixed set of hyperparameters for both prompt improvement and adversarial attacks. We include a detailed discussion on all the hyperparameters and search space generation in Appendix F. 7.2. Application 1 - Adversarial Attack Unlike RLHF-based prompt-engineering methods (e.g. Promptist (Hao et al., 2022)) that require finetuning a prompt generator when adapting to a new task, DPO-Diff, as a train- free method, can be seamlessly applied to finding adversar- ial prompts by simply reversing the sign of the objective function. In this section, we demonstrate that DPO-Diff is capable of discovering adversarial prompts that destroy the prompt- following ability of Stable Diffusion. As suggested by (6), a successful adversarial prompt must not change the original intention of the user prompt. While we specified this constraint to ChatGPT when building the Synonyms Space, occasionally ChatGPT might mistake a word for the synonyms. To address this, during the evolu- tionary search phase, we perform rejection sampling to refuse candidate prompts that have different meanings to the user input. Concretely, we enforce their cosine sim- ilarity in embedding space to be higher than 0.9 (More on this can be found in Appendix G). Table 1 summarizes the quantitative results. Our method is able to perturb the original prompt to adversarial directions, resulting in a substantial increase in the clip loss. Figure 4 also visualizes a set of intriguing images generated by the adversarial prompts. We can see that DPO-Diff can ef- 6On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models User Input Promptist - Modifiers Negative Prompts by DPO-Diff The yellow sun was descending beyond the violet peaks, coloring the sky with hot shades. by Greg Rutkowski and Raymond Swanland, ..., ultra realistic digital art red, soaring, red, valleys, white, floor, Plain, body, focus, surreal A dedicated gardener tending to a ... bonsai tree. intricate, elegant, highly detailed, ..., sharp focus, illustration irresponsible, overlooking, huge, herb, ... magical ... bear with glowing magical marks ...

While keeping the overall meaning similar to the user input, adversarial prompts completely destroy the prompt-following ability of the Stable Diffusion model. (More in Figure 8) 7On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models fectively explore the text regions where Stable Diffusion fails to interpret. Human Evaluation. We further ask human judges to check whether the attack generated by DPO-Diff is suc- cessful or not. Since previous prompt optimization methods do not apply to this task, we only ask the evaluators to compare DPO-Diff against the original image. DPO-Diff achieves an average success rate (ASR) of 44% on SD-v1. Considering that Stable Diffusion models are trained on a large amount of caption corpus, this success rate is fairly substantial. 7.3. Application 2: Prompt Improvement In this section, we apply DPO-Diff to craft prompts that improve the prompt-following ability of the generated im- ages. We compare our method with three baselines: (1) User Input. (2) Human Engineered Prompts (available only on DiffusionDB) (Wang et al., 2022). (3) Promptist (Hao et al., 2022), trained to mimic the human-crafted prompt provided in DiffusionDB. Table 1 summarizes the result. Among all methods, DPO- Diff achieves the best results under both Spherical CLIP loss and Human Preference Score (HPSv2) score. On the other hand, our findings suggest that both human-engineered and Promptist-optimized prompts do not improve the relevance between generated images and user intention. The reason is that these methods merely add a set of aesthetic modifiers to the original prompt, irrelevant to the semantics of user input. This can be further observed from the qualitative examples in Figure 3, where images generated by Promptist often also do not follow the prompts well. Human Evaluation. We further ask human judges to rate DPO-Diff and Promptist on how well the generated images follow the user prompt. Figure 2 summarizes the win/draw/loss rate of DPO-Diff against Promptist; The re- sult shows that DPO-Diff surpasses or matches Promp- tist in human rate 79% of times on SD-v1. 7.4. Qualitative analysis of search progression To examine the convergence of our search algorithm qual- itatively, we plot the progression of optimized images at various evaluation stages. We set the target iterations at 0 (the original image), 10, 20, 40, and 80 to illustrate the changes, and showcase the image with the highest clip loss among all evaluated candidates at each iteration. Figure 5 illustrates some example trajectories. In most cases, the images exhibit noticeable improvement in aligning with the user‚Äôs prompt at as early as the 10th iteration, and con- tinue to improve. Moreover, the progression are surprisingly interpretable. For instance, with the prompt: ‚ÄùA bunch of User Prompt: A bunch of luggage that is in front of a truck.

Noticeable improvements can be observed as early as 10 iterations, and the progression is surprisingly interpretable. luggage in front of a truck,‚Äù the initial image fails to include any luggage, featuring only the truck; However, as the opti- mization continues, we can see that DPO-Diff incrementally adds more luggage to the scene. 8. Ablation Study We conduct ablation studies on DPO-Diff using 30 ran- domly sampled prompts, 10 from each source. Each search algorithm is run under 4 random seeds. 8.1. Comparison of different search algorithms. We compare four search algorithms for DPO-Diff: Ran- dom Search (RS), Evolution Prompt Optimization (EPO), Gradient-based Prompt Optimization (GPO), and the full algorithm (GPO + ES). Figure 6 shows their performance under different search budgets (number of evaluations) 1; While GPO tops EPO under low budgets, it also plateaus quicker as randomly drawing from the learned distribution is sample-inefficient. Combining GPO with EPO achieves the best overall performance. 8.2. Negative prompt v.s. positive prompt optimization One finding in our work is that optimizing negative prompts (Antonyms Space) is more effective than positive prompts (Synonyms Space) for Stable Diffusion. To verify the strength of these spaces, we randomly sample 100 prompts for each space and compute their average clip loss of gener- ated images. Table 2 suggests that Antonyms Space contains 1Since the runtime of backpropagation through one-step dif- fusion sampling is negligible w.r.t. the full sampling process (50 steps for DDIM sampler), we count it the same as one inference step. 8On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models 0 20 40 60 80 Number of Evaluations (1 eval = 50 DDIM steps) 0.80 0.82 0.84 0.86 0.88 0.90Clip loss Random Search Evolutionary Prompt Optimization Gradient Prompt Optimization Hybrid (GPO + EPO) 0 20 40 60 80 Number of Evaluations (1 eval = 50 DDIM steps) 0.80 0.81 0.82 0.83 0.84 0.85 0.86Clip loss Random Search Evolutionary Prompt Optimization Gradient Prompt Optimization Hybrid (GPO + EPO) Figure 6: Learning curves of different search algorithms in solving DPO-Diff.

Discussion on the Search v.s. Learning paradigms for utilizing computatons This section elucidates the relationship between two distinct prompt optimization approaches for diffusion models: DPO- Diff (ours) and Promptist. While Promptist represents a pioneering effort, it is important to discuss why DPO-Diff remains essential. Limitations of Promptist Promptist utilizes the Rein- forcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Bain & Sammut, 1995; Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022) approach to fine-tune a language model to gen- erate improved prompts. RLHF relies on paired data ‚ü®user prompt, improved prompt‚ü©, which is scarce for dif- fusion models and challenging to curate. This is primarily because generating the improved prompts requires extensive trial-and-error by human experts, essentially performing what DPO-Diff automates. In fact, the performance limit exhibited by Promptist is exactly caused by this lack of data: The data used by Promptist from DiffusionDB pre- dominantly features aesthetic modifiers that do not alter the semantics of the prompts This limits its effectiveness to aesthetic enhancements and not addressing the core need for semantic accuracy in prompts. Consequently, it strug- gles with semantic prompt adherence and lacks flexibility in modifying prompts for tasks such as adversarial attacks. Two complementary computational paradigms Promp- tist and DPO-Diff represent two major paradigms for ef- fectively utilizing computation: learning and searching, respectively (Sutton, 2019). Learning-based approach of Promptist enhances performance through more parameters and larger datasets, whereas the search-based approach of DPO-Diff focuses on maximizing the potential of pretrained models via post-hoc optimization. Although learning-based methods require high quality paired data, they can be effi- ciently deployed once trained; On the other hand, search- based methods generate high quality prompts, but are much slower to execute. Therefore, as Sutton (2019) highlights, these paradigms are complementary rather than competitive. DPO-Diff can be leveraged to generate high quality dataset offline, which can subsequently train Promptist to reduce in- ference latency effectively. Together, they pave the way for a comprehensive solution to prompt optimization for diffu- sion models, positioning DPO-Diff as the first search-based solution to address this problem. 10. Conclusions This work presents DPO-Diff, the first gradient-based frame- work for optimizing discrete prompts. We formulate prompt optimization as a discrete optimization problem over the text space. To improve the search efficiency, we introduce a family of compact search spaces based on relevant word substitutions, as well as design a generic computational method for computing the discrete text gradient for diffu- sion model‚Äôs inference process. DPO-Diff is generic - We demonstrate that it can be directly applied to effectively discover both refined prompts to aid image generation and adversarial prompts for model diagnosis. We hope that the proposed framework helps open up new possibilities in developing advanced prompt optimization methods for text-based image generation tasks. Limitations To motivate future work, we discuss the known limitations of DPO-Diff in Appendix A. 9On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models Acknowledgements The work is partially supported by NSF 2048280, 2331966, 2325121, 2244760, ONR N00014-23-1-2300, and finished during the primary contributor‚Äôs internship at Google.

Large language models are human-level prompt engineers. arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.01910, 2022. 12On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models A. Limitations We identify the following known limitations of the proposed method: Search cost Our method requires multiple passes through the diffusion model to optimize a given prompt, which incurs a modest amount of search costs. One promising solution is to use DPO-Diff to generate free paired data for RLHF (e.g. Promptist), which we leave for future work to explore. Text encoder moreover, while DPO-Diff improves the faithfulness of the generated image, the performance is upper-bounded by the limitations of the underlying text encoder. For example, the clip text encoder used in stable diffusion tends to discard spatial relationships in text, which in principle must be resolved by improving the model itself, such as augmenting the diffusion model with a powerful LLM (Lian et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2022; Feng et al., 2022). Clip loss The clip loss used in DPO-Diff might not always align with human evaluation. Automatic scoring metrics that better reflect human judgment, similar to the reward models used in instruction fine-tuning, can further aid the discovery of improved prompts. Synonyms generated by ChatGPT For adversarial attack task, ChatGPT sometimes generate incorrect synonyms. Although we use reject-sampling based on sentence embedding similarity as a posthoc fix, it is not completely accurate. This may impact the validity of adversarial prompts, as by definition they must preserve the user‚Äôs original intent. We address this in human evaluation by asking the raters to consider this factor when determining the success of an attack. B. Benefit of optimizing discrete text prompts over soft prompts Optimizing discrete text prompts offers two major advantages over tuning soft prompts, primarily in two areas: (1) Interpretability: The results of discrete prompt optimization are texts that are naturally human interpretable. This also facilitates direct use in fine-tuning RLHF-based agents like Promptist. (2) Simplified Search Space: Our preliminary attempts with continuous text embeddings revealed challenges in achieving convergence, even on toy examples. The reason, we conjecture was that the gradients backpropagated through the denoising process have low info-to-noise ratio; And updating soft prompt using such gradient could be very unstable due to its huge continuous search space. In contrast, discrete prompt optimization effectively narrows the search to a finite vocabulary set, greatly reducing search complexity and improving stability. C. Derivation for the alternative interpretation of DDPM‚Äôs modeling. Proposition C.1. The original parameterization of DDPM at step t ‚àí K: ¬µŒ∏(xt‚àíK, t‚àí K) = 1‚àöŒ±t‚àíK (xt‚àíK ‚àí Œ≤t‚àíK‚àö 1‚àí¬ØŒ±t‚àíK œµŒ∏(xt‚àíK, t‚àíK)) can be viewed as first computing an estimate ofx0 from the current-step errorÀÜœµŒ∏(xt‚àíK, t‚àíK): ÀÜx0 = 1‚àö¬ØŒ±t‚àíK (xt‚àíK ‚àí p 1 ‚àí ¬ØŒ±t‚àíKÀÜœµŒ∏(xt‚àíK, t‚àí K)) And use the estimate to compute the transition probability q(xt‚àíK|xt‚àíK, x0). Proof. To avoid clustered notations, we uset instead of t ‚àí K for the proof below. Starting from reorganizing (3) to the one step estimation: ÀÜx0 = 1‚àö¬ØŒ±t (xt ‚àí ‚àö 1 ‚àí ¬ØŒ±tÀÜœµŒ∏(xt, t)) (8) where ÀÜœµŒ∏ is the predicted error at step t by the network. Intuitively this equation means to use the current predicted error to one-step estimate x0. Using the Bayesian Theorem, one can show that q(xt‚àíK|xt, ÀÜx0) = N(xt‚àí1; Àú¬µ(xt, x0), ÀúŒ≤tI) (9) Àú¬µ(xt, x0) = ‚àö¬ØŒ±t‚àí1Œ≤t 1 ‚àí ¬ØŒ±t x0 + ‚àöŒ±t(1 ‚àí ¬ØŒ±t‚àí1) 1 ‚àí ¬ØŒ±t xt (10) If we plug ÀÜx0 into the above equation, it becomes: ¬µŒ∏(xt, t) = 1‚àöŒ±t (xt ‚àí Œ≤t‚àö1 ‚àí ¬ØŒ±t œµŒ∏(xt, t)) (11) which is identical to the original modeling of DDPM (Ho et al., 2020). 13On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models Algorithm 1 DPO-Diff solver: Discrete Prompt Optimization Algorithm Require: User Input suser, diffusion model G(¬∑), a loss function L(I, s), learning rate lr.

F. Implementation details F.1. Hyperparameters This section details the hyperparameter choices for our experiments. We use the same set of hyperparameters for all datasets and tasks (prompt improvement and adversarial attack), unless otherwise specified. Model We use Stable Diffusion v1-4 with a DDIM sampler for all experiments in the main paper. The guidance scale and inference steps are set to 7.5 and 50 respectively (default). We also experimented with other versions, such as Stable Diffusion v2-1 (512 x 512 resolution) and v2 (786x786 resolution), and found that the results are similar across different versions. Although, we note that the high-resolution version of v2 tends to produce moderately better original images than v1-4 and v2-1 in terms of clip loss, possibly due to sharper images. Shortcut Text Gradient We set K = 1, corresponding to a 1-step Shortcut Text Gradient. This minimizes the memory and runtime cost while empirically producing enough signal to guide the prompt optimization. Throughout the entire optimization episode, we progressively increase t from 15 to 25 via a fixed stepwise function. This corresponds to a coarse-to-fine learning curriculum. We note that the performance is only marginally affected by the choice of the upper and lower bound for t (e.g. 20-30, 10-40 all produce similar results), as long as it avoids values near 0 (diminishing gradient) and T (excessively noisy). 14On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models Gumbel softmax We use Gumbel Softmax with temperature 1. The learnable parameters are initialized to 1 for the original word (for positive prompts) and empty string (for negative prompts), and 0 otherwise. To encourage exploration. We bound the learnable parameters within 0 and 3 via hard clipping. The performance remains largely incentive to the choice of bound, as long as they are in a reasonable range (i.e. not excessively small or large). Optimization We optimize DPO-Diff using RMSprop with a learning rate of 0.1 and momentum of 0.5 for 20 iterations. Each iteration will produce a single Gumbel Sample (batch size = 1) to compute the gradient, which will be clipped to 1/40. clip loss The specific clip loss used in our experiment is spherical clip loss, following an early online implementation of clip-guided diffusion (Crumb, 2022): spherical clip(x, y) = 2 ¬∑ \u0012 arcsin ‚à•x ‚àí y‚à•2 2 \u00132 Note that our method does not rely on this specific choice to function; We also experimented with other distance measures such as cos similarity on the clip embedding space, and found that they produced nearly identical prompts (and thus images). Evolution Search We follow a traditional evolution search composed of four steps: initialize population, tournament, mutation, and crossover. The specific choice of hyperparameters is population size = 20, tournament = top 10, mutation with prob = 0.1 and size = 10, and crossover with size = 10. We run the evolutionary search for two iterations for both tasks, while we note that the prompt improvement task often covers much faster (within a single iteration). F.2. Search space construction We construct our Synonyms and Antonyms space by querying ChatGPT using the following prompts. Since ChatGPT sometimes makes mistakes by producing false synonyms or antonyms, we further filter candidate prompts by thresholding the cosine similarity between adversarial prompts and user prompts in the embedding space of T5 during the evolutionary search phase (Raffel et al., 2020). The threshold is set to 0.9 for all datasets. Read the next paragraph. For each word, give 5 substitution words that do not change the meaning. Use the format of ‚ÄùA ‚Üí B‚Äù. For Antonyms: Read the next paragraph. For each word, give 5 opposite words if it has any. Use the format of ‚ÄùA ‚Üí B‚Äù. G. More experimental settings G.1. Dataset Collection The prompts used in our paper are collected from three sources, DiffusionDB, COCO, and ChatGPT. DiffusionDB DiffusionDB is a giant prompt database comprised of 2m highly diverse prompts for text-to-image generation. Since these prompts are web-crawled, they are highly noisy, often containing incomplete phrases, emojis, random characters, non-imagery prompts, etc (We refer the reader to its HuggingFace repo for an overview of the entire database.). Therefore, we filter prompts from DiffusionDB by (1). asking ChatGPT to determine whether the prompt is complete and describes an image, and (2) remove emoji-only prompts. We filter a total of 4,000 prompts from DiffusionDB and use those prompts to generate images via Stable Diffusion. We sample 100 prompts with clip loss above 0.85 for prompt improvement, and 0.8 for adversarial attacks respectively. For ChatGPT, we found that it tends to produce prompts with much lower clip score compared with COCO and DiffusionDB. To ensure a sufficient amount of prompts from this source is included in the dataset, we lower the cutoff threshold to 0.82 when filtering its hard prompts for the prompt improvement task. COCO We use the captions from the 2014 validation split of MS-COCO dataset as prompts. Similar to DiffusionDB, we filter 4000 prompts, and further sample 100 prompts with clip loss above 0.85 for prompt improvement, and 0.8 for adversarial attack respectively. 15On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models ChatGPT We also query ChatGPT for descriptions, as we found that it tends to produce more vivid and poetic descriptions compared with the former sources. We use a diverse set of instructions for this task. Below are a few example prompts we used to query ChatGPT for image descriptions. Generate N diverse sentences describing photoes/pictures/images Generate N diverse sentences describing images with length around 10 Generate N diverse sentences describing images with length around 20 Generate N diverse sentences describing images using simple words Generate N diverse sentences describing images using fancy words Below are some example prompts returned by ChatGPT: A majestic waterfall cascades down a rocky cliff into a clear pool below, surrounded by lush greenery. The sun setting behind the mountains casting a warm orange glow over the tranquil lake. A pair of bright red, shiny high heels sit on a glossy wooden floor, with a glittering disco ball above. A farmer plowing a field with a tractor. The vivid orange and dark monarch butterfly was flapping through the atmosphere, alighting on a flower to sip nectar. We empirically observe that ChatGPT produces prompts with low clip loss when used to generate images through Stable Diffusion on average, compared with DiffusionDB and COCO. Therefore, for filtering challenging prompts, we reduce the threshold from 0.85 to 0.82 to allow more prompts to be selected. G.2. Human Evaluation We ask 5 judges without ML background to evaluate the faithfulness of the generated images. For each prompt, we generate two images using the same seeds across different methods. To further avoid subjectiveness in evaluation, we provide the judgers an ordered list of important key concepts for each prompt, and ask them to find the winning prompt by comparing the hit rate. The ordered list of key concepts is provided by ChatGPT. Since the 600 prompts used in the main experiments are filtered automatically via clip loss, they exhibit a certain level of false positive rate: some images are actually faithful. Therefore, we further filter out 100 most broken prompts to be evaluated by human judgers. Special treatment for Adversarial Attack task. When conducting human evaluation on adversarial attack tasks, we make the following adjustments to the protocol: (1). The wins and losses are reversed (2) There will be no ‚Äùdraw‚Äù, as this counts as a failed attempt. (3). Removing meaning-altering successes: we asked the human evaluators to identify cases where success is achieved only because the adversarial prompt changed the meaning of the user prompt. Such instances are categorized as failures. The results of our evaluation showcase that DPO-Diff achieved a success rate of 44%, thereby establishing itself as the only baseline for this particular task on diffusion models. H. Extra qualitative results We include extra quantitative results of DPO-Diff in Figure 7 and Figure 8. Additionally, we conducted experiments with the latest SD-XL model, as illustrated in Figure 10. The results indicate that DPO-Diff also achieves significant improvements with more advanced diffusion models. 16On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models Figure 7: More images generated by user input versus improved negative prompts using Stable Diffusion v1-4.

We plot the average gradient norm over all words across different timesteps. For each timestep, the Shortcut Text Gradient is computed over 100 Gumbel samples. I. Further discussion on Gradient-based Prompt Optimization The computational cost of the Shortcut Text Gradient is controlled by K. Moreover, when we set t = T and K = T ‚àí 1, it becomes the full-text gradient. The result of remark 2 is rather straightforward: recall that the image generation process starts with a random noise xT and gradually denoising it to the final image x0. Since the gradient is enabled from t to t ‚àí K in Shortcut Text Gradient; when t = T and K = T, it indicates that gradient is enabled from T to 0, which covers the entire inference process. In this case, the Shortcut Text Gradient reduces to the full gradient on text. J. Extra ablation study results. J.1. Gradient norm v.s. timestep. When randomly sampling t in computing the Shortcut Text Gradient, we avoid timesteps near the beginning and the end of the image generation process, as gradients at those places are not informative. As we can see, for both adversarial attack and prompt improvement, the gradient norm is substantially smaller near t = T and especially t = 0, compared with timesteps in the middle. The reason, we conjecture, is that the images are almost pure noise at the beginning, and are almost finalized towards the end. Figure 9 shows the empirical gradient norm across different timesteps. J.2. Extended discussion on different search algorithms In our experiments, we found that Gradient-based Prompt Optimization converges faster at the early stage of the optimization. This result confirms the common belief that white-box algorithms are more query efficient than black-box algorithms in several other machine learning fields, such as adversarial attack (Ilyas et al., 2018; Cheng et al., 2018). However, when giving a sufficient amount of query, Evolutionary Search eventually catches up and even outperforms GPO. The reason, we conjecture, is that GPO uses random search to draw candidates from the learned distribution, which bottlenecked its sample efficiency at later stages. This promotes the hybrid algorithm used in our experiments: Using Evolutionary Search to sample from the learned distribution of GPO. The hybrid algorithm achieves the best overall convergence. J.3. Extended discussion on negative v.s. positive prompt optimization As discussed in the main text, one of our highlighted findings of is that optimizing for negative prompts is more effective than positive prompts in improving the prompt-following ability of diffusion models. This is evidenced by Table 2, which shows that Antonym Space contains a denser population of promising prompts (lower clip loss) than positive spaces. Such search space also allows the search algorithm to identify an improved prompt more easily. We conjecture that this might indicate diffusion models are more sensitive to changes in negative prompts than positive prompts, as the baseline negative prompt is merely an empty string. 19On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models Figure 10: Images generated by user input and improved negative prompts on Stable Diffusion XL.

They can be further improved towards a specific task by fine-tuning on a specialized dataset. However, fine-tuning usually makes the model narrowly specialized on this dataset with reduced general in-context learning performances, which is undesirable whenever the fine-tuned model needs to handle additional tasks where no fine-tuning data is available. In this work, we first demonstrate that fine-tuning on a single task indeed decreases LLMs‚Äô general in-context learning performance. We discover one important cause of such forgetting, format specialization, where the model overfits to the format of the fine-tuned task. We further show that format specialization happens at the very beginning of fine-tuning. To solve this problem, we propose Prompt Tuning with MOdel Tuning (ProMoT), a simple yet effective two-stage fine-tuning framework that reduces format specialization and improves generalization. ProMoT offloads task-specific format learning into additional and removable parameters by first doing prompt tuning and then fine-tuning the model itself with this soft prompt attached. With experiments on several fine-tuning tasks and 8 in-context evaluation tasks, we show that ProMoT achieves comparable performance on fine-tuned tasks to standard fine-tuning, but with much less loss of in-context learning performances across a board range of out-of-domain evaluation tasks. More importantly, ProMoT can even enhance generalization on in-context learning tasks that are semantically related to the fine-tuned task, e.g. ProMoT on En-Fr translation significantly improves performance on other language pairs, and ProMoT on NLI improves performance on summarization. Experiments also show that ProMoT can improve the generalization performance of multi-task training. 1 I NTRODUCTION Natural language processing (NLP) has recently been revolutionized by scaling up transformer based large language models (LLMs) together with large-scale pretraining (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020a; Brown et al., 2020; Rae et al., 2021; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023). In addition to improved downstream performances, these pretrained LLMs can perform a broad array of unforeseen tasks when provided with a prompt. This in-context ‚àó Work done while at Google. 1 arXiv:2211.00635v3  [cs.CL]  12 Mar 2024Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 learning capability allows users to flexibly re-purpose LLMs for specific tasks with a minimum amount of supervised data, making it extremely convenient for fast prototyping and experimentation, especially in the low data regime. However, even the largest and most advanced LLMs leave a lot to be improved. Grounding and eliminating hallucinations (Maynez et al., 2020), reasoning and logical clarity (Creswell & Shanahan, 2022), mathematics (Brown et al., 2020; Noorbakhsh et al., 2021) are just a few examples where LLMs still lag behind the best human performances, or in some cases, the fine-tuned performances of the same model. The most common practice to improve a pretrained model is to fine-tune it on a specialized task or several tasks. However, fine-tuning on LLM usually causes over-specialization to the fine-tuning tasks, and harm the model‚Äôs pre-existing generalization ability on unseen tasks via in-context learning. As we show later, an mT5 model finetuned on a single task loses its few-shot performance on unseen tasks within one thousand steps of fine-tuning. When faced with hundreds of downstream tasks and even unknown tasks, we expect to have a single fine-tuned model that is both superior on supervised fine-tuned tasks and general unseen tasks. Thus, it becomes very important to develop new techniques for finetuning that prevent over-specialization of these fine-tuned models only to a few tasks. Ground-Truth Output Mercedes‚Äô Lewis Hamilton took the outright championship lead for the first time this season with a dominant victory in theItalianGrand Prix. Pretrained mT5 Hamilton won theBritishGrand Prix. Fine-tuned mT5 on RTE True Fine-tuned mT5 with ProMoT (Ours) on RTELewis Hamilton won theItalianGrand Prix. Table 1: Output comparison of pretrained and fine-tuned mT5 models vs. fine-tuned with ProMoT on the RTE binary classification NLI dataset, performing in-context 1-shot summarization. In this work, we discover that the loss of general in-context learning abilities during fine-tuning is, to a large extent, caused by format specialization, which makes model overfitting to the specific task format. For example, an mT5 (Xue et al., 2020) model learns in the output space with only ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù and ‚ÄúFalse‚Äù if we fine-tune it on a binary classification dataset, losing its ability to flexibly generate different output styles according to the in-context prompts of other tasks. We show that format specialization tends to happen at the very beginning of fine-tuning, before the model fully learns the semantic content of the task. Based on these observations, we propose a simple solution to alleviate format specialization: PROmpt Tuning with MOdel Tuning (ProMoT), which off-loads format learning to a small amount of task- specific parameters that are external to the model. ProMoT is a two-stage fine-tuning process. At the first stage, we freeze the pretrained model and tune a small set of additional parameters, where we find adding soft prompt before the input (Lester et al., 2021) is a good choice. At the second stage, we freeze the additional parameters and tune the main model. Since format information is learned first, it mostly enters the small set of additional parameters. At inference time, we can decide whether to remove the additional parameters depending on whether the incoming task share the same format as the fine-tuned task. Our experiments show that ProMoT significantly alleviates specialization during fine-tuning, while boosting generalization on semantically related tasks with different formats. For example, fine-tuning the model only on an NLI binary classification dataset, a mT5 XXL model consistently obtains improved in-context learning performance on summarization compared with the pretrained model, possibly due to improved grounding learned from NLI. See Table 1 for a concrete example. With ProMoT, we can obtain models with both better supervised performance compared to pretrained models and better general in-context learning performance compared to standard finetuning. To summarize, our contributions are 4-fold: ‚Ä¢ We show empirically that general in-context learning capabilities decrease during single-task fine-tuning for T5 models. We identify format specialization as one of the important causes which mostly happens at the beginning of fine-tuning. ‚Ä¢ We propose a novel 2-stage fine-tuning framework: PROmpt Tuning with MOdel Tuning (ProMoT) to reduce format specialization during fine-tuning. 2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 ‚Ä¢ Experiments on 10+ NLP tasks show that ProMoT significantly reduces specialization of fine-tuned models compared to standard fine-tuning, while reaching similar supervised per- formance. The reduction in specialization opens up opportunities to enhance generalization across very dissimilar tasks when they share some semantic aspects. ‚Ä¢ ProMoT can be combined with many existing fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. We show examples where ProMoT is combined with multi-task fine-tuning and fine-tuning with 1-shot prompts to further boost the generalization on unseen tasks. 2 R ELATED WORK Pretrained LLMs are general problem solvers with in-context prompts (Raffel et al., 2020b; Xue et al., 2020; Radford et al., 2018; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Min et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023). Zhai et al. (2023) evaluates the catastrophic forgetting in multimodal language model fine-tuning, which is limited to image classification tasks. Chan et al. (2022); Gao et al. (2020) study the effect of pretraining data distribution on in-context learning on image recognition tasks, where the tension between in-context learning tasks and fine-tuning tasks is discussed. They propose changing the data distribution to ease such tension, which could be difficult for generative NLP tasks. ProMoT is an orthogonal method that does not require changes in data distribution. In a recent study, Ramasesh et al. (2022) found that as model size increases, the model becomes less prone to catastrophic forgetting. However such studies are mostly focused on tasks of similar format, e.g. a sequence of different classification tasks. In this work we explore vastly different tasks, e.g. classification v.s. long form generation where the format itself is critical. Different from full fine-tuning, prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021), adapters and LoRA (Hu et al., 2021; He et al., 2021; Houlsby et al., 2019) adapt a pretrained model to a task with a small set of tunable parameters. Parameter-efficient methods like these largely leave the pretrained model intact, which can preserve the pre-existing in-context learning abilities. However, they also miss the opportunity to further improve the pretrained model with a small, high quality dataset that generalizes beyond the fine-tuned task. Besides, these parameter-efficient methods also underperform fine-tuning on the supervised task in many cases, as shown in (Lester et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021) and in our results. Another line of work uses multi-task fine-tuning to improve generalization on unseen in-context learning tasks. Wei et al. (2021a); Chung et al. (2022) fine-tune PaLM and T5 on large-scale multitask datasets with diverse natural language prompts, improving the zero- and few-shot performance on unseen tasks. Min et al. (2021) incorporate the in-context learning objective into fine-tuning on multitask datasets with few-shot prompts. This approach relies on multi-task training to generalize, while orthogonally, ProMoT improves the generalization of each single fine-tuning task, whether used in a multi-task setting or not. ProMoT can indeed be combined with multi-task training to obtain better generalization as we demonstrate in Sec. 5.4. In addition, such approaches often require human engineered instructions or prompts for each task to partly alleviate format specialization, while ProMoT uses prompt tuning, which has two advantages: 1) ProMoT does not require the elaborate trial and error of prompt engineering as it optimizes the soft prompts with data. 2) Soft prompts are more effective at absorbing the format compared to natural language prompts, as shown in Table 6. 3 F ORMAT SPECIALIZATION IN FINE -TUNING CAUSES THE LOSS OF IN-CONTEXT LEARNING CAPABILITIES In this section, we first show empirically with an mT5 XXL model that 1) in-context learning abilities are lost during fine-tuning; 2) format specialization is an important cause for such loss; 3) format specialization happens at the very beginning of fine-tuning. 3.1 L OSS OF IN -CONTEXT LEARNING CAPABILITIES DURING FINE -TUNING In this subsection, we first show that the in-context learning performance usually drops significantly after standard fine-tuning. In our experiments, we fine-tune a pretrained mT5 XXL model (13B parameters) (Xue et al., 2020) on the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) dataset (Wang et al., 2019). In RTE tasks, the model is required to predict ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù or ‚ÄúFalse‚Äù for whether the two given sentences are entailed. We fine-tune 3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 the mT5 model with default hyper-parameters and input/output template used in PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022). 0 50 100150200250300350400450500 Fine-tune steps 0 20 40 60 80 100 120Accuracy RTE 0 5 10 15 20 25 Exact match 1-shot triviaQA 1-shot web_questions Figure 1: Loss of in-context learning abili- ties during fine-tuning.

The model is being fine-tuned on RTE. Left axis: Accuracy on RTE. Right axis: Ratio of True/False. We want to see whether the model lost its in-context learning abilities on unseen task during fine- tuning. Therefore, we evaluate the fine-tuned model with two 1-shot QA tasks, TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017) and web_questions (Berant et al., 2013). The results are illustrated in Figure 1, where we can see that when the accuracy on RTE dataset increases with fine-tuning, performance on few-shot QA tasks drops drastically. This phenomenon is general and not a result of specific fine-tuning or evaluation tasks (more results in Section 5.3). 3.2 F ORMAT SPECIALIZATION Why are the in-context learning abilities of an LLM so easily lost after a few hundred steps of fine-tuning? A natural hypothesis is that due to the homogeneity of output formats in fine-tuning datasets, the model quickly specializes to this task format and learns to follow it no matter what the input sequence is. This leads to the loss of in-context learning abilities on other tasks that do not share the same format. here by ‚Äúformat‚Äù we refer to the common characteristics of the sequences in fine-tuning task as a subset of all possible sequences, such as the language used, typical input/output lengths and styles, special tokens or punctuation, upper/lower case styles etc. For example, the output format of RTE is a set of two labels, ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù or ‚ÄúFalse‚Äù, among all possible sequences of tokens of various lengths. Since all data points share the same format in single-task fine-tuning, the model receives a strong gradient signal that the output should follow this format, thus its in-context learning performance on other tasks with different formats will drop, even when they share important semantic similarities with the fine-tuned task. To verify this hypothesis, we evaluate the RTE fine-tuned mT5 model on 1-shot TriviaQA task and count the percentage of outputs which are ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù or ‚ÄúFalse‚Äù. Figure 2 shows that as the fine-tuning proceeds, the model outputs more ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù or ‚ÄòFalse‚Äô even with a 1-shot prompted input from TriviaQA. In particular, after 300 fine-tuning steps, 90% of the output becomes ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù or ‚ÄúFalse‚Äù. The same phenomenon happens on other in-context learning tasks. With a 1-shot WMT16 En-De translation prompt, after 500 steps of RTE fine-tuning, more than 99% of the output becomes ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù or ‚ÄúFalse‚Äù. This indicates that format specialization is a possible reason for the loss of general in-context learning capabilities during fine-tuning. 3.3 F ORMAT LEARNING HAPPENS FIRST DURING STANDARD FINE -TUNING Next, we show experimental evidence that format learning happens first during standard fine-tuning. This is not surprising as the overwhelming majority of fine-tuning data points have very similar formats, causing a gradient signal that dominates over others, more nuanced elements such as the semantic content of the task. More concretely, for the RTE dataset, the ‚Äúformat‚Äù refers to the fact that the output ‚àà {True, False}, while the semantic content refers to the correlation between the input sequence and the output label. 4Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 Model: frozen Soft prompt tuning by  gradient descent Input Model tuning by  gradient descent Stage 1 Stage 2 Soft prompt: frozen Input Model: 2-stage finetuned Trained prompt Evaluation Input Input OR Figure 4: Overview of ProMoT, our two-stage fine-tuning strategy. We run prompt tuning at Stage 1 and model fine-tuning with the trained prompt at Stage 2. Green denotes trainable parameters and blue means frozen. We isolate format learning from semantic learning by creating a randomized RTE dataset where the output labels are randomly shuffled, thus are no longer correlated with the input sequences. The gradients of format learning, gformat, are then given by the gradients on the randomized RTE dataset. By comparing with the full gradient g on the original RTE we can detect when format learning happens during fine-tuning. We compute the gradients on the same batches of inputs for the two different settings. Figure 3 and Figure 7 in Appendix show that at the very beginning of fine-tuning (step 0), the full gradientg is highly aligned with the format-only gradientgformat, signified by cos(‚ü®g0, gformat,0‚ü©) ‚âà 1. Since randomized RTE and original RTE share the format information only and contain totally different semantic content, this alignment implies that the model is mostly learning the format. After 400 fine-tuning steps, this alignment disappears where the cosine similarity drops to around 0.21, when the True/False ratio reaches nearly 100%. 4 PROPOSED METHOD : PRO MPT TUNING WITH MODEL TUNING (PROMOT) MLP kernel Query Key Value Modules 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0cos( < gi, gformat, i > ) cos( < g0, gformat, 0 > ) cos( < g400, gformat, 400 > ) Figure 3: Format specialization happens at the beginning of fine-tuning: we show the cosine similarity between the full gra- dient g and the format gradient gformat on the MLP kernel, Query, Key and Value on the attention module. The g and gformat are much better aligned at the start of training, compared to at 400 steps. Comparison between more steps can be found in Figure 7 (Appendix). The observations from Section 3 inspire us to decouple format learning from fine-tuning, in order to alleviate spe- cialization to the fine-tuned task and preserve general in- context learning abilities. The key idea is to offload format learning to a separate small set of parameters during early fine-tuning, and allow the model‚Äôs own parameter changes afterwards to focus more on the semantic content of the task. We propose a two-stage fine-tuning strategy called ProMoT, illustrated in Figure 4. At the first stage, ProMoT uses prompt tuning to capture the format in a trainable soft prompt while the model itself is frozen. At the sec- ond stage, ProMoT freezes the learned soft prompt and fine-tunes the model itself to focus on semantic skills that might be more transferable. Stage 1: Prompt Tuning. Here we use a continu- ous trainable prompt (soft prompt) (Lester et al., 2021) prepended before the embedded inputs as the separate small set of tunable parameters. The soft prompt for a given fine-tuned task Pe ‚àà Rp√óe is a small set of free parameters taking the form of a few trainable embeddings, where p is the prompt length and e is the embedding size. Given an input sequence, prompt tuning first embeds it with the text embedding layer of the pretrained model, and then prepends it with the soft trainable prompt. The soft prompt is then optimized to reduce the loss while the pretrained model is frozen. As indicated in Section 3.3, fine-tuning first learns the format. We expect that by prompt tuning first, the soft prompt will learn the format. Although it is not guaranteed that 1We compute the format gradient at 400 steps, gformat,400, by first fine-tuning the model on RTE for 400 steps, then computing the gradient on the randomized RTE dataset with the same batch of input sequences. 5Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 the soft prompt only learns the format, the small capacity can prevent the soft prompt from learning all semantic skills in most realistic NLP tasks, as demonstrated by the performance gap between prompt tuning and standard fine-tuning. Stage 2: Fine-tuning with trained prompt. After prompt-tuning, we expect the trained prompt now storing most of the format information. We then freeze the soft prompt and fine-tune the pretrained model. Importantly, as shown in Figure 4, the soft prompt is still prepended before the input during this stage, forcing the model to learn things not captured already by the soft prompt. Other parameter-efficient and fine-tuning methods. ProMoT is a general framework that can be combined with different parameter-efficient tuning and fine-tuning techniques in respective stages. Conceptually, the prompt-tuning at the first stage can be replaced by other commonly used parameter- efficient methods such as LoRA Hu et al. (2021). However, empirically we found prompt-tuning is much better than LoRA on absorbing format information in early fine-tuning. More discussions can be found in Appendix C.7. For fine-tuning methods, we show examples to combine ProMoT with multi-task fine-tuning (Section 5.4) and 1-shot in-context learning prompt (Section 5.3, Section 5.4). Training with 1-shot prompt is introduced by Min et al. (2021) in a multi-task training setting. Evaluation. After the two-stage fine-tuning, we obtain a fine-tuned model checkpoint and a trained soft prompt for a specific fine-tuning target task. We expect the soft prompt stores most of the format information, and we only use this prompt during inference when the inference task has the same format as the fine-tuned target task. Otherwise, we remove the learned prompt and simply feed the original input into the fine-tuned model. 5 E XPERIMENTS 5.1 S ETTINGS Datasets. We use RTE (Wang et al., 2019; Bentivogli et al., 2009) and WMT14 En-Fr (Bojar et al., 2014) as two fine-tuning tasks in our main experiments. They are selected as examples of classification (RTE) and generative tasks (WMT14 En-Fr translation). Experiments on additional fine-tuning tasks including SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015) and OpenbookQA (Mihaylov et al., 2018) can be found in Appendix C. We use 8 tasks unseen during fine-tuning to evaluate the model‚Äôs generalization abilities. The 8 evaluation tasks are chosen to represent four types of tasks: ‚Ä¢ Natural language inference: CB (De Marneff et al., 2019) and WiC (Pilehvar & Camacho- Collados, 2018) from superGLUE (Wang et al., 2019) ‚Ä¢ Closed book QA: TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), web_questions (Berant et al., 2013) ‚Ä¢ Translation: WMT16 En-Ro, WMT16 En-De (Bojar et al., 2016) ‚Ä¢ Summarization: XSum (Narayan et al., 2018), WikiLingua (Ladhak et al., 2020) For each evaluation task, we use 1-shot and 4-shots prompts and task templates from PaLM (Chowd- hery et al., 2022) as described in the Appendix 7. Metrics. We report accuracy for classification tasks, exact match ratio for QA tasks, BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) for translation tasks and Rouge-2 score (Lin, 2004) for summarization tasks. We evaluate the model on development set for superGLUE sub-tasks (RTE, CB and WiC) and on test set for all other tasks. Besides per-task performance, we also report the normalized average (Norm. Avg.) performance on all evaluation tasks by averaging the performances normalized to [0,100], following the \"normalized preferred metric\" in BIG-bench (Srivastava et al., 2022) and Chung et al. (2022). Models. We primarily use mT5 (Xue et al., 2020) XXL model (Raffel et al., 2020b) in our main experiments, which is pretrained on multi-lingual corpus and contains 13B parameters. This is to accommodate multi-lingual scenarios among our training and evaluation tasks. To show the effectiveness of our method on different pretraining corpus, model sizes and architectures, we also include experiments on mT5 XL, T5.1.1 XXL and PaLM 8b in Appendix C. T5 based models 6Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 are shown to have meaningful few-shot performance as shown in Chung et al. (2022). We do not consider FLAN-T5 (Chung et al., 2022) as a base model in our experiments because it has already been fine-tuned on a large amount of supervised datasets, including our evaluation datasets. More experimental details can be found in Appendix B. Comparing methods. We compare our ProMoT with several different configurations, including ‚Ä¢ Pretrained model: We evaluate the pretrained model on all tasks without any fine-tuning. ‚Ä¢ Standard fine-tuning: Fine-tune the pretrained model without trainable prompts. We also include a multi-task version in Section 5.4 which is commonly used to boost model generalization on unseen tasks. ‚Ä¢ Prompt tuning: Tune the trainable prompt with pretrained model frozen. As the model is fixed, prompt tuning will not change the pretrained model‚Äôs performance on in-context learning tasks comparing when the prompt is removed. ‚Ä¢ Our proposed method: ProMoT: Our proposed two-stage fine-tuning strategy. ‚Ä¢ Our proposed method: ProMoT+1-shot: To further boost in-context learning performance, we prepend a 1-shot example to the input in Figure 4 during training. 5.2 S UPERVISED PERFORMANCE ON FINE -TUNING TASKS We first show that ProMoT training can achieve similar or even better performance on fine-tuning tasks compared to standard fine-tuning. We apply three different fine-tuning methods on four different tasks and report the result in Table 2. We report the best performance within the same number of fine-tuning steps (See Appendix B for more details). ProMoT outperforms standard fine-tuning on supervised performance on 3 out of 4 fine-tuning target tasks and outperforms prompt-tuning on 4 out of 4 tasks. Therefore the improved in-context learning performance on unseen tasks (better generalization ability), as will be demonstrated in the next few sections, comes without sacrificing the fine-tune task‚Äôs performance.

BLEU on the fine-tuned task is in the first row. We compare the Norm. Avg. (normalized average performance) with pretrained model and report the relative difference, where red denotes decreased performance and blue denotes increased performance. WMT16 En-De and En-Ro are translation tasks with different language pairs from WMT14 En-Fr. From both tables, we first observe that the model‚Äôs in-context learning performance drops significantly after standard fine-tuning. In particular, the few-shot learning performances drop to near zero for 6 over 8 tasks in Table 3, with the only exceptions being CB and WiC where they share the same format as the RTE fine-tuning task. On the contrary, ProMoT reduces the loss of the in-context learning performance on unseen few- shot evaluation tasks, and even boosts some evaluation tasks that are semantically related to the fine-tuning task but with totally different task formats, resulting in an increasing in-context learning performance on average. In Table 3, ProMoT on the binary NLI dataset dataset consistently improves few-shot performances on two summarization tasks beyond the pretrained model. In Table 4, ProMoT training on English-French translation substantially improves few-shot performance on other language translation pairs such as English to German and Romanian. This cross-task generalization across different task formats are infeasible with previous fine-tuning techniques. Text examples from standard fine-tuning and ProMoT can be found in Appendix C.9. The improvement with less specialization and more generalization can be further boosted when we combine ProMoT with 1-shot prompt to incorporate in-context learning objective during fine-tuning. It is however not surprising that even ProMoT cannot completely eliminate specialization and may still negatively influence some unseen in-context learning tasks compared to the pretrained model, depending on the characteristics of the fine-tuning task. In the next section, we show that a multi-task setup further improves the already strong generalization of ProMoT. 5.4 M ORE GENERALIZATION WITH MULTITASK TRAINING Multi-task training is commonly used to improve model‚Äôs generalization ability (Wei et al., 2021b; Chung et al., 2022). As a general fine-tuning framework, ProMoT can be combined with multi-tasking and achieves better generalization compared to standard multi-task fine-tuning. We apply multi-task ProMoT training on mixed RTE and WMT14 En-Fr translation dataset. At the prompt-tuning stage, we train a soft prompt for each task. At the fine-tuning stage, we mix different tasks and prepend the corresponding soft task prompt to each training example. We keep other configurations the same as Section 5.3 and report the results in Table 5. We compare multi-task ProMoT with standard multi-task fine-tuning. The results show that Multi-task ProMoT significantly outperforms standard multi-task fine-tuning on enhancing generalization with larger improvement on average on unseen 1-shot evaluation tasks. Similar to the single task setting, adding 1-shot prompt before each training input in the fine-tuning stage further boosts the performance of both multi-task fine-tuning and multi-task ProMoT. 8Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 Pretrainedmulti-task FTMulti ProMoTmulti-task FTMulti-ProMoT+ 1-shot + 1-shot Multi-task RTE 47.65 90.25 91.34 91.70 93.14Fine-tuningWMT14 En-Fr1.982 41.34 40.73 40.87 40.55 Norm.

First, instead of fine-tuning in a two-stage process, we consider ‚Äújointly fine-tuning‚Äù both the soft prompt and the model parameters in one stage. As shown in Table 6, this method still results in specialization and severe loss of in-context learning abilities. Thus the benefit of ProMoT comes from its two-stage nature instead of merely adding more learnable parameters (soft prompt). In addition, fine-tuning the models with a fixed random soft prompt does not help - as it does not help to remove format specialization. Another important baseline is to fine-tune the model with natural language prompts in place instead of soft prompts, which also capture the format to some extend. In a 1-shot scenario, this approach is still far worse compared to ProMoT, showing that learned soft prompts work better than natural language prompts in reducing format specialization in fine-tuning. 6 C ONCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS In this paper, we identify format specialization as one important cause of the loss of general in-context learning abilities during LLM fine-tuning, which tends to happen at the beginning of fine-tuning. We are motivated to develop ProMoT, a simple yet effective two-stage fine-tuning framework that utilizes soft trainable prompts to absorb task-specific formats before model fine-tuning. Experiments on a diverse set of NLP tasks show that ProMoT reduces format specialization and results in surprising generalization across very different tasks, making it a promising method to build general-purpose capabilities into LLMs with small fine-tuning datasets. Although we have shown the effectiveness of ProMoT in our main paper, there is no theoretical guarantee on how much format specialization can be absorbed by the soft prompt during the first stage of ProMoT. Besides, our experiments are done with models smaller than 15B due to limited computation resources. It can be interesting to test ProMoT on larger models. 9Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank the reviewers for their invaluable feedbacks.

Differentiable prompt makes pre-trained language models better few-shot learners. arXiv preprint arXiv:2108.13161, 2021. 13Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 A B ROADER IMPACTS In our work, we propose a method to improve general-purpose language models with fine-tuning datasets. The improved general-purpose language model may be used in malicious applications such as generating disinformation. To mitigate the potential negative impacts, we can add watermark or deploy AI-generated text classifiers before releasing the model. B E XPERIMENT DETAILS B.1 I NPUT TEMPLATE USED IN EXPERIMENTS In Table 7, we list the natural language input template used in our experiments for each task The Task Template RTE [premise] question: [hypothesis] Is it true or false? answer: {True, False} CB & SNLI [premise] question: [hypothesis] Is it true or false or neither? answer: {True, False, Neither} WiC [sentence1] [sentence2] question: The word [word] is used in the same way in the two sentences. Is it true or False? answer: {True, False} OpenbookQA Q: [question] A) [option A] B) [option B] C) [option C] D) [option D] A: QA Q: [question] A: Translation Translate [source language] to [target language]: [sentence 1] Summarization Article: [article] One sentence summary: Table 7: Input template for each task example shown in Table 1 is from ID 41141109 in XSum dataset. B.2 O UTPUT POST-PROCESSING For each task, we first extract the text after <extra_id_0> and before <extra_id_1>, then trim the text by locating and remove the text after the second prefix token (Q:, Translate, Article:). For classification tasks including RTE, CB and WiC, we check whether the first output token is True or False. B.3 D ATASET AND MODELS We list the statistics of all datasets used in the paper in Table 8. All the datasets and models can be used in research context. B.4 H YPER -PARAMETERS For all mT5 models, we fine-tune with learning rate 0.001, drop rate 0.1 and label smoothing 0.1, following the default settings for T5 models (Raffel et al., 2020b). For all prompt tuning experiments, we use learning rate 0.2 and prompt length 100. For all tasks except summarization tasks, we choose the model input sequence length larger than the input length in datasets.

We use Adafactor optimizer and batch size 64 without data-packing across all experiments. In inference, we use beam search to decode the outputs with width 4. More experimental settings are provided in the appendix. For ProMoT tuning, at stage 1 we run prompt tuning for 5000 steps and save a checkpoint every 1000 steps, then select the prompt checkpoint with the best performance on target task. At stage 2, we freeze the trained prompt and fine-tune the model for 1000 steps, checkpointing every 100 steps. We pick the model checkpoint with highest performance on the fine-tuned task as our final checkpoint. For comparison, we run prompt tuning and standard fine-tuning for 5000 and 1000 training steps respectively and report the performance of the best checkpoint. We explore fine-tuning with more steps in Appendix C.3. In ablation study in Section 5.5, we include an experiment to jointly fine-tune soft prompt and pretrained model. In this experiment, we finetune the model and prompt for 1000 steps with the same learning rate 0.001, following the setting in (He et al., 2022). B.5 H ARDWARE AND IMPLEMENTATION All the experiments are implemented based on the original prompt tuning2 and T5x code base3. All experiments are run on a cluster of 64 parallel TPUs. Time cost for different experiments varies, however, all training experiments can be finished within 1 day. C A DDITIONAL EXPERIMENT RESULTS C.1 A DDITIONAL RESULTS ON SINGLE TASK FINE -TUNING As complementary results of Table 3 and 4, we list and compare the performance of prompt tuning + 1-shot in Table 9. We also provide experiments on SNLI and OpenbookQA datasets in Table 10. Without fine-tuning, pretrained mT5 failed to output ‚ÄúA‚Äù, ‚ÄúB‚Äù, ‚ÄúC‚Äù, ‚ÄúD‚Äù for multi-choice QA in 0-shot openbookQA dataset, which results in a zero accuracy. We can see that the additional experiments are consistent with our main experiments that ProMoT can achieve similar supervised performance on fine-tuning tasks with less forgetting and even better performance on general in-context learning tasks.

C.3 T RAINING MORE STEPS : TRADE -OFF BETWEEN FINE -TUNING TARGET TASK AND IN-CONTEXT LEARNING ABILITIES In Section 5.3, we report the results of the best checkpoints within 1000 steps of fine-tuning. With a longer training period, we can see a more clear trade-off between the performance on fine-tuning target task and the performance on in-context learning abilities. Here we show the long-term trade-off between fine-tuning target task and in-context learning evaluation tasks by scattering the performance of different checkpoints within 20000 steps fine-tuning. In Figure 5, and 6, we plot the trade-off on classification and translation tasks, respectively. 41 42 43 44 BLEU Score 10 20 30 40 50Avg.

C.9 Q UALITATIVE RESULTS ON FINE -TUNING WMT14 E N-FR TASK In Table 1 we show an example from fine-tuning task RTE. Here we show examples for fine-tuning task WMT14 En-Fr translation on different unseen few-shot tasks. We compare the outputs from ground-truth targets, pretrained mT5, fine-tuned mT5 on WMT14 En-Fr and ProMoT mT5 on WMT14 En-Fr. The outputs are generated with a 1-shot example. As we can see from the examples, standard fine-tuning on WMT14 En-Fr will 1) make the model overfit its format and tend to output French; and 2) model tends to repeat its input which is similar to translation task. ProMoT alleviates this specialization on fine-tuning task and has better generalization. ‚Ä¢ WMT16 En-De ‚Äì Target: Danach war der Mann, der sich nach Angaben seines Anwalts mittlerweile wieder auf freiem Fu√übefindet, in eine gr√∂√üere Zelle verlegt worden. ‚Äì Pretrained: Danach wurde der Mann in eine gr√∂√üere. ‚Äì Fine-tune: L‚Äôhomme, qui, selon une d√©claration de son avocat, a depuis √©t√© lib√©r√©, a ensuite √©t√© transf√©r√© dans une cellule plus grande. ‚Äì ProMoT: Danach wurde der Mann, der mittlerweile freigelassen wurde, in eine gr√∂√üere Zelle verlegt. ‚Ä¢ WebQuestions ‚Äì Target: Milwaukee ‚Äì Pretrained: Milwaukee, Wisconsin ‚Äì Fine-tune: Where is harley davidson corporate headquarters?

Introduction Scaling pre-trained language models (PTMs) has shown increasing power on a wide range of NLP tasks (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020; 2021b; Zeng et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2021; Qiu et al., 2020). Extremely large PTMs can easily generalize to various downstream tasks with a few labeled samples (Brown et al., 2020). However, making these large PTMs beneÔ¨Åt everyone is a challenge. On the one hand, running such models can be very expensive or even infeasible for most users. On the other hand, the model parameters are often not open-sourced due to commercial 1Fudan University 2East China Normal University 3Peng Cheng Laboratory.

Users Query  Response Server Mixed-Task Batch PTM Inference (Black-Box)  Task Prompt (Tunable) Samples Update Prompt Figure 1.Illustration of Language-Model-as-a-Service (LMaaS). Users can query the PTM deployed on the server through a black- box API. In each query, users can input a task prompt and a batch of texts. On the server side, the samples can be mixed in a large batch to be fed into the PTM. By iteratively querying the PTM through the black-box API, users can optimize and Ô¨Ånally obtain good prompts to solve the language tasks of interest. considerations and the potential risk of misuse.1 Therefore, large PTMs such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), ERNIE 3.0 (Sun et al., 2021) and Yuan 1.0 (Wu et al., 2021) are usually released as a service, allowing users to access these powerful models through black-box APIs. In this scenario, called Language-Model-as-a-Service (LMaaS), users can solve the language tasks of interest using the black-box APIs by crafting task-speciÔ¨Åc text prompts or including training samples in the input texts (a.k.a. in- context learning (Brown et al., 2020)). Due to the great power of the general-purpose PTMs underlying the APIs, such approaches can achieve considerable performance on simple language tasks, and therefore have powered many interesting applications2. However, querying large PTMs through hand-crafted text prompts cannot fully exploit la- beled data, resulting in unsatisfactory performance in many use cases. Instead of designing discrete text prompts, recently much effort has been devoted to continuous prompt tuning (Li & Liang, 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2021; Liu et al., 1https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/ 2See https://gpt3demo.com/ for examples. arXiv:2201.03514v4  [cs.CL]  27 Jun 2022Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service 2021b), which is to optimize the continuous prompt injected to the text while keeping the PTM parameters frozen. Such methods only require storing a small continuous prompt for each task, and therefore are highly deployment-efÔ¨Åcient. Besides, tuning the continuous prompt can be as effective as Ô¨Åne-tuning the entire model when the PTM becomes large (Lester et al., 2021). However, in all the previous methods, the continuous prompts are learned through back- propagation, which is unavailable in the scenario of LMaaS. Can we optimize the task-speciÔ¨Åc continuous prompts when we only have access to the PTM inference API? Since gradients are unavailable, we can only invoke derivative-free optimization (DFO) 3 (Kolda et al., 2003; Conn et al., 2009; Rios & Sahinidis, 2013). DFO involves a kind of optimization algorithms that do not depend on gra- dients, but only relies on function values (or Ô¨Åtness values) of sampled solutions. However, DFO algorithms are known to suffer from slow convergence rate when the dimension- ality of the search space is high. Thus, it is intractable to optimize even only the continuous prompts, which can be tens of thousands of parameters, using DFO algorithms. Fortunately, recent work found that common PTMs, despite their large numbers of parameters, have a very low intrinsic dimensionality (Aghajanyan et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2021). That means, there exists a low-dimensional reparameteriza- tion that is as effective for Ô¨Åne-tuning as the full parameter space. It has been demonstrated that optimizing only hun- dreds (Aghajanyan et al., 2021) or even dozens (Qin et al., 2021) of parameters can achieve non-trivial performance. Given that the intrinsic dimensionality of the objective func- tion (in our case is the forward computation of PTMs) is low, the optimization can be effectively solved via DFO al- gorithms with random embedding (Wang et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2016; Letham et al., 2020). Based on the these insights, this paper proposes the Black- Box Tuning (BBT) to solve various language understand- ing tasks by only accessing the PTM inference API. In particular, we manage to optimize the continuous prompt prepended to the input text by iteratively querying the PTM inference API, as brieÔ¨Çy depicted in Figure 1. To han- dle the high dimensionality of the continuous prompt, we project the original prompt space using a random linear projection onto a much smaller subspace and solve this optimization problem with some derivative-free optimizer in that smaller subsapce. In contrast to conventional Ô¨Åne- tuning methods that can only be performed by the service side, black-box tuning allows users to optimize their task- speciÔ¨Åc prompts locally on resource-limited devices (even without GPUs). Our experimental results demonstrate that prompting RoBERTaLARGE (Liu et al., 2019) using BBT on 3Also termed as black-box, zeroth-order or gradient-free opti- mization. a few labeled samples not only outperforms manual prompt and in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020), but also out- performs its gradient-based counterparts, namely prompt tuning (Lester et al., 2021) and full model tuning. The contribution of this paper is three folds:4 ‚Ä¢ This paper proposes a novel scenario (LMaaS) where one should learn to prompt the PTMs by only accessing their inference APIs. ‚Ä¢ This paper offers a solution (BBT) for such a scenario to accomplish common language understanding tasks without access to model parameters and gradients, such that large-scale PTMs can better beneÔ¨Åt users. ‚Ä¢ Empirical results show that DFO can successfully deal with real-world language tasks by learning to prompt large-scale PTMs with more than millions of parame- ters. Thus, this work pioneers the work of optimizing large-scale PTMs through DFO methods. 2. Background Large-Scale PTMs as APIs. It is a promising way to de- ploy large-scale PTMs to serve downstream applications by providing general-purpose APIs. For the service side, wrapping the computation of the PTM into an easy-to-use API has become a common practice (Brown et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2021). In contrast to training, the in- ference speed of large-scale PTMs can be highly optimized with acceleration techniques such as ORT and TensorRT. In addition, large-scale PTMs are often not open-sourced due to the commercial reasons and the potential risk of mis- use. For the user side , even if the large-scale PTMs are available, it is expensive or even infeasible to locally run them. Thus, how to exploit the PTM inference API to solve conventional language tasks is a promising direction. Intrinsic Dimensionality of PTMs. The intrinsic dimen- sionality of an objective function is the minimum number of parameters needed to obtain satisfactory solutions (Li et al., 2018). In particular, the intrinsic dimensionality in- dicates the lowest dimensional reparameterization that is as effective for optimizing as the full parameter space. Li et al. (2018) propose to measure the intrinsic dimensionality of neural networks by Ô¨Ånding the minimal dimensionality of the subspace that is randomly projected from the full trainable parameters, in which they can optimize the neural networks to achieve satisfactory solutions. Aghajanyan et al. (2021) empirically show that large-scale pre-training implic- itly compresses the intrinsic dimensionality of downstream NLP tasks. By tuning only hundreds of parameters that 4Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ txsun1997/Black-Box-TuningBlack-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service are then randomly projected onto the full parameter space of RoBERTa, they can achieve 90% performance relative to full model tuning. Qin et al. (2021) show that intrinsic subspace on various tasks can be compressed to less than 100 dimensions with multi-task supervision. This line of research, along with the work of parameter-efÔ¨Åcient tun- ing (Houlsby et al., 2019; Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2021a; He et al., 2021), demonstrate that PTMs can well adapt to downstream tasks by tuning a very small proportion of parameters, which im- plies the possibility of optimizing large-scale PTMs with derivative-free algorithms. Prompt-Based Learning. Prompt-based learning is to formulate downstream tasks as a (masked) language mod- eling task, and therefore reduces the gap between PTM pre-training and Ô¨Åne-tuning (Brown et al., 2020; Schick & Sch¬®utze, 2021a;b; Gao et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2022). For instance, one can use BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) to predict whether the sentence ‚ÄùThis is a fantastic movie‚Äù is positive or negative by appending the prompt ‚ÄùIt was [MASK]‚Äù and see if BERT predicts ‚Äùgreat‚Äù or ‚Äùterrible‚Äù at the masked position. Note that the prompt is not necessarily discrete, it can also be optimized efÔ¨Åciently in continuous space with gradient descent (Li & Liang, 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2021; Qin & Eisner, 2021; Liu et al., 2021b; Zhong et al., 2021). In the case of only tuning the continuous prompt while keeping the parameters of large PTMs untouched, one can retain the efÔ¨Åcient serving beneÔ¨Åts while matching the performance of full model tuning (Lester et al., 2021). Our work also proposes to optimize the continuous prompt while keeping the PTM parameters unchanged, but without gradient descent. Derivative-Free Optimization. Derivative-free optimiza- tion (DFO) realizes optimization only via the function val- ues f(x) on the sampled solutions x. Most DFO algorithms share a common structure of sampling-and-updating to en- hance the quality of solutions. Representative DFO algo- rithms include evolutionary algorithms (Hansen et al., 2003), Bayesian optimization (Shahriari et al., 2016), etc. Due to their ability of addressing complex optimization tasks, DFO algorithms have achieved many impressive applica- tions in automatic machine learning (Snoek et al., 2012), reinforcement learning (Salimans et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2017), objective detection (Zhang et al., 2015b), etc. 3. Approach 3.1. Problem Formulation Common language understanding tasks can be formulated as a classiÔ¨Åcation task, which is to predict for a batch of input texts X the labels Y. To solve the target language understanding task with a general-purpose PTM, we should modify X with some template (e.g., adding some trigger words and a special token [MASK] for BERT-like PTMs) and map the labels Y to some words in the PTM vocab- ulary (e.g., the sentiment label ‚Äùpositive‚Äù can be mapped to ‚Äùgreat‚Äù). The modiÔ¨Åed inputs and labels are denoted as ÀúX and ÀúY. Assume the BERT-like PTM inference API f takes a continuous prompt p and a batch of modiÔ¨Åed texts ÀúX as input, and outputs the logits on the masked positions, i.e., ÀÜY = f(p; ÀúX). With the output logits, we can calculate the loss on this batch of data, which is not necessarily to be differentiable. Our goal is to Ô¨Ånd the optimal prompt p‚ãÜ = arg minp‚ààPL(f(p; ÀúX),ÀúY), where Pis some search space of interest and Lis some loss function such as nega- tive accuracy. The black-box function f is not available to the optimizer in closed form, but can be evaluated at a query point (p; ÀúX). 3.2. Black-Box Tuning As demonstrated by Lester et al. (2021), dozens of prompt to- kens are required to obtain a competitive performance when only tuning continuous prompts. Given that the embedding dimensionality of large-scale PTMs is usually larger than one thousand (e.g., the word embeddings of RoBERTaLARGE are 1024-dimensional), the dimensionality of the continuous prompt p ‚ààRD that we are interested to optimize can be tens of thousands, which makes derivative-free optimization intractable. To handle this high-dimensional optimization, since large-scale PTMs have a low intrinsic dimensional- ity (Aghajanyan et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2021), we manage to optimize z ‚ààRd in a much smaller subspace (d‚â™D), and use a random projection matrix A ‚ààRD√ód to project z on the original prompt space P. Note that directly projecting z onto the prompt space that is compatible with the PTM is non-trivial. To ease the optimization, we instead optimize the increment of some initial prompt p0. For simplicity, we randomly sample n tokens from the PTM vocabulary as initialization. Thus, our objective becomes z‚ãÜ = arg min z‚ààZ L(f(Az + p0; ÀúX),ÀúY) , (1) where Zis the search space. Previous work (Wang et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2016; Letham et al., 2020) in derivative- free optimization usually sets each entry in the random matrix A by sampling from some normal distribution. How- ever, this sampling strategy does not perform well in our scenario. Instead, we set values of the random matrix A by sampling from a uniform distribution adopted in He et al. (2015) (cf. Appendix A for the comparison). We restrict the search space to Z= [‚àí5,5]d. For the loss functionL, a straightforward alternative is using negative accuracy. However, the reward of accuracy can beBlack-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service Best film ever . It was <MASK> . A totally boring movie ! It was <MASK> . You 'll probably love it .

Given z ‚ààRd provided by the derivative-free optimizer, we project it to the prompt space by a random matrix A ‚ààRD√ód. By adding the projected prompt embeddings Az with some initial prompt embeddings p0 (in this illustration are the embeddings of tokens randomly sampled from the PTM‚Äôs vocabulary), we obtain the Ô¨Ånal prompt embeddings that are then concatenated with the input texts ÀúX. By calling the black-box API f, which implements the forward computation of the PTM, the predictions on the masked positions are obtained, i.e., ÀÜY = f(p; ÀúX). With the prediction ÀÜY and the golden labels ÀúY at hand, we can calculate the loss that is used by the derivative-free optimizer to suggest a new z. sparse and less informative, especially when training data is limited. Thus, we also consider two loss functions that are more sensitive to predictions, i.e., cross entropy and hinge loss. Given the output logits ÀÜ yover a candidate set of label words, and the golden label word Àúyof a certain sample, the cross entropy is deÔ¨Åned as LCE(ÀÜ y,Àúy) =‚àílog SoftmaxÀúy(ÀÜ y). (2) For hinge loss, we adopt a multi-class extension (Weston & Watkins, 1999), LHinge(ÀÜ y,Àúy) = ‚àë iÃ∏=Àúy max(0,Œ≥ + ÀÜ yi ‚àíÀÜ yÀúy). (3) In this work we set the margin Œ≥ = 2. The performances of using cross entropy, hinge loss, and negative accuracy are compared in Figure 3. 3.3. The CMA Evolution Strategy As demonstrated in Aghajanyan et al. (2021), the intrinsic dimensionality of PTMs like RoBERTa LARGE on various tasks can be hundreds. To handle optimization of such scale, we adopt the CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evo- lution Strategy) (Hansen & Ostermeier, 2001; Hansen et al., 2003), which is a widely used evolutionary algorithm for non-convex black-box optimization in continuous domain. In particular, CMA-ES maintains a parameterized search distribution model, i.e., multivariate normal distribution. In each iteration, CMA-ES samples a population of new query solutions (also referred to as individuals or offspring) from the multivariate normal distribution model z(t+1) i ‚àºm(t) + œÉ(t)N(0,C(t)) , (4) where i= 1,...,Œª and Œªis the population size. m(t) ‚ààRd is the mean vector of the search distribution at iteration step t, œÉ(t) ‚ààR+ is the overall standard deviation that controls the step length, and C(t) ‚ààRd√ód is the covariance matrix that determines the shape of the distribution ellipsoid. By maximizing the likelihood of successful steps, m(t), œÉ(t), C(t) are updated (cf. Hansen (2016) for more details). 3.4. Pre-Training Prompt Embedding Considering that sentence-pair tasks can share the same template and label words, as shown in Table 1, we can pre- train a prompt embedding p0 on some publicly available NLI task (in our experiments we use the MNLI (Williams et al., 2018) training set) for a better initialization. For other classiÔ¨Åcation tasks we set p0 as word embeddings randomly drawn from the vocabulary of RoBERTaLARGE. 4. Experiments 4.1. Setup Dataset.

For a broad range of users, the amount of labeled data can be limited, in which case they can resort to the deployed large PTMs due to their great power of few- shot learning (Brown et al., 2020). Hence, in this paper we conduct experiments in the few-shot setting. We randomly select ksamples for each class to construct a k-shot training set Dtrain, and compose a development set Ddev by randomly drawing another ksamples from the original training set and ensure that |Dtrain|= |Ddev|to simulate the true few-shot learning setting (Perez et al., 2021). Following Zhang et al. (2021a), Gao et al. (2021), and Gu et al. (2021), we use the original development sets as the test sets. For datasets with- out development sets, we use the original test sets. Hence, in our experiments |Dtest|‚â´|D train|= |Ddev|. Backbone Model. We choose RoBERTaLARGE (Liu et al., 2019) as our backbone model because: (1) We mainly fo- cus on language understanding tasks; (2) Aghajanyan et al. (2021) have demonstrated that RoBERTaLARGE has a very small intrinsic dimensionality (about hundreds) on many tasks. It is worth noting that generative PTMs such as GPT (Brown et al., 2020), T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) and BART (Lewis et al., 2020) are also compatible with our framework if we convert downstream tasks into a uniÔ¨Åed text-to-text format. We leave for future work the applica- tions of generative PTMs. Baselines. We compare our proposed black-box tuning with two kinds of methods: gradient-based methods and gradient-free methods. For gradient-based methods, we consider three baselines: (1) Prompt Tuning: Following Lester et al. (2021), we only train the continuous prompts Table 2.Default conÔ¨Åguration of hyper-parameters. Hyper-parameter Default Prompt length (L) 50 Subspace dimension (d) 500 Population size (Œª) 20 Random projection (A) Uniform Loss functionL Cross Entropy Budget (# of API calls) 8000 prepended to the input texts while keeping the PTM frozen. We use an Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015) with learn- ing rate of 5e-4 and batch size of 16 for 1000 epochs. For fair comparison, we use the same prompt length, manual template, label words, and the same pre-trained prompt em- bedding for initialization on sentence-pair tasks as black-box tuning. (2) P-Tuning v2 (Liu et al., 2021a) is an improved variant of prompt tuning. Instead of injecting continuous prompts merely into the input layer, P-Tuning v2 prepends and optimizes continuous prompts at every layer of the PTM. We optimize the prompts of length 128 at each layer using an Adam optimizer with learning rate of 5e-4 and batch size of 32 for 2000 epochs. (3) Model Tuning: We Ô¨Åne-tune the entire PTM on each task using an Adam optimizer with learning rate of 1e-5 and batch size of 16 for 200 epochs. For gradient-free methods, we consider three baselines: (1) Manual Prompt: We directly use the templates and label words in Table 1 to conduct zero-shot evaluation. The re- sults of manual prompt can be seen as initial points of our method. (2) In-context Learning: Following Brown et al. (2020), we randomly select up to 32 training samples and concatenate them with the input texts. (3) Feature-based Methods: Feature-based methods (Peters et al., 2019) is also a competitive baseline for LMaaS, where one can re- quest the features encoded by the large PTM and locally train a classiÔ¨Åer to accomplish the task of interest. Here we consider two implementations: (a) Feature-MLP: We train a two-layered MLP classiÔ¨Åer on the [CLS] representation of the PTM. (b) Feature-BiLSTM: We train a bidirectional LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) on the repre- sentations of the sequence of tokens, followed by a linear classiÔ¨Åer on the top. For both implementations of feature-Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service based methods, we use an Adam optimizer with learning rate of 3e-4 and batch size of 16 to train the attached clas- siÔ¨Åers for 1000 epochs. For black-box tuning, we give in Table 2 the default conÔ¨Åguration of hyper-parameters used in our experiments. The effect of each hyper-parameter is explored in ¬ß 4.3. 4.2. Results Overall Comparison. We Ô¨Årst demonstrate the experi- mental results of black-box tuning and the baselines across 7 datasets in Table 3. The proposed black-box tuning sig- niÔ¨Åcantly outperforms the other four gradient-free methods. We observe that in-context learning performs even worse than manual prompt on some tasks, and suffers from high variance. That means, in-context learning cannot effectively utilize labeled samples included in the context. Feature- based methods perform slightly better than manual prompt and in-context learning. Meanwhile, Feature-BiLSTM out- performs Feature-MLP due to its advantage of using more informative features. Surprisingly, black-box tuning also outperforms its gradient-based counterparts, namely prompt tuning, p-tuning v2, and model tuning, on average perfor- mance of the 7 tasks. Note that the only difference between prompt tuning and black-box tuning is whether we use gra- dient descent (i.e., Adam optimizer) or DFO algorithm (i.e., CMA-ES). Based on the experimental results, we suspect that gradient-based optimization tends to overÔ¨Åt the small training data while DFO tends to Ô¨Ånd better solutions due to its exploration mechanism. In addition, we Ô¨Ånd that model tuning performs much better than prompt tuning and black- box tuning when number of classes is large (e.g., DBPedia). On NLI tasks (i.e., SNLI and RTE), when using pre-trained prompt embedding (¬ß 3.4), prompt tuning and black-box tuning signiÔ¨Åcantly outperform model tuning, which also conÔ¨Årms the effectiveness of prompt pre-training (Gu et al., 2021) in the context of black-box tuning. Detailed Comparison. In the scenario of LMaaS, there are many other factors to be considered. In Table 4 we com- pare black-box tuning and the baseline methods in terms of deployment efÔ¨Åciency, viability of as-a-service, training time, memory usage on the user side and the server side, and the amount of data to be uploaded and downloaded. Model tuning is not deployment-efÔ¨Åcient because it needs to main- tain a copy of the entire model for each user. Gradient-based methods cannot make the PTM serve as a service due to the requirement of gradients. Feature-based methods and black-box tuning are suitable for LMaaS. However, feature- based methods cannot achieve competitive results when labeled data is limited. Therefore, among all the considered methods, only black-box tuning can achieve satisfactory performance while maintaining reasonable training time, memory footprint, and network load. Unlike gradient-based methods, in which the optimization cost is proportional to the size of the PTM, the optimization cost of black-box tuning is decoupled from the scale of the PTM, and only relies on the subspace dimensionality. For fair compari- son of training time, we perform early stopping for all the compared methods, i.e., we stop learning if the development accuracy does not increase after 1000 steps. All the methods are implemented with PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019) and ex- perimented on a single NVIDIA GTX 3090 GPU. Note that the process of model inference can be further accelerated via better implementations (e.g., using ONNX and TensorRT). In Table 4 we also report the training time of black-box tuning using ONNX Runtime. Detailed calculation of the amount of data to be uploaded/downloaded can be found in Appendix C. 4.3. Ablation Study In this section, we conduct ablation experiments on various hyper-parameters. To control experimental variables, we explore the effect of each hyper-parameter while keeping the other hyper-parameters as default as listed in Table 2. To stablize the experimental results and reduce the variance over different runs, we conduct ablation experiments in 64- shot setting. Each run is performed on the same data split with different random seeds. Experimental results of abla- tions on loss functions L, subspace dimensionality d, and prompt length Lare demonstrated in Figure 3. Additional ablation studies on the effect of the random projection A, the effect of the population size Œª, and the ablations in the 16-shot setting are in Appendix A. For each ablation, we show results under different budget, which is measured by the number of PTM inference API calls. In each API call, one can provide a continuous prompt p and query the results of the PTM forward computation on a batch of training data. In our few-shot setting, we can put all the training data into one batch, and therefore the objective function to be optimized is deterministic instead of stochastic. CMA-ES vs. Adam. We compare our used derivative- free optimizer, CMA-ES, with a competitive Ô¨Årst-order opti- mizer, Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015). For fair comparison, we update the continuous prompt using Adam with the gra- dients over the entire training data (i.e., batch size equals to |Dtrain|). We use learning rate of 1e-3 for Adam opti- mizer. As shown in the top row of Figure 3, Adam optimizer achieves faster convergence on both SST-2 and AG‚Äôs News due to the gradients it used. On the development sets, Adam performs slight worse than CMA-ES with cross entropy on SST-2 but better on AG‚Äôs News. But as demonstrated in Ta- ble 3, using Adam optimizer performs worse than CMA-ES on the average performance across seven task test sets.Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service Table 3.Overall comparison on various language understanding tasks. We report mean and standard deviation of performance over 3 different splits (¬ß 4.1). All of the results are obtained with pre-trained RoBERTaLARGE in 16-shot (per class) setting.

We consider three loss functions: cross entropy, hinge loss, and negative accuracy. As depicted in the top row of Figure 3, cross entropy and hinge loss signif- icantly outperform the negative accuracy. In the few-shot setting, the accuracy as a reward can be sparse, and cannot provide informative directions for optimization. On SST- 2 and AG‚Äôs News, we obtain that cross entropy performs slightly better than hinge loss. Subspace Dimensionality. The subspace of dimensional- ity dis the space where the optimization actually performs. According to the intrinsic dimensionality found in Agha- janyan et al. (2021), we explore the subspace dimensionality of {100, 200, 500, 1000}within the budget of {2k, 4k, 6k, 8k}. Accordingly, we set population size Œª= 4 + 3 log(d). As shown in the middle row of Figure 3, the best subspace dimensionality can be different on different tasks (d= 200 performs the best on SST-2 development set and d= 500 performs the best on AG‚Äôs News development set), which is related to the observation that intrinsic dimensionality varies across different tasks (Aghajanyan et al., 2021). In general, a small subspace (e.g., d= 100) is hard to cover a good solution, while a large subspace (e.g., d= 1000) may lead to poor generalization. Prompt Length. Prompt length L determines the di- mensionality of the original parameter space (in our case D= L√ó1024). We evaluate black-box tuning under each budget in {2k, 4k, 6k, 8k}while varying the prompt length in {10, 20, 50, 100}. As shown in the bottom row of Fig- ure 3, shorter prompt confers faster convergence on the training sets but does not yield better generalization on the development sets. L = 50achieves the best accuracy on both SST-2 and AG‚Äôs News development sets.Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Iterations over entire training data (| train|=128) 82.5 85.0 87.5 90.0 92.5 95.0 97.5 100.0Train accuracy (current best) SST-2 (train) Adam (cross entropy) CMA-ES (cross entropy) CMA-ES (hinge loss) CMA-ES (-accuracy) 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Iterations over entire training data (| train|=128) 77.5 80.0 82.5 85.0 87.5 90.0 92.5 95.0Dev accuracy (current best) SST-2 (dev) Adam (cross entropy) CMA-ES (cross entropy) CMA-ES (hinge loss) CMA-ES (-accuracy) 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Iterations over entire training data (| train|=128) 75 80 85 90 95 100Train accuracy (current best) AG's News (train) Adam (cross entropy) CMA-ES (cross entropy) CMA-ES (hinge loss) CMA-ES (-accuracy) 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Iterations over entire training data (| train|=128) 78 80 82 84 86 88 90Dev accuracy (current best) AG's News (dev) Adam (cross entropy) CMA-ES (cross entropy) CMA-ES (hinge loss) CMA-ES (-accuracy) 2000 4000 6000 8000 Budget (number of API calls) 94 95 96 97 98 99 100Train accuracy (current best) SST-2 (train) d = 1000 d = 500 d = 200 d = 100 2000 4000 6000 8000 Budget (number of API calls) 89 90 91 92 93 94Dev accuracy (current best) SST-2 (dev) d = 1000 d = 500 d = 200 d = 100 2000 4000 6000 8000 Budget (number of API calls) 84 86 88 90 92Train accuracy (current best) AG's News (train) d = 1000 d = 500 d = 200 d = 100 2000 4000 6000 8000 Budget (number of API calls) 83 84 85 86 87 88Dev accuracy (current best) AG's News (dev) d = 1000 d = 500 d = 200 d = 100 2000 4000 6000 8000 Budget (number of API calls) 95 96 97 98 99 100Train accuracy (current best) SST-2 (train) L = 10 L = 20 L = 50 L = 100 2000 4000 6000 8000 Budget (number of API calls) 88 89 90 91 92 93 94Dev accuracy (current best) SST-2 (dev) L = 10 L = 20 L = 50 L = 100 2000 4000 6000 8000 Budget (number of API calls) 82 84 86 88 90 92 94Train accuracy (current best) AG's News (train) L = 10 L = 20 L = 50 L = 100 2000 4000 6000 8000 Budget (number of API calls) 83 84 85 86 87 88Dev accuracy (current best) AG's News (dev) L = 10 L = 20 L = 50 L = 100 Figure 3.Ablations of loss function, subspace dimensionality, and prompt length.

Discussion and Future Work In this section we discuss our proposed method in the con- text of (1) derivative-free optimization and (2) prompt-based learning, respectively. By drawing comparisons with these two lines of research, we highlight some directions that could improve this work in future. Comparison with Previous Derivative-Free Approaches. Our proposed method lies in the same framework of previ- ous work that solves high-dimensional derivative-free op- timization problems via random embedding (Wang et al., 2016). In contrast, we set the random embedding A by sampling from a uniform distribution instead of normal dis- tributions, and use the CMA-ES to perform optimization in the generated subspace. In previous work, the target black- box functions are usually synthetic functions where only a few dimensions can affect the function values, and therefore most of the dimensions are strictly non-effective. In our real- world scenario, the intrinsic dimension can be approximate. In the context of PTMs, a more appropriate substitution for the term intrinsic dimensionality can be œµ-effective dimen- sionality (Qian et al., 2016). Considering the relaxation to the intrinsic dimensionality of PTMs, more suitable ap- proaches such as sequential random embedding (Qian et al., 2016) and other more advanced methods of constructing the random projection matrix (Letham et al., 2020) should be explored in future work. Besides, the subspace generated by random projection can be sub-optimal. As demonstrated in Qin et al. (2021), training the projection A with multi- task supervision can result in better and smaller subspace. Besides, larger PTMs generally have lower intrinsic dimen- sionalities (Aghajanyan et al., 2021), as a result, we can use smaller subspace and more efÔ¨Åcient DFO algorithms such as Bayesian optimization on larger PTMs. Comparison with Previous Prompt-Based Learning Ap- proaches. From the perspective of prompt-based learning, our method is similar to prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021), where only the continuous prompt prepended to the input text is tuned, so our method also retains the beneÔ¨Åts of efÔ¨Å- cient serving and mixed-task inference. In addition to the continuous prompt, we also insert some hard prompt tokens (e.g., ‚ÄùIt was [MASK]‚Äù) in the input text, which has been demonstrated to be effective in previous work (Gu et al., 2021) in the name of hybrid prompt tuning. Different from previous prompt-based learning approaches, our prompt tun-Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service ing does not require backpropagation and gradient descent. Considering our used templates and label words are hand- crafted without trial-and-error, the performance reported in this paper is just a lower bound. More advanced techniques such as prompt engineering (Gao et al., 2021), label words engineering (Schick et al., 2020; Shin et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2021b), prompt pre-training (Gu et al., 2021), and prompt ensembling (Lester et al., 2021) are orthogonal to this work and therefore can further improve the performance. For simplicity, we do not integrate these methods and leave for future work.

Additional Experimental Results Random Projection. The random projection matrix A ‚ààRD√ód is a key factor that determines whether and how hard it is to Ô¨Ånd a good solution in the generated subspace. Here we compare two design choices of setting A: The Ô¨Årst choice is commonly used in previous high-dimensional derivative-free optimization work (Wang et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2016), that is setting each entry of A by sampling from a normal distribution. Following Qian et al. (2016), we use N(0,1/d) where d is the subspace dimensionality5. The second choice is setting each entry of A by sampling from a uniform distribution, which is widely used for initializing linear layers in modern neural networks. Here we use the uniform distribution proposed in He et al. (2015). As shown in Figure 4, both random projections can achieve a considerable cross entropy loss on SST-2 and AG‚Äôs News within reasonable budgets but faster convergence is obtained using uniform distribution. 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Number of API calls 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40Cross Entropy Loss SST-2 Normal Uniform 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Number of API calls 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8Cross Entropy Loss AG's News Normal Uniform Figure 4.Effect of random projection A. Population Size. In each iteration of the CMA-ES, a population of solutions are sampled from a multivariate normal distribution model. The evaluation of the population is then used to update the parameters of the multivariate normal distribution model. Here we study the effect of the population size on SST-2. In our experiments, we sequentially evaluate each solution in a population, and therefore larger population size will result in more API calls given the same CMA-ES iterations. As shown in Figure 5, smaller population size confers faster convergence in terms of number of API calls. We also demonstrate the comparison in terms of the CMA-ES iterations, which can be found in the following section. 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Number of API calls 82.5 85.0 87.5 90.0 92.5 95.0 97.5 100.0Train accuracy (current best) SST-2 (train) Pop. size=5 Pop. size=10 Pop. size=15 Pop. size=20 Pop. size=25 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Number of API calls 84 86 88 90 92 94Dev accuracy (current best) SST-2 (dev) Pop. size=5 Pop. size=10 Pop. size=15 Pop. size=20 Pop. size=25 Figure 5.Effect of population size Œª. 5We also tried N(0,1) as used in Wang et al.

Ablation of Subspace Dimensionality and Prompt Length in 16-shot Setting. In ¬ß 4.3, we conduct ablation experi- ments in the 64-shot setting to reduce the variance over different runs. To keep consistent with the experimental setting in Table 3, we demonstrate in Figure 6 the ablation results on subspace dimensionality and prompt length in the 16-shot setting. CMA-ES vs. Adam in Subspaces. In Figure 3, we compare the convergence of prompt tuning (with Adam optimizer) and black-box tuning (with CMA-ES), where Adam performs optimization in the original prompt space (P) while CMA-ES performs in the generated subsapce (Z). Here we also compare the effectiveness and efÔ¨Åciency of Adam and CMA-ES in subspaces. As shown in Figure 7, CMA-ES is more efÔ¨Åcient and stable than Adam in low-dimensional subspaces. When the dimensionality of the subsapce becomes large (e.g., d= 1000), Adam with a appropriate learning rate can perform on par with CMA-ES. Note that CMA-ES does not require back-propagation, so the computation cost of one iteration for CMA-ES and Adam can be very different. For fair comparison, we convert the number of iterations into FLOPs. The FLOPs of one iteration of Adam is estimated to be three times greater than CMA-ES. B. Parallel Evaluation If the training data is smaller, or the server allows larger batches, a promising way to improve training efÔ¨Åciency is to use parallel evaluation. That is, we can evaluate the entire population in parallel, as depicted in Figure 8(a). As demonstrated in Figure 8(b), we can achieve 100% accuracy on the SST-2 training set with population size of 20 and 25 in 300 iterations (API calls). In case of the batch size per API call is limited, we can also use asynchronous queries to simulate the parallel evaluation. C. Estimation of Uploaded/Downloaded Data Size In this section we describe how we estimate the amount of data to be uploaded and downloaded (Table 4). For black-box tuning, there are two kinds of data to be uploaded: (1) training samples, and (2) continuous prompt. A training sample is comprised of two parts: input ids and attention mask. We can use the unsigned short (representation range: 0‚àº65535, 2 bytes per value) for input ids and use the bool type (1 byte per value) for attention mask. For continuous prompt, which contains hundreds of values, we can use the Ô¨Çoat type (4 bytes per value) for representation.Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service Serial Evaluation Population Logits Data Parallel Evaluation (a) 0 100 200 300 Iterations of CMA-ES 82.5 85.0 87.5 90.0 92.5 95.0 97.5 100.0Train accuracy (current best) SST-2 (train) Pop. size=5 Pop. size=10 Pop. size=15 Pop. size=20 Pop. size=25 (b) Figure 8.(a) Illustration of the parallel evaluation. (b) Comparison of the convergence rate with different population sizes using parallel evaluation. Take SST-2 16-shot split as an example, the input ids and attention mask are in shape of 32 √ó47, where 32 is the batch size and 47 is the maximum sequence length, so there are ‚àº2.9KB data for input ids and ‚àº1.5KB data for attention mask. Assume the prompt is 500-dimensional, we need to upload additional ‚àº2KB data for prompt. The data to be downloaded is the output logits of the candidate words, which is a dictionary containing |Y| Ô¨Çoat values. Take SST-2 16-shot split as an example, the size of data to be downloaded is32 √ó2 √ó4bytes = 0.25KB. For feature-based methods we use similar estimation methods. The data size for upload is the same for Feature-MLP and Feature-BiLSTM. The data to be downloaded for Feature-MLP is the representation of the [CLS] token while the data to be downloaded for Feature-BiLSTM is the representation of all the tokens. Note that this estimation, without any data compression, is an upper bound of the real scenario.",

Introduction Scaling pre-trained language models (PTMs) has shown increasing power on a wide range of NLP tasks (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020; 2021b; Zeng et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2021; Qiu et al., 2020). Extremely large PTMs can easily generalize to various downstream tasks with a few labeled samples (Brown et al., 2020). However, making these large PTMs beneÔ¨Åt everyone is a challenge. On the one hand, running such models can be very expensive or even infeasible for most users. On the other hand, the model parameters are often not open-sourced due to commercial 1Fudan University 2East China Normal University 3Peng Cheng Laboratory.

Users Query  Response Server Mixed-Task Batch PTM Inference (Black-Box)  Task Prompt (Tunable) Samples Update Prompt Figure 1.Illustration of Language-Model-as-a-Service (LMaaS). Users can query the PTM deployed on the server through a black- box API. In each query, users can input a task prompt and a batch of texts. On the server side, the samples can be mixed in a large batch to be fed into the PTM. By iteratively querying the PTM through the black-box API, users can optimize and Ô¨Ånally obtain good prompts to solve the language tasks of interest. considerations and the potential risk of misuse.1 Therefore, large PTMs such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), ERNIE 3.0 (Sun et al., 2021) and Yuan 1.0 (Wu et al., 2021) are usually released as a service, allowing users to access these powerful models through black-box APIs. In this scenario, called Language-Model-as-a-Service (LMaaS), users can solve the language tasks of interest using the black-box APIs by crafting task-speciÔ¨Åc text prompts or including training samples in the input texts (a.k.a. in- context learning (Brown et al., 2020)). Due to the great power of the general-purpose PTMs underlying the APIs, such approaches can achieve considerable performance on simple language tasks, and therefore have powered many interesting applications2. However, querying large PTMs through hand-crafted text prompts cannot fully exploit la- beled data, resulting in unsatisfactory performance in many use cases. Instead of designing discrete text prompts, recently much effort has been devoted to continuous prompt tuning (Li & Liang, 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2021; Liu et al., 1https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/ 2See https://gpt3demo.com/ for examples. arXiv:2201.03514v4  [cs.CL]  27 Jun 2022Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service 2021b), which is to optimize the continuous prompt injected to the text while keeping the PTM parameters frozen. Such methods only require storing a small continuous prompt for each task, and therefore are highly deployment-efÔ¨Åcient. Besides, tuning the continuous prompt can be as effective as Ô¨Åne-tuning the entire model when the PTM becomes large (Lester et al., 2021). However, in all the previous methods, the continuous prompts are learned through back- propagation, which is unavailable in the scenario of LMaaS. Can we optimize the task-speciÔ¨Åc continuous prompts when we only have access to the PTM inference API? Since gradients are unavailable, we can only invoke derivative-free optimization (DFO) 3 (Kolda et al., 2003; Conn et al., 2009; Rios & Sahinidis, 2013). DFO involves a kind of optimization algorithms that do not depend on gra- dients, but only relies on function values (or Ô¨Åtness values) of sampled solutions. However, DFO algorithms are known to suffer from slow convergence rate when the dimension- ality of the search space is high. Thus, it is intractable to optimize even only the continuous prompts, which can be tens of thousands of parameters, using DFO algorithms. Fortunately, recent work found that common PTMs, despite their large numbers of parameters, have a very low intrinsic dimensionality (Aghajanyan et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2021). That means, there exists a low-dimensional reparameteriza- tion that is as effective for Ô¨Åne-tuning as the full parameter space. It has been demonstrated that optimizing only hun- dreds (Aghajanyan et al., 2021) or even dozens (Qin et al., 2021) of parameters can achieve non-trivial performance. Given that the intrinsic dimensionality of the objective func- tion (in our case is the forward computation of PTMs) is low, the optimization can be effectively solved via DFO al- gorithms with random embedding (Wang et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2016; Letham et al., 2020). Based on the these insights, this paper proposes the Black- Box Tuning (BBT) to solve various language understand- ing tasks by only accessing the PTM inference API. In particular, we manage to optimize the continuous prompt prepended to the input text by iteratively querying the PTM inference API, as brieÔ¨Çy depicted in Figure 1. To han- dle the high dimensionality of the continuous prompt, we project the original prompt space using a random linear projection onto a much smaller subspace and solve this optimization problem with some derivative-free optimizer in that smaller subsapce. In contrast to conventional Ô¨Åne- tuning methods that can only be performed by the service side, black-box tuning allows users to optimize their task- speciÔ¨Åc prompts locally on resource-limited devices (even without GPUs). Our experimental results demonstrate that prompting RoBERTaLARGE (Liu et al., 2019) using BBT on 3Also termed as black-box, zeroth-order or gradient-free opti- mization. a few labeled samples not only outperforms manual prompt and in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020), but also out- performs its gradient-based counterparts, namely prompt tuning (Lester et al., 2021) and full model tuning. The contribution of this paper is three folds:4 ‚Ä¢ This paper proposes a novel scenario (LMaaS) where one should learn to prompt the PTMs by only accessing their inference APIs. ‚Ä¢ This paper offers a solution (BBT) for such a scenario to accomplish common language understanding tasks without access to model parameters and gradients, such that large-scale PTMs can better beneÔ¨Åt users. ‚Ä¢ Empirical results show that DFO can successfully deal with real-world language tasks by learning to prompt large-scale PTMs with more than millions of parame- ters. Thus, this work pioneers the work of optimizing large-scale PTMs through DFO methods. 2. Background Large-Scale PTMs as APIs. It is a promising way to de- ploy large-scale PTMs to serve downstream applications by providing general-purpose APIs. For the service side, wrapping the computation of the PTM into an easy-to-use API has become a common practice (Brown et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2021). In contrast to training, the in- ference speed of large-scale PTMs can be highly optimized with acceleration techniques such as ORT and TensorRT. In addition, large-scale PTMs are often not open-sourced due to the commercial reasons and the potential risk of mis- use. For the user side , even if the large-scale PTMs are available, it is expensive or even infeasible to locally run them. Thus, how to exploit the PTM inference API to solve conventional language tasks is a promising direction. Intrinsic Dimensionality of PTMs. The intrinsic dimen- sionality of an objective function is the minimum number of parameters needed to obtain satisfactory solutions (Li et al., 2018). In particular, the intrinsic dimensionality in- dicates the lowest dimensional reparameterization that is as effective for optimizing as the full parameter space. Li et al. (2018) propose to measure the intrinsic dimensionality of neural networks by Ô¨Ånding the minimal dimensionality of the subspace that is randomly projected from the full trainable parameters, in which they can optimize the neural networks to achieve satisfactory solutions. Aghajanyan et al. (2021) empirically show that large-scale pre-training implic- itly compresses the intrinsic dimensionality of downstream NLP tasks. By tuning only hundreds of parameters that 4Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ txsun1997/Black-Box-TuningBlack-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service are then randomly projected onto the full parameter space of RoBERTa, they can achieve 90% performance relative to full model tuning. Qin et al. (2021) show that intrinsic subspace on various tasks can be compressed to less than 100 dimensions with multi-task supervision. This line of research, along with the work of parameter-efÔ¨Åcient tun- ing (Houlsby et al., 2019; Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2021a; He et al., 2021), demonstrate that PTMs can well adapt to downstream tasks by tuning a very small proportion of parameters, which im- plies the possibility of optimizing large-scale PTMs with derivative-free algorithms. Prompt-Based Learning. Prompt-based learning is to formulate downstream tasks as a (masked) language mod- eling task, and therefore reduces the gap between PTM pre-training and Ô¨Åne-tuning (Brown et al., 2020; Schick & Sch¬®utze, 2021a;b; Gao et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2022). For instance, one can use BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) to predict whether the sentence ‚ÄùThis is a fantastic movie‚Äù is positive or negative by appending the prompt ‚ÄùIt was [MASK]‚Äù and see if BERT predicts ‚Äùgreat‚Äù or ‚Äùterrible‚Äù at the masked position. Note that the prompt is not necessarily discrete, it can also be optimized efÔ¨Åciently in continuous space with gradient descent (Li & Liang, 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2021; Qin & Eisner, 2021; Liu et al., 2021b; Zhong et al., 2021). In the case of only tuning the continuous prompt while keeping the parameters of large PTMs untouched, one can retain the efÔ¨Åcient serving beneÔ¨Åts while matching the performance of full model tuning (Lester et al., 2021). Our work also proposes to optimize the continuous prompt while keeping the PTM parameters unchanged, but without gradient descent. Derivative-Free Optimization. Derivative-free optimiza- tion (DFO) realizes optimization only via the function val- ues f(x) on the sampled solutions x. Most DFO algorithms share a common structure of sampling-and-updating to en- hance the quality of solutions. Representative DFO algo- rithms include evolutionary algorithms (Hansen et al., 2003), Bayesian optimization (Shahriari et al., 2016), etc. Due to their ability of addressing complex optimization tasks, DFO algorithms have achieved many impressive applica- tions in automatic machine learning (Snoek et al., 2012), reinforcement learning (Salimans et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2017), objective detection (Zhang et al., 2015b), etc. 3. Approach 3.1. Problem Formulation Common language understanding tasks can be formulated as a classiÔ¨Åcation task, which is to predict for a batch of input texts X the labels Y. To solve the target language understanding task with a general-purpose PTM, we should modify X with some template (e.g., adding some trigger words and a special token [MASK] for BERT-like PTMs) and map the labels Y to some words in the PTM vocab- ulary (e.g., the sentiment label ‚Äùpositive‚Äù can be mapped to ‚Äùgreat‚Äù). The modiÔ¨Åed inputs and labels are denoted as ÀúX and ÀúY. Assume the BERT-like PTM inference API f takes a continuous prompt p and a batch of modiÔ¨Åed texts ÀúX as input, and outputs the logits on the masked positions, i.e., ÀÜY = f(p; ÀúX). With the output logits, we can calculate the loss on this batch of data, which is not necessarily to be differentiable. Our goal is to Ô¨Ånd the optimal prompt p‚ãÜ = arg minp‚ààPL(f(p; ÀúX),ÀúY), where Pis some search space of interest and Lis some loss function such as nega- tive accuracy. The black-box function f is not available to the optimizer in closed form, but can be evaluated at a query point (p; ÀúX). 3.2. Black-Box Tuning As demonstrated by Lester et al. (2021), dozens of prompt to- kens are required to obtain a competitive performance when only tuning continuous prompts. Given that the embedding dimensionality of large-scale PTMs is usually larger than one thousand (e.g., the word embeddings of RoBERTaLARGE are 1024-dimensional), the dimensionality of the continuous prompt p ‚ààRD that we are interested to optimize can be tens of thousands, which makes derivative-free optimization intractable. To handle this high-dimensional optimization, since large-scale PTMs have a low intrinsic dimensional- ity (Aghajanyan et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2021), we manage to optimize z ‚ààRd in a much smaller subspace (d‚â™D), and use a random projection matrix A ‚ààRD√ód to project z on the original prompt space P. Note that directly projecting z onto the prompt space that is compatible with the PTM is non-trivial. To ease the optimization, we instead optimize the increment of some initial prompt p0. For simplicity, we randomly sample n tokens from the PTM vocabulary as initialization. Thus, our objective becomes z‚ãÜ = arg min z‚ààZ L(f(Az + p0; ÀúX),ÀúY) , (1) where Zis the search space. Previous work (Wang et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2016; Letham et al., 2020) in derivative- free optimization usually sets each entry in the random matrix A by sampling from some normal distribution. How- ever, this sampling strategy does not perform well in our scenario. Instead, we set values of the random matrix A by sampling from a uniform distribution adopted in He et al. (2015) (cf. Appendix A for the comparison). We restrict the search space to Z= [‚àí5,5]d. For the loss functionL, a straightforward alternative is using negative accuracy. However, the reward of accuracy can beBlack-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service Best film ever . It was <MASK> . A totally boring movie ! It was <MASK> . You 'll probably love it .

Given z ‚ààRd provided by the derivative-free optimizer, we project it to the prompt space by a random matrix A ‚ààRD√ód. By adding the projected prompt embeddings Az with some initial prompt embeddings p0 (in this illustration are the embeddings of tokens randomly sampled from the PTM‚Äôs vocabulary), we obtain the Ô¨Ånal prompt embeddings that are then concatenated with the input texts ÀúX. By calling the black-box API f, which implements the forward computation of the PTM, the predictions on the masked positions are obtained, i.e., ÀÜY = f(p; ÀúX). With the prediction ÀÜY and the golden labels ÀúY at hand, we can calculate the loss that is used by the derivative-free optimizer to suggest a new z. sparse and less informative, especially when training data is limited. Thus, we also consider two loss functions that are more sensitive to predictions, i.e., cross entropy and hinge loss. Given the output logits ÀÜ yover a candidate set of label words, and the golden label word Àúyof a certain sample, the cross entropy is deÔ¨Åned as LCE(ÀÜ y,Àúy) =‚àílog SoftmaxÀúy(ÀÜ y). (2) For hinge loss, we adopt a multi-class extension (Weston & Watkins, 1999), LHinge(ÀÜ y,Àúy) = ‚àë iÃ∏=Àúy max(0,Œ≥ + ÀÜ yi ‚àíÀÜ yÀúy). (3) In this work we set the margin Œ≥ = 2. The performances of using cross entropy, hinge loss, and negative accuracy are compared in Figure 3. 3.3. The CMA Evolution Strategy As demonstrated in Aghajanyan et al. (2021), the intrinsic dimensionality of PTMs like RoBERTa LARGE on various tasks can be hundreds. To handle optimization of such scale, we adopt the CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evo- lution Strategy) (Hansen & Ostermeier, 2001; Hansen et al., 2003), which is a widely used evolutionary algorithm for non-convex black-box optimization in continuous domain. In particular, CMA-ES maintains a parameterized search distribution model, i.e., multivariate normal distribution. In each iteration, CMA-ES samples a population of new query solutions (also referred to as individuals or offspring) from the multivariate normal distribution model z(t+1) i ‚àºm(t) + œÉ(t)N(0,C(t)) , (4) where i= 1,...,Œª and Œªis the population size. m(t) ‚ààRd is the mean vector of the search distribution at iteration step t, œÉ(t) ‚ààR+ is the overall standard deviation that controls the step length, and C(t) ‚ààRd√ód is the covariance matrix that determines the shape of the distribution ellipsoid. By maximizing the likelihood of successful steps, m(t), œÉ(t), C(t) are updated (cf. Hansen (2016) for more details). 3.4. Pre-Training Prompt Embedding Considering that sentence-pair tasks can share the same template and label words, as shown in Table 1, we can pre- train a prompt embedding p0 on some publicly available NLI task (in our experiments we use the MNLI (Williams et al., 2018) training set) for a better initialization. For other classiÔ¨Åcation tasks we set p0 as word embeddings randomly drawn from the vocabulary of RoBERTaLARGE. 4. Experiments 4.1. Setup Dataset. We conduct experiments on several common language understanding tasks including sentiment analy- sis, topic classiÔ¨Åcation, natural language inference (NLI),Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service Table 1.Statistics, manual templates, and label words used in our experiments. |Y| : number of classes.

For sentiment analysis, we choose SST- 2 (Socher et al., 2013) and Yelp polarity (Zhang et al., 2015a). For topic classiÔ¨Åcation, we choose AG‚Äôs News and DBPedia (Zhang et al., 2015a). For NLI, we choose SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015) and RTE (Wang et al., 2019). For paraphrase, we choose MRPC (Dolan & Brockett, 2005). The statistics, manual templates and label words of these datasets are shown in Table 1. Few-Shot Setting. For a broad range of users, the amount of labeled data can be limited, in which case they can resort to the deployed large PTMs due to their great power of few- shot learning (Brown et al., 2020). Hence, in this paper we conduct experiments in the few-shot setting. We randomly select ksamples for each class to construct a k-shot training set Dtrain, and compose a development set Ddev by randomly drawing another ksamples from the original training set and ensure that |Dtrain|= |Ddev|to simulate the true few-shot learning setting (Perez et al., 2021). Following Zhang et al. (2021a), Gao et al. (2021), and Gu et al. (2021), we use the original development sets as the test sets. For datasets with- out development sets, we use the original test sets. Hence, in our experiments |Dtest|‚â´|D train|= |Ddev|. Backbone Model. We choose RoBERTaLARGE (Liu et al., 2019) as our backbone model because: (1) We mainly fo- cus on language understanding tasks; (2) Aghajanyan et al. (2021) have demonstrated that RoBERTaLARGE has a very small intrinsic dimensionality (about hundreds) on many tasks. It is worth noting that generative PTMs such as GPT (Brown et al., 2020), T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) and BART (Lewis et al., 2020) are also compatible with our framework if we convert downstream tasks into a uniÔ¨Åed text-to-text format. We leave for future work the applica- tions of generative PTMs. Baselines. We compare our proposed black-box tuning with two kinds of methods: gradient-based methods and gradient-free methods. For gradient-based methods, we consider three baselines: (1) Prompt Tuning: Following Lester et al. (2021), we only train the continuous prompts Table 2.Default conÔ¨Åguration of hyper-parameters. Hyper-parameter Default Prompt length (L) 50 Subspace dimension (d) 500 Population size (Œª) 20 Random projection (A) Uniform Loss functionL Cross Entropy Budget (# of API calls) 8000 prepended to the input texts while keeping the PTM frozen. We use an Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015) with learn- ing rate of 5e-4 and batch size of 16 for 1000 epochs. For fair comparison, we use the same prompt length, manual template, label words, and the same pre-trained prompt em- bedding for initialization on sentence-pair tasks as black-box tuning. (2) P-Tuning v2 (Liu et al., 2021a) is an improved variant of prompt tuning. Instead of injecting continuous prompts merely into the input layer, P-Tuning v2 prepends and optimizes continuous prompts at every layer of the PTM. We optimize the prompts of length 128 at each layer using an Adam optimizer with learning rate of 5e-4 and batch size of 32 for 2000 epochs. (3) Model Tuning: We Ô¨Åne-tune the entire PTM on each task using an Adam optimizer with learning rate of 1e-5 and batch size of 16 for 200 epochs. For gradient-free methods, we consider three baselines: (1) Manual Prompt: We directly use the templates and label words in Table 1 to conduct zero-shot evaluation. The re- sults of manual prompt can be seen as initial points of our method. (2) In-context Learning: Following Brown et al. (2020), we randomly select up to 32 training samples and concatenate them with the input texts. (3) Feature-based Methods: Feature-based methods (Peters et al., 2019) is also a competitive baseline for LMaaS, where one can re- quest the features encoded by the large PTM and locally train a classiÔ¨Åer to accomplish the task of interest. Here we consider two implementations: (a) Feature-MLP: We train a two-layered MLP classiÔ¨Åer on the [CLS] representation of the PTM. (b) Feature-BiLSTM: We train a bidirectional LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) on the repre- sentations of the sequence of tokens, followed by a linear classiÔ¨Åer on the top. For both implementations of feature-Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service based methods, we use an Adam optimizer with learning rate of 3e-4 and batch size of 16 to train the attached clas- siÔ¨Åers for 1000 epochs. For black-box tuning, we give in Table 2 the default conÔ¨Åguration of hyper-parameters used in our experiments. The effect of each hyper-parameter is explored in ¬ß 4.3. 4.2. Results Overall Comparison. We Ô¨Årst demonstrate the experi- mental results of black-box tuning and the baselines across 7 datasets in Table 3. The proposed black-box tuning sig- niÔ¨Åcantly outperforms the other four gradient-free methods. We observe that in-context learning performs even worse than manual prompt on some tasks, and suffers from high variance. That means, in-context learning cannot effectively utilize labeled samples included in the context. Feature- based methods perform slightly better than manual prompt and in-context learning. Meanwhile, Feature-BiLSTM out- performs Feature-MLP due to its advantage of using more informative features. Surprisingly, black-box tuning also outperforms its gradient-based counterparts, namely prompt tuning, p-tuning v2, and model tuning, on average perfor- mance of the 7 tasks. Note that the only difference between prompt tuning and black-box tuning is whether we use gra- dient descent (i.e., Adam optimizer) or DFO algorithm (i.e., CMA-ES). Based on the experimental results, we suspect that gradient-based optimization tends to overÔ¨Åt the small training data while DFO tends to Ô¨Ånd better solutions due to its exploration mechanism. In addition, we Ô¨Ånd that model tuning performs much better than prompt tuning and black- box tuning when number of classes is large (e.g., DBPedia). On NLI tasks (i.e., SNLI and RTE), when using pre-trained prompt embedding (¬ß 3.4), prompt tuning and black-box tuning signiÔ¨Åcantly outperform model tuning, which also conÔ¨Årms the effectiveness of prompt pre-training (Gu et al., 2021) in the context of black-box tuning. Detailed Comparison. In the scenario of LMaaS, there are many other factors to be considered. In Table 4 we com- pare black-box tuning and the baseline methods in terms of deployment efÔ¨Åciency, viability of as-a-service, training time, memory usage on the user side and the server side, and the amount of data to be uploaded and downloaded. Model tuning is not deployment-efÔ¨Åcient because it needs to main- tain a copy of the entire model for each user. Gradient-based methods cannot make the PTM serve as a service due to the requirement of gradients. Feature-based methods and black-box tuning are suitable for LMaaS. However, feature- based methods cannot achieve competitive results when labeled data is limited. Therefore, among all the considered methods, only black-box tuning can achieve satisfactory performance while maintaining reasonable training time, memory footprint, and network load. Unlike gradient-based methods, in which the optimization cost is proportional to the size of the PTM, the optimization cost of black-box tuning is decoupled from the scale of the PTM, and only relies on the subspace dimensionality. For fair compari- son of training time, we perform early stopping for all the compared methods, i.e., we stop learning if the development accuracy does not increase after 1000 steps. All the methods are implemented with PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019) and ex- perimented on a single NVIDIA GTX 3090 GPU. Note that the process of model inference can be further accelerated via better implementations (e.g., using ONNX and TensorRT). In Table 4 we also report the training time of black-box tuning using ONNX Runtime. Detailed calculation of the amount of data to be uploaded/downloaded can be found in Appendix C. 4.3. Ablation Study In this section, we conduct ablation experiments on various hyper-parameters. To control experimental variables, we explore the effect of each hyper-parameter while keeping the other hyper-parameters as default as listed in Table 2. To stablize the experimental results and reduce the variance over different runs, we conduct ablation experiments in 64- shot setting. Each run is performed on the same data split with different random seeds. Experimental results of abla- tions on loss functions L, subspace dimensionality d, and prompt length Lare demonstrated in Figure 3. Additional ablation studies on the effect of the random projection A, the effect of the population size Œª, and the ablations in the 16-shot setting are in Appendix A. For each ablation, we show results under different budget, which is measured by the number of PTM inference API calls. In each API call, one can provide a continuous prompt p and query the results of the PTM forward computation on a batch of training data. In our few-shot setting, we can put all the training data into one batch, and therefore the objective function to be optimized is deterministic instead of stochastic. CMA-ES vs. Adam. We compare our used derivative- free optimizer, CMA-ES, with a competitive Ô¨Årst-order opti- mizer, Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015). For fair comparison, we update the continuous prompt using Adam with the gra- dients over the entire training data (i.e., batch size equals to |Dtrain|). We use learning rate of 1e-3 for Adam opti- mizer. As shown in the top row of Figure 3, Adam optimizer achieves faster convergence on both SST-2 and AG‚Äôs News due to the gradients it used. On the development sets, Adam performs slight worse than CMA-ES with cross entropy on SST-2 but better on AG‚Äôs News. But as demonstrated in Ta- ble 3, using Adam optimizer performs worse than CMA-ES on the average performance across seven task test sets.Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service Table 3.Overall comparison on various language understanding tasks. We report mean and standard deviation of performance over 3 different splits (¬ß 4.1). All of the results are obtained with pre-trained RoBERTaLARGE in 16-shot (per class) setting.

We consider three loss functions: cross entropy, hinge loss, and negative accuracy. As depicted in the top row of Figure 3, cross entropy and hinge loss signif- icantly outperform the negative accuracy. In the few-shot setting, the accuracy as a reward can be sparse, and cannot provide informative directions for optimization. On SST- 2 and AG‚Äôs News, we obtain that cross entropy performs slightly better than hinge loss. Subspace Dimensionality. The subspace of dimensional- ity dis the space where the optimization actually performs. According to the intrinsic dimensionality found in Agha- janyan et al. (2021), we explore the subspace dimensionality of {100, 200, 500, 1000}within the budget of {2k, 4k, 6k, 8k}. Accordingly, we set population size Œª= 4 + 3 log(d). As shown in the middle row of Figure 3, the best subspace dimensionality can be different on different tasks (d= 200 performs the best on SST-2 development set and d= 500 performs the best on AG‚Äôs News development set), which is related to the observation that intrinsic dimensionality varies across different tasks (Aghajanyan et al., 2021). In general, a small subspace (e.g., d= 100) is hard to cover a good solution, while a large subspace (e.g., d= 1000) may lead to poor generalization. Prompt Length. Prompt length L determines the di- mensionality of the original parameter space (in our case D= L√ó1024). We evaluate black-box tuning under each budget in {2k, 4k, 6k, 8k}while varying the prompt length in {10, 20, 50, 100}. As shown in the bottom row of Fig- ure 3, shorter prompt confers faster convergence on the training sets but does not yield better generalization on the development sets. L = 50achieves the best accuracy on both SST-2 and AG‚Äôs News development sets.Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Iterations over entire training data (| train|=128) 82.5 85.0 87.5 90.0 92.5 95.0 97.5 100.0Train accuracy (current best) SST-2 (train) Adam (cross entropy) CMA-ES (cross entropy) CMA-ES (hinge loss) CMA-ES (-accuracy) 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Iterations over entire training data (| train|=128) 77.5 80.0 82.5 85.0 87.5 90.0 92.5 95.0Dev accuracy (current best) SST-2 (dev) Adam (cross entropy) CMA-ES (cross entropy) CMA-ES (hinge loss) CMA-ES (-accuracy) 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Iterations over entire training data (| train|=128) 75 80 85 90 95 100Train accuracy (current best) AG's News (train) Adam (cross entropy) CMA-ES (cross entropy) CMA-ES (hinge loss) CMA-ES (-accuracy) 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Iterations over entire training data (| train|=128) 78 80 82 84 86 88 90Dev accuracy (current best) AG's News (dev) Adam (cross entropy) CMA-ES (cross entropy) CMA-ES (hinge loss) CMA-ES (-accuracy) 2000 4000 6000 8000 Budget (number of API calls) 94 95 96 97 98 99 100Train accuracy (current best) SST-2 (train) d = 1000 d = 500 d = 200 d = 100 2000 4000 6000 8000 Budget (number of API calls) 89 90 91 92 93 94Dev accuracy (current best) SST-2 (dev) d = 1000 d = 500 d = 200 d = 100 2000 4000 6000 8000 Budget (number of API calls) 84 86 88 90 92Train accuracy (current best) AG's News (train) d = 1000 d = 500 d = 200 d = 100 2000 4000 6000 8000 Budget (number of API calls) 83 84 85 86 87 88Dev accuracy (current best) AG's News (dev) d = 1000 d = 500 d = 200 d = 100 2000 4000 6000 8000 Budget (number of API calls) 95 96 97 98 99 100Train accuracy (current best) SST-2 (train) L = 10 L = 20 L = 50 L = 100 2000 4000 6000 8000 Budget (number of API calls) 88 89 90 91 92 93 94Dev accuracy (current best) SST-2 (dev) L = 10 L = 20 L = 50 L = 100 2000 4000 6000 8000 Budget (number of API calls) 82 84 86 88 90 92 94Train accuracy (current best) AG's News (train) L = 10 L = 20 L = 50 L = 100 2000 4000 6000 8000 Budget (number of API calls) 83 84 85 86 87 88Dev accuracy (current best) AG's News (dev) L = 10 L = 20 L = 50 L = 100 Figure 3.Ablations of loss function, subspace dimensionality, and prompt length. We show mean and standard deviation of performance over 3 runs with different random seeds. Ablations of the random projection and the population size can be found in Appendix A. 5. Discussion and Future Work In this section we discuss our proposed method in the con- text of (1) derivative-free optimization and (2) prompt-based learning, respectively. By drawing comparisons with these two lines of research, we highlight some directions that could improve this work in future. Comparison with Previous Derivative-Free Approaches. Our proposed method lies in the same framework of previ- ous work that solves high-dimensional derivative-free op- timization problems via random embedding (Wang et al., 2016). In contrast, we set the random embedding A by sampling from a uniform distribution instead of normal dis- tributions, and use the CMA-ES to perform optimization in the generated subspace. In previous work, the target black- box functions are usually synthetic functions where only a few dimensions can affect the function values, and therefore most of the dimensions are strictly non-effective. In our real- world scenario, the intrinsic dimension can be approximate. In the context of PTMs, a more appropriate substitution for the term intrinsic dimensionality can be œµ-effective dimen- sionality (Qian et al., 2016). Considering the relaxation to the intrinsic dimensionality of PTMs, more suitable ap- proaches such as sequential random embedding (Qian et al., 2016) and other more advanced methods of constructing the random projection matrix (Letham et al., 2020) should be explored in future work. Besides, the subspace generated by random projection can be sub-optimal. As demonstrated in Qin et al. (2021), training the projection A with multi- task supervision can result in better and smaller subspace. Besides, larger PTMs generally have lower intrinsic dimen- sionalities (Aghajanyan et al., 2021), as a result, we can use smaller subspace and more efÔ¨Åcient DFO algorithms such as Bayesian optimization on larger PTMs. Comparison with Previous Prompt-Based Learning Ap- proaches. From the perspective of prompt-based learning, our method is similar to prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021), where only the continuous prompt prepended to the input text is tuned, so our method also retains the beneÔ¨Åts of efÔ¨Å- cient serving and mixed-task inference. In addition to the continuous prompt, we also insert some hard prompt tokens (e.g., ‚ÄùIt was [MASK]‚Äù) in the input text, which has been demonstrated to be effective in previous work (Gu et al., 2021) in the name of hybrid prompt tuning. Different from previous prompt-based learning approaches, our prompt tun-Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service ing does not require backpropagation and gradient descent. Considering our used templates and label words are hand- crafted without trial-and-error, the performance reported in this paper is just a lower bound. More advanced techniques such as prompt engineering (Gao et al., 2021), label words engineering (Schick et al., 2020; Shin et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2021b), prompt pre-training (Gu et al., 2021), and prompt ensembling (Lester et al., 2021) are orthogonal to this work and therefore can further improve the performance. For simplicity, we do not integrate these methods and leave for future work.

Additional Experimental Results Random Projection. The random projection matrix A ‚ààRD√ód is a key factor that determines whether and how hard it is to Ô¨Ånd a good solution in the generated subspace. Here we compare two design choices of setting A: The Ô¨Årst choice is commonly used in previous high-dimensional derivative-free optimization work (Wang et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2016), that is setting each entry of A by sampling from a normal distribution. Following Qian et al. (2016), we use N(0,1/d) where d is the subspace dimensionality5. The second choice is setting each entry of A by sampling from a uniform distribution, which is widely used for initializing linear layers in modern neural networks. Here we use the uniform distribution proposed in He et al. (2015). As shown in Figure 4, both random projections can achieve a considerable cross entropy loss on SST-2 and AG‚Äôs News within reasonable budgets but faster convergence is obtained using uniform distribution. 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Number of API calls 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40Cross Entropy Loss SST-2 Normal Uniform 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Number of API calls 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8Cross Entropy Loss AG's News Normal Uniform Figure 4.Effect of random projection A. Population Size. In each iteration of the CMA-ES, a population of solutions are sampled from a multivariate normal distribution model. The evaluation of the population is then used to update the parameters of the multivariate normal distribution model. Here we study the effect of the population size on SST-2. In our experiments, we sequentially evaluate each solution in a population, and therefore larger population size will result in more API calls given the same CMA-ES iterations. As shown in Figure 5, smaller population size confers faster convergence in terms of number of API calls. We also demonstrate the comparison in terms of the CMA-ES iterations, which can be found in the following section. 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Number of API calls 82.5 85.0 87.5 90.0 92.5 95.0 97.5 100.0Train accuracy (current best) SST-2 (train) Pop. size=5 Pop. size=10 Pop. size=15 Pop. size=20 Pop. size=25 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Number of API calls 84 86 88 90 92 94Dev accuracy (current best) SST-2 (dev) Pop. size=5 Pop. size=10 Pop. size=15 Pop. size=20 Pop. size=25 Figure 5.Effect of population size Œª. 5We also tried N(0,1) as used in Wang et al.

Ablation of Subspace Dimensionality and Prompt Length in 16-shot Setting. In ¬ß 4.3, we conduct ablation experi- ments in the 64-shot setting to reduce the variance over different runs. To keep consistent with the experimental setting in Table 3, we demonstrate in Figure 6 the ablation results on subspace dimensionality and prompt length in the 16-shot setting. CMA-ES vs. Adam in Subspaces. In Figure 3, we compare the convergence of prompt tuning (with Adam optimizer) and black-box tuning (with CMA-ES), where Adam performs optimization in the original prompt space (P) while CMA-ES performs in the generated subsapce (Z). Here we also compare the effectiveness and efÔ¨Åciency of Adam and CMA-ES in subspaces. As shown in Figure 7, CMA-ES is more efÔ¨Åcient and stable than Adam in low-dimensional subspaces. When the dimensionality of the subsapce becomes large (e.g., d= 1000), Adam with a appropriate learning rate can perform on par with CMA-ES. Note that CMA-ES does not require back-propagation, so the computation cost of one iteration for CMA-ES and Adam can be very different. For fair comparison, we convert the number of iterations into FLOPs. The FLOPs of one iteration of Adam is estimated to be three times greater than CMA-ES. B. Parallel Evaluation If the training data is smaller, or the server allows larger batches, a promising way to improve training efÔ¨Åciency is to use parallel evaluation. That is, we can evaluate the entire population in parallel, as depicted in Figure 8(a). As demonstrated in Figure 8(b), we can achieve 100% accuracy on the SST-2 training set with population size of 20 and 25 in 300 iterations (API calls). In case of the batch size per API call is limited, we can also use asynchronous queries to simulate the parallel evaluation. C. Estimation of Uploaded/Downloaded Data Size In this section we describe how we estimate the amount of data to be uploaded and downloaded (Table 4). For black-box tuning, there are two kinds of data to be uploaded: (1) training samples, and (2) continuous prompt. A training sample is comprised of two parts: input ids and attention mask. We can use the unsigned short (representation range: 0‚àº65535, 2 bytes per value) for input ids and use the bool type (1 byte per value) for attention mask. For continuous prompt, which contains hundreds of values, we can use the Ô¨Çoat type (4 bytes per value) for representation.Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service Serial Evaluation Population Logits Data Parallel Evaluation (a) 0 100 200 300 Iterations of CMA-ES 82.5 85.0 87.5 90.0 92.5 95.0 97.5 100.0Train accuracy (current best) SST-2 (train) Pop. size=5 Pop. size=10 Pop. size=15 Pop. size=20 Pop. size=25 (b) Figure 8.(a) Illustration of the parallel evaluation. (b) Comparison of the convergence rate with different population sizes using parallel evaluation. Take SST-2 16-shot split as an example, the input ids and attention mask are in shape of 32 √ó47, where 32 is the batch size and 47 is the maximum sequence length, so there are ‚àº2.9KB data for input ids and ‚àº1.5KB data for attention mask. Assume the prompt is 500-dimensional, we need to upload additional ‚àº2KB data for prompt. The data to be downloaded is the output logits of the candidate words, which is a dictionary containing |Y| Ô¨Çoat values. Take SST-2 16-shot split as an example, the size of data to be downloaded is32 √ó2 √ó4bytes = 0.25KB. For feature-based methods we use similar estimation methods. The data size for upload is the same for Feature-MLP and Feature-BiLSTM. The data to be downloaded for Feature-MLP is the representation of the [CLS] token while the data to be downloaded for Feature-BiLSTM is the representation of all the tokens. Note that this estimation, without any data compression, is an upper bound of the real scenario.",

Current large models consist of billions of parameters [Brown et al., 2020, Chowdhery et al., 2022], which greatly exacerbate the cost of tuning the entire model weights via gradient-based optimization. On the other hand, the power of scale in both model size and pretraining dataset size has demonstrated strong capabilities by achieving reasonable performance through a learnable prompt appended before the input [Li and Liang, 2021, Lester et al., 2021]. Despite this, several questions emanate around the abilities and limitations of prompt tuning. In this work, we aim to characterize some natural yet essential questions about prompt tuning with transformer architectures. Firstly, are prompts universal approximators, i.e. with a fixed pretrained transformer network, can we find a prompt to approximate any sequence-to-sequence function in a given space? If yes, can we construct the transformer for this universality result? Second, can we identify failure modes of prompt tuning when applied on potentially non-optimal but non-trivial transformers? Moreover, since prompt tuning is usually compared against LoRA[Hu et al., 2021] in consideration to parameter-efficient tuning, is prompt tuning then more/less parameter-efficient than LoRA? Answering these questions can lead to important insights on when and how to perform prompt tuning to adapt a pretrained transformer network to a given downstream task of interest. 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023). arXiv:2305.18787v2  [cs.LG]  16 Nov 2023In this work, we seek to answer these questions with appropriate theoretical analysis and further validate our claims with empirical results. We first characterize the universal nature of prompt tuning by constructing a specific transformer network. We show that for a given approximation error and the space of sequence-to-sequence Lipschitz functions, we can construct a transformer network, with a suitable number of layers, that can leverage prompt tuning to approximate any function in this space. Despite this universality of prompt tuning with a carefully constructed pretrained transformer, we then identify some limitations of prompt tuning with weaker but non-trivial transformers. We prove this by constructing sequence-to-sequence datasets with shared input tokens, which are surprisingly simple but cannot be memorized by prompt tuning for a given transformer. We also extend our analysis to more general settings where the shared token is not required. In this setting, we first prove that prompt tuning on a single-layer transformer requires ‚Ñ¶(n) trainable parameters to memorize n training examples, wherein for LoRA, it suffices with O(n) trainable parameters. We finally extend our analysis to the multi-layer setting and provide sufficient conditions under which prompt tuning exhibits extremely limited capacity to at best memorizing datasets from invertible functions. Our contributions can be summarized as below: ‚Ä¢ We characterize the universal nature of prompt tuning by explicitly constructing a transformer network (Theorem 1). ‚Ä¢ We provide a construction-based argument for sequence-to-sequence datasets that cannot be learned by prompt tuning with a given single-layer transformer (Theorem 2). ‚Ä¢ We provide the lower bound on the required number of parameters for prompt tuning to memorize any sequence-to-sequence functions (Theorem 3). ‚Ä¢ We provide a sufficient condition for multi-layer transformers, under which datasets with shared output tokens cannot be learned with prompt tuning (Theorem 4). ‚Ä¢ We conduct empirical studies, including real-world datasets, to verify our theoretical claims. 2 Related Work Theoretical Analysis of Transformers Various works have characterized the theoretical properties of transformers and its primary self-attention component. [Yun et al., 2020] study the universal approximation ability of transformers for continuous permutation equivariant sequence-to-sequence functions with compact support and further examined the role of using positional encodings to circumvent permutation equivariant condition. [P√©rez et al., 2021] show that transformer with a hard- attention is Turing complete based on their capacity to perform computations and access the internal dense representations of the data. [Wei et al., 2021] further show that transformers can approximate Turing machines with bounded computation time with a new notion of approximation. [Dong et al., 2021] provided a negative yet interesting result signifying the limitations of pure self-attention in terms of rank diminishing of the input. Other works including [Kim et al., 2021, Dasoulas et al., 2021] derive upper bounds on the Lipschitz constant of respective modifications of the attention mechanism. The works by [Li et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2020] documented optimization perspective on transformer training via SGD. Fine-tuning and Prompt Tuning Fine-tuning is the standard way to adapt a pretrained model to downstream tasks. The most standard and popular paradigm is tuning the model weights via a suitable optimization procedure along with a linear head on the output representations [Radford et al., 2018, Devlin et al., 2019]. Subsequent works studied more parameter-efficient ways of fine-tuning by updating either a subset of model parameters [Ben Zaken et al., 2022] or restricting the parameter- updates to a low-dimensional subspace [Aghajanyan et al., 2021, Hu et al., 2021, Mahabadi et al., 2021]. The work by [Hu et al., 2021] (their framework referred to as LoRA) has garnered particular interest in the community and [Malladi et al., 2023] has provided an interpretation of LoRA via the kernel mechanism. In the particular context of LLMs, prompt tuning has emerged as the de facto approach where only the prompt is updated while keeping the rest of the transformer weights and architecture fixed [Shin et al., 2020, Lester et al., 2021, Li and Liang, 2021]. Analysis of Prompt Tuning [Wei et al., 2022] studied the link between prompt tuning and down- stream tasks with an underlying latent variable generative model of text, which is confined to a Hidden Markov Model. However, they focused on the discrete vocabulary setting contrary to our 2results for continuous sequence-to-sequence functions. Some more recent works [Aky√ºrek et al., 2023, V on Oswald et al., 2023] characterized an intriguing property of a specific form of prompting, referred to as in-context learning, where they proved by construction that transformers can implement learning algorithms for linear models based on gradient descent and closed-form ridge regression. This work however pursued a different and specific direction from the prompting results we aim to provide for generic settings. Memorization Capacity of Neural Networks A series of works have sought to provide finite sample universal memorization capacity results of neural networks and the understanding of expres- sive power of neural networks. Huang and Huang [1990], Huang and Babri [1998], Huang [2003], Yamasaki [1993] analyzed the memorization capacity of FNNs with sigmoid and other bounded activation functions. Hardt and Ma [2016], Zhang et al. [2021], Nguyen and Hein [2018] provided results for modern ReLU networks including FNNs and CNNs. For transformer architectures, Kim et al. proved that transformers can memorize a dataset with finite parameters. To the best of our knowl- edge, similar results for prompt tuning have not been studied in continuous settings for transformer architectures. 3 Transformers and Parameter Efficient Training 3.1 Preliminaries We use the following notations throughout the paper. A bold lower case character, e.g. x, denotes a vector. A bold upper case character, e.g. W, denotes a matrix while Wi,j, Wi,: and W:,j is the (i, j)-th element, i-th row, j-th column, respectively. We use a single superscript or subscript to denote the index of a matrix, e.g. Xi, Xi denote the i-th matrix in a matrices sequence. We use œÉ and ¬ØœÉ for softmax and hardmax operators, respectively. We use ReLU(v) = max( v, 0) to denote the ReLU activation function where max(¬∑) function is applied entry-wise to a vector. We use Cone(a1, a2, ...,am) to denote a convex cone where Cone(a1, a2, ...,am) = {x : x =Pm i=1 aiai, ai > 0}. We also define the minus operation between a set S and a vector v as S ‚àív = {x‚àív : x ‚àà S}. In Section 4, we use [a : b : c] to denote a grid {a, a+ b, a+ 2b, ..., c‚àíb} from a to c, with an interval b. Transformer networks [Vaswani et al., 2017] are a stack of multiple transformer layers, composed subsequently. A transformer layer has two key components: an attention layer and a token-wise MLP layer, with residual connections around both blocks. We consider the input and output to be sequences of tokens X ‚àà Rd√óm and Y ‚àà Rd√óm, where m is the number of tokens in the sequence and d is the token dimension. Definition 1 (Attention Layer) . We define an h-head attention layer parameterized with Wq, Wk, Wv, Wo between a single token x and a token sequence X as Att(x, X) = hX i=1 Wi oWi vX ¬∑ œÉ((Wi kX)‚ä§Wi qx). (1) The normalizing factor of 1‚àö dkq is subsumed in the weight matrices Wi k for notational simplicity. We can then define the cross attention between two sequencesX1 ‚àà Rd√óm1 and X2 ‚àà Rd√óm2 (We use xk = (X1):,k for simplicity): Att(X1, X2) = [Att(x1, X2), Att(x2, X2), ...,Att(xm1 , X2)]. Definition 2 (Standard Transformer Layer). With definition 1, we define a standard transformer layer œÑ as MLP(X) = [W2ReLU(W1X:,1 + b1) + b2 + X:,1, ...,W2ReLU(W1X:,n + b1) + b2 + X:,n] (2) œÑ(X) = MLP(Att(X, X) + X). (3) The definition here omits the layer normalization block for simplicity (following [Kim et al., 2021]). We denote the set of transformer networks with h heads of size s and r MLP hidden neurons with T h,s,r. In Section 4, we utilize a modified transformer network with hardmax operation ¬ØœÉ instead of softmax œÉ. We denote this modified version of transformer networks as ¬ØT h,s,r. 3During fine-tuning, we optimize the matrices Wi q, Wi k, Wi v in the attention layer and W1, W2, b1, b2 in the MLP layer pertaining to a loss function L. However in prompt tuning, the pretrained model weight matrices are fixed and we optimize a tunable sequence prepended to the input. Prompt Tuning Given a pretrained transformer network g ‚àà Tand a downstream training dataset S = {(X1, Y1), ...,(Xn, Yn)}, prompt tuning seeks to find a promptP‚àó ‚àà Rd√ómp with mp tunable tokens under the loss function L: P‚àó = arg min P nX i=1 L(g([P, Xi]):,mp:, Yi). (4) The tunable prompt P is shared amongst all the inputs in a task. Note that P in prompt tuning is a continuously trainable parameter, alternately referred to as soft prompt, which is different from hard prompt in that the latter operates on a discrete space of predefined vocabulary. Since the representation power of soft prompts is strictly more than the hard prompts, the limitations studied in this paper also extend to hard prompts. In the subsequent sections, we analyze the universality and limitations of prompt tuning while comparing the latter against fine-tuning and LoRA[Hu et al., 2021], which is a low-rank version of model fine-tuning. In Section 4, we prove that prompt tuning can be universal approximators for sequence-to-sequence functions, while providing the construction for the same. In Sections 5 and 6, we identify the failure modes where prompt tuning cannot learn with a possibly non-optimal but non-trivial pretrained transformer network. 4 Universality of Prompt Tuning Without loss of generality, we assume that the support and range set of all considered sequence-to- sequence functions f is [0, 1]d√óm in this section. We define FL as the collection of all continuous sequence-to-sequence L-lipschitz functions under norm p and sequence length m. For f ‚àà FL and any two inputs X, X‚Ä≤ ‚àà [0, 1]d√óm, we have ‚à•f(X) ‚àí f(X‚Ä≤)‚à•p ‚â§ L‚à•X ‚àí X‚Ä≤‚à•p. Furthermore, given functions f1, f2, the approximation error under a p-norm (which is entry-wise) is measured as: dp(f1, f2) = ( Z ‚à•f1(X) ‚àí f2(X)‚à•p pdX) 1 p . (5) Primarily, we show that there exists a Transformer network g ‚àà T2,1,4 such that for any f ‚àà FL, prompt tuning on g can approximate this function upto some error budget œµ >0. Theorem 1. Let 1 ‚â§ p <‚àû and œµ >0, there exist a transformer network g ‚àà T2,1,4 and prompt length mp, such that for anyf ‚àà FL we can find a promptP ‚àà Rd√ómp with dp(g([P, ¬∑]):,mp:, f) ‚â§ œµ. Here we use the transformer in a encoder mode which generates the m outputs in one step. In Appendix C.4, a similar result can be obtained for next-token prediction, which is widely used in many recent language models. The proof is inspired from [Yun et al., 2019a], which follows the typical construction based proof mechanism to show universality. Thereby, we can construct a ‚Äúmeta-transformer‚Äù for prompt tuning to approximate any sequence-to-sequence function with prompt tuning. Next we briefly describe the two steps for the construction of this meta-transformer. We start by building a meta-function for FL. Building the Meta-Function We denote the length of all inputs as m and the prompt length as mp. Then we can build a sequence-to-sequence meta-function that accepts inputs with length m + mp. Lemma 1. For the sequence-to-sequence function space FL with functions f : [0 , 1]d√óm ‚Üí [0, 1]d√óm, we can build a sequence-to-sequence function ¬Øg : [0, 1]d√ó(mp+m) ‚Üí [0, 1]d√ó(mp+m) such that for any f ‚àà FL, we can find P ‚àà Rd√ómp, dp(¬Øg([P, ¬∑]):,mp:, f) ‚â§ œµ/2. The complete proof is given in Appendix C.1. Succinctly, we first quantize the input and output sequence space of [0, 1]d√óm into a grid GŒ¥,m = {0, Œ¥,2Œ¥, ...,1 ‚àí Œ¥}d√óm, thus leading to C = ( 1 Œ¥d√óm ) 1 Œ¥d√óm possible functions mappings from the input to the output, in this discrete space. By 4this quantized function space as ¬ØFL = { ¬Øf1, ¬Øf2, ...,¬ØfC}, we can select Œ¥ such that the approximation error for any function is less than œµ/2. Then we construct a set of quantized prompts in GŒ¥,mp = {0, Œ¥,2Œ¥, ...,1 ‚àí Œ¥}d√ómp to index these C functions and construct a quantized function ¬Øg where ¬Øg([Pi, X]):,mp: = ¬Øfi(X), i= 1, 2, ..., C, for all X ‚àà GŒ¥,m, thereby concluding the lemma. Next we can utilize some conclusions in [Yun et al., 2019a] to construct a transformer for ¬Øg. Constructing the Meta-Transformer We first introduce a useful lemma which enables the con- struction of a transformer for any quantized sequence-to-sequence function. Lemma 2. For any given quantized function ¬Øf : [0, 1]d√óm ‚Üí [0, 1]d√óm with quantization at interval Œ¥, ‚àÉ¬Øh ‚àà ¬ØT 2,1,1 such that ¬Øf = ¬Øh with positional embedding E = Ô£Æ Ô£ØÔ£ØÔ£∞ 0 1 2 ... m ‚àí 1 0 1 2 ... m ‚àí 1 ... ... ... ... ... 0 1 2 ... m ‚àí 1 Ô£π Ô£∫Ô£∫Ô£ª. The proof mainly follows the discussions in Section C of [Yun et al., 2019a]. To prove this lemma, the network ¬Øh can be constructed in the following three steps. We first use a series of MLP layers to quantize the input to grid [0 : Œ¥ : 1 ‚àí Œ¥]d√óm and then a series of attention layers to obtain a unique contextual mapping for each quantized input. Finally we can use a series of MLP layers to map the unique contextual mapping to the desired outputs. While a transformer network usually stacks self-attention and MLP layers alternately within a single layer, the aforementioned construction can be trivially attained via the use of skip connections. The complete proof of Lemma 2 is deferred to Appendix C.2. Since ¬Øg is a quantized function in grid GŒ¥,m+mp, following Lemma 2 we can find a modified version of transformer ¬Øh ‚àà ¬ØT 2,1,1 such that ¬Øg([P, X]) = ¬Øh([P, X])). The modified version of transformer ¬Øg with hardmax operators can then be approximated with a standard transformer g with softmax operators by Lemma 3. Lemma 3 (Lemma 9 in [Yun et al., 2019a]) . For each ¬Øh ‚àà ¬ØT 2,1,1, œµ > 0 and 1 ‚â§ p < ‚àû, ‚àÉg ‚àà T2,1,4 such that dp(¬Øh, g) ‚â§ œµ/2. Since the approximation error can be treated uniformly amongst the Pi, we have that dp(¬Øh([Pi, ¬∑]):,mp:, g([Pi, ¬∑]):,mp:) ‚â§ dp(¬Øh([Pi, ¬∑]), g([Pi, ¬∑]) ‚â§ œµ/2. Therefore, we can build a transformer g ‚àà T2,1,4, such that for any sequence-to-sequence f ‚àà FL, we can find a quantized version ¬Øfi ‚àà ¬ØFL and the corresponding prompt Pi ‚àà GŒ¥,mp such that dp(g([Pi, ¬∑]):,mp:, f) ‚â§ dp(g([Pi, ¬∑]):,mp:, ¬Øh([Pi, ¬∑])) + dp(¬Øh([Pi, ¬∑]):,mp:, ¬Øfi) + dp( ¬Øfi, f) ‚â§ œµ. (6) Theorem 1 provides the construction for a large transformer (discussed more in appendix) that is sufficient for prompt tuning to exhibit universal approximation over a Lipschitz function space. However, even this strong transformer also has limitations with prompt tuning when the target function f /‚àà FL. Is this an essential limitation for prompt tuning on any transformer? In the next section, we will theoretically analyze the limitations of prompt tuning with transformers and target functions under more general conditions. 5 Limitations of Prompt-Tuning: Single Layer Transformer To analyse the failure modes and therefore the limitations under the setting where a transformer has fixed pretrained weights, we follow the lens of exact memorization in the subsequent sections. Definition 3 (Memorization of a Sequence-to-Sequence Dataset). Given a sequence-to-sequence dataset S = {(X1, Y1), ...,(Xn, Yn)} where Xi, Yi ‚àà Rd√óm are the input/output sequences, we consider a function f exactly memorizing dataset S if f(Xi) = Yi. In the following proofs of this section, we explicitly focus on the last output token, ie: f(Xi):,‚àí1 = (Yi):,‚àí1. We start from the analysis on a single layer transformer and extend to multi-layer settings in Section 6. 55.1 Failure modes of Prompt Tuning It is straightforward to note that prompt tuning has limited expressive power when the number of trainable parameters is limited. A natural question to then ask is: Does increasing the number of trainable prompt tokens suffice? While it is known that for MLPs, even with a single hidden layer, increasing the number of hidden neurons can memorize any training data [Yun et al., 2019b]. However, as we will prove next, this is not the case for prompt tuning. This result highlights an essential limitation of prompt tuning compared to model fine-tuning. Before providing the theorem statement, we first outline some straightforward assumptions on the pretrained transformer and datasets, without which prompt tuning trivial loses expressive power. We consider sequence-to-sequence datasets of the form S = {(X1, Y1), (X2, Y2), ...,(Xn, Yn)} with n distinct examples and a single-layer single-head standard transformer defined in Definition 2. The results can be directly extended to the single-layer multi-head scenario, which we skip here to avoid notational clutter. Assumption 1 (Non-trivial conditions). We assume that all output tokens(Yi):,k are in the range set of MLP, otherwise the expressivity becomes trivially weak. We assume that Wq, Wk, Wv are full rank matrices and that Att(Xi, Xi) + Xi are distinct for i = 1, 2, ..., n. Assumption 2 (Assumption for the MLP layer) . We assume that d ‚â• 2 + dim((MLP‚àí1(y10) ‚àí x0) ‚à™ (MLP‚àí1(y20) ‚àí x0)) for the dataset constructed in Theorem 2 and token dimension d. dim(S) measures the dimension of subspace spanned by vectors in a set S and MLP‚àí1(y) = {x : MLP(x) = y}. We provide an example for this assumption in Example 1 and a sufficient condition in the following Lemma 4. Lemma 4. If ‚à•W1‚à•2 √ó ‚à•W2‚à•2 < 1 , where ‚à• ¬∑ ‚à•2 is the matrix spectral norm, then the MLP block in Definition 2 is invertible, ie, MLP‚àí1 is a singleton set. Therefore, if Lemma 4 holds and d ‚â• 4, Assumption 2 also holds. Proof of Lemma 4 can be found in Appendix C.5. The experimental evidence in [Dong et al., 2021] shows that for most architectures, the norm of the weight matrices indeed admits small values and thus the requirement that ‚à•W1‚à•2 √ó ‚à•W2‚à•2 < 1 is a mild condition. With these assumptions, here we introduce our first theorem on the unlearnability of prompt tuning. Theorem 2. For a single layer transformer œÑ defined above with Assumptions 1 and 2, we can build a sequence-to-sequence dataset S = {(X1 = [x1, x0], Y1 = [y11, y10]), (X2 = [x2, x0], Y2 = [y21, y20]))}, and we cannot find a promptP ‚àà Rd√ómp with any mp > 0 such that œÑ([P, Xi]) = Yi holds for any i = 1, 2. The vectors x0, x1, x2 are denoted post positional encodings. An important feature of this dataset is that the same token x0 is shared between the two examples, and the expressive capability of prompt tuning is limited by the correlation of outputs corresponding to this token in different examples. We show a concrete example here to illustrate this theorem (note that Lemma 4 is in fact not required in the following construction) and defer the formal proof to Appendix C.6. Example 1. We consider a single-head transformer layer œÑ, where b1 = b2 = 0, W1 = 1r√ód, W2 = 1d√ór. Then the token-wise MLP layer is a concatenation of two linear functions: MLP(x) = \u001a(W2W1 + I)x, (W1x)0 > 0 x , (W1x)0 ‚â§ 0 (7) Here (W1x)0 denotes the first element of vector W1x. W2W1 +I is a non-singular matrix. Therefore, for any y in MLP(X)‚Äôs output set, MLP‚àí1(y) contains at most two points {y, (W2W1 + I)‚àí1y}. We arbitrarily choose x0, y10 and y20. As long as d ‚â• 6 (from Assumption 2), we can find c1, c2 such that c1, c2 ‚ä• y10 ‚àí x0, y20 ‚àí x0, (W2W1+I)‚àí1y10‚àíx0, (W2W1+I)‚àí1y20‚àíx0, c1 ‚ä• c2. Then we choose x1 and x2 such that Att(x0, X1) ‚à• c1 and Att(x0, X2) ‚à• c2 (Lemma 7 in Appendix). Then Cone(‚àíAtt(x0, X1), a ‚àí x0) ‚à© Cone(‚àíAtt(x0, X2), b ‚àí x0) = ‚àÖ, for any a ‚àà {y10, (W2W1 + I)‚àí1y10} and b ‚àà {y20, (W2W1 + I)‚àí1y20}. Here Cone stands for a convex cone as defined in Section 3.1. 6If a P exists such that œÑ([P, Xi]) = Yi holds for both i = 1, 2, then we have Att(x0, [P, X1]) = Œª(X1, x0, [P, X1])Att(x0, X1) + Œª(P, x0, [P, X1])Att(x0, P) (8) Att(x0, [P, X2]) = Œª(X2, x0, [P, X2])Att(x0, X2) + Œª(P, x0, [P, X2])Att(x0, P) where Œª(¬∑, ¬∑, ¬∑) is a positive scalar. We also have Att(x0, [P, X1]) + x0 ‚àà MLP‚àí1(y10) Att(x0, [P, X2]) + x0 ‚àà MLP‚àí1(y20) as MLP(Att(x0, [P, Xi]) + x0) = yi0, i= 1, 2. Therefore, Att(x0, P) must be in both Cone(a ‚àí x0, ‚àíAtt(x0, X1)) and Cone(b ‚àí x0, ‚àíAtt(x0, X2)), where a ‚àà {y10, (W2W1 + I)‚àí1y10} and b ‚àà {y20, (W2W1 + I)‚àí1y20}, which contradicts the existence of P as Cone(‚àíAtt(x0, X1), a ‚àí x0) ‚à© Cone(‚àíAtt(x0, X2), b ‚àí x0) = ‚àÖ. Therefore, in this example, even though we allow an arbitrary number of trainable param- eters in prompt P, we cannot find one to exactly memorize the training set with only two training examples. This theorem reveals an important difference between prompt tuning and adjusting the model weights directly. For any training dataset S with two training examples {(X1, Y1), (X2, Y2)}, so long as Att(X1, X1) + X1 and Att(X2, X2) + X2 are distinct, MLP can easily map the post-attention features to expected output tokens with finite number of hidden neurons. As a result, tuning the MLP parameters for this pretrained transformers can memorize any dataset in the form of Assumption 1. However, prompt tuning cannot achieve this even if the number of tunable tokens‚Üí infinity, thereby limiting the expressiveness of prompt tuning when compared to model fine-tuning. 5.2 Comparison with a More General Dataset In Section 5.1, we constructed sequence-to-sequence datasets that cannot be learned by a given transformer layer with prompt tuning, by utilizing the shared token between different training examples. In this section, we compare the expressive power of prompt tuning and fine-tuning under a more general dataset construction where the former requirement can be relaxed. Since the primary essence of prompt tuning is to perform parameter-efficient tuning, wherein we seek to adapt a pretrained large model to a new task with fewer tunable parameters, we compare prompt tuning with another parameter-efficient version of model-tuning: LoRA [Hu et al., 2021]. Succinctly, we compare the required number of parameters to memorize a given dataset. Again, consider a sequence-to-sequence dataset S = {(X1, Y1), (X2, Y2), ...,(Xn, Yn)}, where Xi = [xi1, xi2, ...,xim] and Yi = [yi1, yi2, ...,yim]. We again discuss the memorization of the last output token for simplicity and results can be directly extended. We first give the required number of parameters of LoRA to memorize dataset S. Lemma 5 (LoRA). For a standard single-layer transformer œÑ defined in Definition 2 with r ‚â• n MLP hidden neurons, for any sequence-to-sequence datasetS satisfying Assumptions 1, we can apply a low-rank update to MLP weights with O(nd) parameters to memorize œÑ(Xi):,m = yim. This lemma is derived based on the memorization capabilities of 1-hidden layer MLPs [Yun et al., 2019b]. As the post-attention values for different training inputs are different from Assumption 1, we can construct a low rank update with O(nd) parameters on the MLP layer to memorize S. We defer the complete proof to Appendix C.7. For prompt tuning, we derive a result in the next theorem which shows that it requires ‚Ñ¶(nd) tunable parameters to memorize some constructed dataset S with n examples. Theorem 3 (Lower bound on Tunable Prompt Parameters). For any single layer transformerœÑ defined in Definition 2, there exists a sequence-to-sequence dataset {(X1 = [x10, x1], [y10, y11]), (X2 = [x20, x2], [y20, y21]), ...,(Xn = [ xn0, xn], [yn0, yn1])} that satisfies Assumption 1 with n < d training examples such that we need at least n prompt tokens in P to memorize the training set, ie, for œÑ([P, Xi]):,‚àí1 = yi1 to hold for all i = 1, 2, ..., n. This dataset can be constructed by including n examples that require n linearly independent prompts tokens. The complete proof is deferred to Appendix C.8. 7Note that in Theorem 3, we provide a key lower bound on the required number of prompt tokens for exact memorization and this can very well more than nd. This partially (but not necessarily) explains the worse empirical performance of prompt tuning against LoRA under a comparable number of trainable parameters. 6 Extension to Multi-Layer Setting In this section, we extend our analysis to multi-layer setting and provide a sufficient condition under which the expressiveness of prompt tuning is restricted. An immediate consequence of our result is an interesting connection to the spectral norm of soft prompts surfaces. This result provides us a partial understanding of the phenomenon that soft prompt P vectors typically exhibit larger norms compared to the actual input X, after the tuning. With some further notation adjustments, we denote an H layer pretrained transformer network as g(‚àà T) = œÑ1 ‚ó¶ œÑ2 ‚ó¶ ... ‚ó¶ œÑH, the input set as X1, and the set of possible prompts as P1. We assume that the following compactness condition is satisfied: ‚à•[Pl, Xl]‚à•2 ‚â§ Dl (9) s.t. [Pl+1, Xl+1] = œÑl([Pl, Xl]), ‚àÄl = 1, ..., H. Here [P1, X1] is the input to the first layer œÑ1 with P1 ‚àà P1, X1 ‚àà X1 and ‚à• ¬∑ ‚à•2 is the spectral norm. Similarly, [PH+1, XH+1] denotes the output set. We start by providing an upper bound to the Lipschitz constant of attention, pertaining to eq 9. This derivation is different from the works of [Dasoulas et al., 2021, Vuckovic et al., 2020] and thus can be of independent interest. Lemma 6. Under the compactness condition, the Lipschitz constant of the i-th attention head in the l-th transformer layer, denoted for simplicity as Atti,l, admits the following bound w.r.t the entire input sequence of length m: Lip(Atti,l(¬∑, ¬∑)) ‚â§ (1 + 8‚àöm(Dl)2‚à•(Wi,l k )T Wi,l q ‚à•2)‚à•Wi,l v ‚à•2, (10) and the Lipschitz constant of the entire attention block in layer l, denoted as Attl, admits the bound: Lip(Attl(¬∑, ¬∑)) ‚â§ vuut hX i=1 (‚à•Wi,l o ‚à•2 √ó Lip(Atti,l))2. (11) It is noteworthy that this upper bound is dependent on Dl, the spectral norm of the input prepended with the prompt. In conjunction with the following theorem, we obtain a result on limited expressivity of prompt tuning by showing that the transformer becomes invertible, in consideration to functions from P1 √ó X1 ‚Üí PH+1 √ó XH+1 (an extension to functions of the from X1 ‚Üí XH+1 is provided in Appendix Section C.11). Theorem 4. A transformer g ‚àà Tis invertible, ie ,g‚àí1(Y) = {X : g(X) = Y} is a singleton set ‚àÄY in range of g, if: 1. The Lipschitz constant of the attention block in each layer œÑl is strictly less than 1 2. The Lipschitz constant of the 2-layer ReLU block in each layer œÑl, which is bounded by ‚à•Wl 2‚à•2 √ó ‚à•Wl 1‚à•2, is strictly less than 1. Proof of Theorem 4 can be found in Appendix C.9. Combining Lemma 6 and Theorem 4, we observe that the invertibility is guaranteed if the upper bound for the Lipschitz constant of the attention, eq 11, and the MLP layer, is strictly less than 1. In this case, we can then construct arbitrarily many datasets where two different inputs share the same output, and prompt tuning cannot learn (more subtly: memorize) these datasets with a restricted prompt norm. 87 Experiments 7.1 Experimental Settings In Section 7.2, we use a standard single-layer single-head transformer from Definition 2, to justify the infinite prompt-length limitation. In Section 7.3, we justify the increasing prompt norm on the pretrained LLaMA 7B model [Touvron et al., 2023]. For prompt tuning and LoRA, we use the Huggingface Peft library [Mangrulkar et al., 2022]. On the dataset front, we utilize the RTE subtask of SuperGlue dataset [Wang et al., 2019] and WMT14 En-Fr translation [Bojar et al., 2014]. More details and hyperparameter settings can be found in Appendix A. 7.2 Limited Expressivity of Infinite Length Prompt We first construct the dataset following the proof of Theorem 2 and then show that prompt tuning cannot memorize this simple dataset {(X1 = [x1, x0], Y1 = [y11, y10]), (X2 = [x2, x0], Y2 = [y21, y20])} even with very large prompt lengths. We set the token dimension d = 10. We follow the default pytorch weight initialization and then normalize W1, W2 such that ‚à•W2‚à•2 √ó‚à•W1‚à•2 < 1, following Assumption 2. We randomly sample x0, y10, y20 in a uniform distribution in [0, 1)d and construct the corresponding vectors: x1 and x2 following Theorem 2. To compute MLP‚àí1(y), we follow [Kim et al., 2021] Section 4.1 with 5000 iterations at convergence. We solve Att(x0, [x0, x1]) ‚à• c in Lemma 7 with gradient descent terminating at ‚à†(Att(x0, [x0, x1]), c) < 0.0001. We repeat this setup to obtain 3 different datasets for distinct x0, y10, y20 and denote these with Si, i= 1, 2, 3. We perform prompt tuning, MLP fine-tuning and MLP LoRA training on the constructed datasets for 5 runs and report the mean and standard deviation of per-element Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss y10, y20 at convergence. We show the comparison between prompt-tuning and MLP fine-tuning in Figure 1. As we can observe from the figure, increasing the number of soft prompt tokens post a certain threshold that does not exhibit any reduction in MSE. On the contrary, fine-tuning on the MLP layer tend to easily memorize the training set by reducing the training loss to almost zero (all the three curves for fine-tuning overlap and thus not differentiated). Note that we plot the standard deviation, however it is negligible in the range. Similar to fine-tuning on the MLP layer, LoRA with width 2 on the MLP layer also achieves near-zero training loss which is less than 10‚àí10 on the constructed dataset. We don‚Äôt plot the comparison on Figure 1 as all the six curves are overlapped). This result validates our Theorem 3 that LoRA can memorize a dataset withn examples with trainable parameters O(n) while prompt-tuning may require more. 7.3 Increasing Prompt Spectral Norm during Tuning As discussed in Section 6, a major constraint on the expressive power of prompt tuning is the spectral norm of soft prompts. In Figure 2, we plot the curve for spectral norm of soft prompt as training progresses and the loss reduces on RTE dataset. The curve for WMT14 En-Fr dataset can be found in Appendix B. This trend clearly highlights that in order to counter the limit on the capacity, the spectral norm consistently increases till the training loss saturates. 8 Conclusions In this work, we embark on exploring the capabilities of prompt tuning in the continuous regime, contrasting it with fine-tuning, as an initial endeavor towards a theoretical comprehension. We prove by construction that prompt tuning admits universal approximation within the space of Lipschitz functions. Additionally, we identified inherent limitations of prompt tuning on single-layer trans- formers by constructing theoretically difficult datasets for prompt tuning. These limitations are then extended to multi-layer setting under a specific prompt-norm restriction. From the analysis in Theorem 2 and 3, we note that the limitation of prompt-tuning primarily arises from the correlation across different inputs. Broadly describing, prompt-tuning implements transformation on different inputs via ‚Äúadditional attention values‚Äù, which is more restrictive as compared to the transformations from MLP layers on input tokens. An interesting potential direction to improve prompt-tuning is: ‚Äúdesigning a mechanism to leverage prompting in order to generate 910 100 1000 5000 Length of Soft Prompt 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10Training MSE loss Prompt Tuning on S1 Fine-tuning on S1 Prompt Tuning on S2 Fine-tuning on S2 Prompt Tuning on S3 Fine-tuning on S3 Figure 1: MSE losses at convergence for the 3 constructed datasets (following Theorem 2).

We expect to have some future work focusing on designing novel prompt-tuning strategies along this direction. Limitations While our results provide valuable insights, extending the construction in Theorem 2 to multiple layers and deriving tighter bounds for Lemma 6 are critical steps for a deeper understanding of the limitations of prompt tuning.

For experiments with Llama 7B model, we use batch size 32 and learning rate 0.001. For experiment on WMT14 En-Fr translation, we only compute the loss on the first 100 examples for computational efficiency. We use Adam optimizer and optimal learning rate from grid search at 0.1 for prompt-tuning and at 0.001 for fine-tuning in Section 7.2. In Section 7.3, we use the default loss function in Huggingface implementation for causal language models. We use prompt length m = 10 and the prompt tokens are initialized as the first m tokens in the model vocabulary. B Additional Experiments As mentioned in Section 7.3, the second real world dataset used in our experiment is WMT14 En-Fr translation in order to illustrate that the spectral norm of soft prompts increases during training. We show the curve in Figure B. 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Training Steps 2.350 2.375 2.400 2.425 2.450 2.475 2.500 2.525Prompt Spectral Norm Prompt Spectral Norm 0.65 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90 Validation Loss Validation Loss Figure 3: Increasing prompt spectral norm during tuning on WMT14 En-Fr translation dataset. C Proof of Lemmas and Theorems C.1 Proof of Lemma 1 For the sequence-to-sequence function space FL with functions f : [0 , 1]d√óm ‚Üí [0, 1]d√óm, we can build a sequence-to-sequence function ¬Øg : [0, 1]d√ó(mp+m) ‚Üí [0, 1]d√ó(mp+m) such that for any f ‚àà FL, we can find P ‚àà Rd√ómp, dp(¬Øg([P, ¬∑]):,mp:, f) ‚â§ œµ/2. Proof. we first quantize the input and output sequence space of [0, 1]d√óm into a grid space GŒ¥,m = {0, Œ¥,2Œ¥, ...,1 ‚àí Œ¥}d√óm, which leads to C = ( 1 Œ¥d√óm ) 1 Œ¥d√óm functions considering all input and output mappings in this grid. We index these C functions as ¬ØFL = { ¬Øf1, ¬Øf2, ...,¬ØfC}. For X /‚àà GŒ¥,m, we let ¬Øfi(X) = ¬Øfi(X‚àó) if ki,jŒ¥ <Xi,j, X‚àó i,j ‚â§ (ki,j + 1)Œ¥ and X‚àó ‚àà GŒ¥,m. Then for any f ‚àà FL, we can find a function ¬Øf ‚àà ¬ØFL such that dp( ¬Øf, f) = ( R ‚à• ¬Øf(X) ‚àí f(X)‚à•p pdX)1/p ‚â§ ( R LpmdŒ¥pdX)1/p = L(md) 1 p Œ¥. We choose Œ¥ = Œ¥1 such that L(md) 1 p Œ¥ ‚â§ œµ/2. For the prompt part, we choose mp such that 1 Œ¥d√ómp ‚â• C. Then we can build a set of quan- tized prompts in GŒ¥,mp = {0, Œ¥,2Œ¥, ...,1 ‚àí Œ¥}d√ómp to index these C functions. We denote this set of prompts as {P1, P2, ...,PC}. Finally we can create the quantized function ¬Øg and let 14¬Øg([Pi, X]):,mp: = ¬Øfi(X) and ¬Øg([Pi, X]):,:mp = 0, ‚àÄX ‚àà [0, 1]d√óm, P ‚àà GŒ¥,mp. For P /‚àà GŒ¥,mp, we set ¬Øg([P, X]) = ¬Øg([P‚àó, X]) if ki,jŒ¥ <Pi,j, P‚àó i,j ‚â§ (ki,j + 1)Œ¥ and P‚àó ‚àà GŒ¥,mp. Therefore, with a properly chosen Œ¥ = Œ¥1, for any f ‚àà FL, we can find P ‚àà Rd√ómp such that dP (f, ¬Øg([P, ¬∑]):,mp:) = dp( ¬Øf, f) ‚â§ œµ/2. C.2 Proof of Lemma 2 For any given quantized function ¬Øf : [0, 1]d√óm ‚Üí [0, 1]d√óm with quantization at interval Œ¥, ‚àÉ¬Øh ‚àà ¬ØT 2,1,1 such that ¬Øf = ¬Øh with positional embedding E = Ô£Æ Ô£ØÔ£ØÔ£∞ 0 1 2 ... m ‚àí 1 0 1 2 ... m ‚àí 1 ... ... ... ... ... 0 1 2 ... m ‚àí 1 Ô£π Ô£∫Ô£∫Ô£ª. Proof. The proof is given following Section C in Yun et al. [2019a] appendix. With Section C.1 in Yun et al. [2019a], there exists a functiongq composed of dm Œ¥ token-wise feed-forward layers with hidden layer size r = 1 and ReLU activation to implement this scalar quantization on each input element: gent q (t) = \u001akŒ¥ if kŒ¥ ‚â§ t <(k + 1)Œ¥, k= 0, 1, ..., m/Œ¥‚àí 1 ‚àíŒ¥‚àímd otherwise Then with Section C.2 in Yun et al. [2019a], we can stackm(1/Œ¥)d + 1 attention layers to map all possible input sequences in grid [0 : Œ¥ : 1 ‚àí Œ¥]d √ó [1 : Œ¥ : 2 ‚àí Œ¥]d √ó ... √ó [m ‚àí 1 : Œ¥ : m ‚àí Œ¥]d to distinct numbers which are at least Œ¥ from each other. Finally we only require O(m(1/Œ¥)dm) layers to map these distinct numbers to expected outputs. C.3 Proof of Lemma 3 Lemma 3 is alsmost the same as [Yun et al., 2019a] except that we useœµ/2 instead of œµ/3. C.4 Extension of Theorem 1 to Next-token Predictors As an extension of Theorem 1, we consider approximating a set of sequence-to-sequence functions when we use a transformer layer as a next-token predictor. We consider a set of sequence-to-sequence functions FL with Lipschitz constant L under norm p. f ‚àà FL : [0, 1]d√óm1 ‚Üí [0, 1]d√óm2 accepts an input of length m1 and outputs a sequence of length m2. For any X, X‚Ä≤ ‚àà [0, 1]d√óm1 , we have ‚à•f(X) ‚àí f(X‚Ä≤)‚à•p ‚â§ L‚à•X ‚àí X‚Ä≤‚à•p. Next we show that we can construct a transformer œÑ which can approximate any f ‚àà FL with prompt-tuning when we use it as a next-token predictor. Theorem 5. For anyf ‚àà FL, we can construct a transformerœÑ such that for anyf ‚àà FL, 1 ‚â§ p <‚àû and œµ >0, we can find a prompt P ‚àà [0, 1]d√ómp, such that dp(f, h(P)) ‚â§ œµ, where h(P) = œÑ1([P, ¬∑]):,‚àí1 √ó œÑ2([P, ¬∑]):,‚àí1 √ó ... √ó œÑm2 ([P, ¬∑]):,‚àí1. œÑi is the sequence-to-sequence function implemented with the transformerœÑ when accepting sequences with length mp + m1 + i. Proof. Similar to Theorem 1, we quantize the inputs to grid of [0 : Œ¥ : 1 ‚àí Œ¥] with interval Œ¥ and set mp = ( Œ¥d√óm2 )Œ¥d√óm1 . Œ¥ is chosen such that L(m1d)1/pŒ¥ ‚â§ m‚àí1/p 2 œµ. We index the C = (Œ¥d√óm2 )Œ¥d√óm1 different fs as f1, f2, ..., fC and its sub-function to generate the i-th output token as fj i . The C sequence-to-sequence functions can then be indexed by C distinct prompts. Similar to Lemma 2, we can construct a transformer which can map all possible input sequences in grids [0 : Œ¥ : 1 ‚àí Œ¥] √ó ... √ó [m ‚àí 1 : Œ¥ : m ‚àí Œ¥]d, 0 < m‚â§ m1 + m2 + mp ‚àí 1 to distinct numbers. A final series of MLP layers then map these distinct numbers to desired output vectors where inputs 15in the same grid are mapped to the same output token at each step. Then for any input x ‚àà [0, 1]d√óm1 and any fj, we can find a prompt Pj such that ‚à•œÑ([Pj, x]):,‚àí1 ‚àí fj 0 (x)‚à•p ‚â§ m‚àí1/p 2 œµ ‚à•œÑ([Pj, x, œÑ([P, x]):,‚àí1]:,‚àí1, fj 1 ([x, œÑ([P, x]):,‚àí1])‚à•p ‚â§ m‚àí1/p 2 œµ ... Then we have dp(h(Pj), fj) ‚â§ œµ. C.5 Proof of Lemma 4 If ‚à•W1‚à•2 √ó ‚à•W2‚à•2 < 1 , where ‚à• ¬∑ ‚à•2 is the matrix spectral norm, then the MLP block in Definition 2 is invertible, ie, MLP‚àí1 is a singleton set. Proof. Based on the sufficient conditions for invertibility of a residual block Behrmann et al. [2019], we have that if the feedforward part of a residual blockW2ReLU(W1X:,1 +b1)+ b2 is a contraction with respect to some metric, i.e. its Lipschitz constant < 1, and the metric space on which is defined is complete, then MLP in eq 2 is invertible. Since we are dealing with the euclidean space, any metric induced by the ‚à• ¬∑ ‚à•p norm for p ‚àà [1, ‚àû] ensures the space is complete. The Lipschitz constant ofW2ReLU(W1x+b1)+ b2 is simply ‚à•W1‚à•2 √ó‚à•W2‚à•2. Thus the statement of the lemma follows. C.6 Proof of Theorem 2 For a single layer transformer œÑ defined above with Assumptions 1 and 2, we can build a seq-to-seq dataset {(X1 = [x1, x0], Y1 = [y11, y10]), (X2 = [x2, x0], Y2 = [y21, y20]))}, and we cannot find a prompt P ‚àà Rd√ómp with any mp > 0 such that œÑ([P, Xi]) = Yi holds for any i = 1, 2. The vectors x0, x1, x2 are denoted post positional encodings. Proof. Before proving Theorem 2, we first provide a lemma that will be used in proof and also Theorem 3. Lemma 7. Given any c ‚àà Rd√óm, there are x0 almost anywhere for which we can find another vector x1 ‚àà Rd√óm such that Att(x0, [x0, x1]) ‚à• c with full rank attention weights Wq, Wk, Wv. Proof. If Wvx0 ‚à• c, we can just set x1 = x0, which makes Att(x0, [x0, x1]) ‚à• c hold. If Wvx0 ‚à¶ c, let v = Œ±c ‚àí Wvx0 where Œ± ‚àà R. As Wv is full-rank, we can find x such that x = W‚àí1 v v = Œ±W‚àí1 v c ‚àí x0. Then we will have Att(x0, [x0, x1]) =exp ((Wqx0)‚ä§(Wkx0))Wvx0 + exp ((Wqx0)‚ä§(Wk(Œ±W‚àí1 v c ‚àí x0)))(Œ±c ‚àí Wvx0) exp ((Wqx0)‚ä§(Wkx0)) + exp ((Wqx0)‚ä§(Wk(Œ±W‚àí1v c ‚àí x0))) Therefore, as long as Wqx0 Ã∏‚ä• Wk(W‚àí1 v c), we can change Œ± such that Att(x0, [x0, x1]) = Œ≤Wvx0 + (1‚àí Œ≤)(Œ±c ‚àí Wvx0) where Œ≤ = exp ((Wqx0)‚ä§(Wkx0)) exp ((Wqx0)‚ä§(Wkx0))+exp ((Wqx0)‚ä§(Wk(Œ±W‚àí1 v c‚àíx0))) . When Œ± = 0 , Att(x0, [x0, x1]) = Wvx0, when Œ± ‚Üí ‚àí‚àûor Œ± ‚Üí ‚àû, Att(x0, [x0, x1]) ‚Üí Œ±c ‚àí Wvx0. As Att(x0, [x0, x1]) is continuous w.r.t changing Œ±, there must exist an Œ± such that Att(x0, [x0, x1]) ‚à• c. Pass the two input sequences X1, X2 through the attention layer Att with any prompt P, we can get the last output token as: Att(x0, [P, X1]) =Œª(X1, x0, [P, X1])Att(x0, X1]) + Œª(P, x0, [P, X1])Att(x0, P) (12) Att(x0, [P, X2]) =Œª(X2, x0, [P, X2])Att(x0, X2) + Œª(P, x0, [P, X2])Att(x0, P) (13) 16Here Œª(X1, x2, X3 = [X1, X2]) ‚àà (0, 1) is a positive scalar, defined as Œª(X1, x2, X3) = P j exp((Wkx1j)‚ä§(Wqx2))P j exp((Wkx3j)‚ä§(Wqx2)). xij is the jth token in Xi for notation simplicity. 1. Then from equation 12, Att(x0, P) must be on Cone(‚àíAtt(x0, X1), Att(x0, [P, X1])) and Cone(‚àíAtt(x0, X2), Att(x0, [P, X2])). 2. On the otherhand, as we want to memorize the two examples, we must have Att(x0, [P, X1]) + x0 ‚àà MLP‚àí1(y10) and Att(x0, [P, X2]) + x0 ‚àà MLP‚àí1(y20). We construct the dataset S with arbitrary x0, y10 and y20. Then if dim((MLP‚àí1(y10) ‚àí x0) ‚à™ (MLP‚àí1(y20) ‚àí x0)) + 2 ‚â§ d (Assumption 2), we can find two vectors c1, c2 such that c1, c2 ‚ä• v : v + x0 ‚àà MLP‚àí1(y10) or v + x0 ‚àà MLP‚àí1(y20) and c1 ‚ä• c2. Then we can choose x1, x2 such that Att(x0, X1) ‚à• c1 and Att(x0, X2) ‚à• c2 (Lemma 7). Combine this construction with assumption 1, we have that Cone(‚àíAtt(x0, X1), Att(x0, [P, X1])) and Cone(‚àíAtt(x0, X2), Att(x0, [P, X2])) has no intersection, which means that we cannot find a P to memorize this constructed dataset. C.7 Proof of Lemma 5 For a standard single-layer transformer œÑ defined in Definition 2 with r ‚â• n MLP hidden neurons, for any sequence-to-sequence dataset S satisfying Assumptions 1, we can apply a low-rank update to MLP weights with O(nd) parameters to memorize œÑ(Xi):,m = yim. Proof. We use MLPj(x) to denote the jth output of the MLP layer for an input token x, which is MLPj(x) = xj + b2,j + mX k=1 wk,j max(‚ü®ak, x‚ü© + b1,k, 0) According to our assumption, Att(xim, Xi) are unique vectors for i = 1, 2, ..., n. Then we only need to use the MLP layer to map each xi = Att(xim, Xi) + xim to yim, where we get a new token-wise dataset {(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ...,(xn, yn)} Then we need to find wk, ak and bk such that MLPj(xi) = xi,j + b2,j + mX k=1 wk,j max(‚ü®ak, xi‚ü© + b1,k, 0) = yi,j, i= 1, 2, ..., n, j= 1, 2, ..., d (14) , which is equivalent to constructing a standard MLP to memorize a dataset: nX k=1 wk,j max(‚ü®ak, xi‚ü© + b1,k, 0) = yi,j ‚àí xi,j ‚àí mX k=n+1 wk,j max(‚ü®ak, xi‚ü© + b1,k, 0) ‚àí b2,j (15) Follow Thoerem 1 in Yun et al. [2019b], we can construct a, b1, ..., bn such that for x1, x2, ...,xn, we have zi = ‚ü®a, xi‚ü©, b1 < z1 < b2 < ... < bn < zn. Then we can find w1, ..., wn which solves equation 15. For d-dimension output, we need to find W ‚àà Rn√ód and a ‚àà Rd and b ‚àà Rn. With LoRA, we need a low-rank update of size m √ó n + n √ó d for W2, a low-rank update of size d √ón + n √óm for W1 and an update of size n for b1, which is O(n √ód) in total. Normally we have m ‚âÉ d, then we need an update with parameter size around (4n + 1)d to memorize the last token of n training examples. C.8 Proof of Theorem 3 For any single layer transformer œÑ defined in Definition 2, there exists a seq-to-seq dataset {(X1 = [x10, x1], [y10, y11]), (X2 = [x20, x2], [y20, y21]), ...,(Xn = [xn0, xn], [yn0, yn1])} that satisfies Assumption 1 with n < dtraining examples such that we need at least n prompt tokens in P to memorize the training set, ie, for œÑ([P, Xi]):,‚àí1 = yi1 to hold for all i = 1, 2, ..., n. 17Proof. Without loss of generality, we assumeW2 has no zero elements, otherwise we can just ignore this hidden neuron in MLP layer. Rd has d bases {tj : j = 1, 2, ..., d}, then MLP‚àí1(yi1) must be bounded on either positive or negative part of these d directions, which means there exists B ‚â• 0 such that v‚ä§tj ‚à•tj‚à• ‚â§ B, ‚àÄv ‚àà MLP‚àí1(yi1), j= 1, 2, ..., d Otherwise ‚àÄB > 0 , ‚àÉtj, we can find a v ‚àà MLP‚àí1(yi) that v‚ä§tj ‚à•tj‚à• ‚â• B. Meanwhile we have MLP(v) = v+b2+W2ReLU(W1v+b1). As ‚à•v‚à• can be arbitrarily large, ifW1v = 0, ‚à•MLP(v)‚à• ‚Üí ‚àû if ‚à•v‚à• ‚Üí ‚àû. if W1v Ã∏= 0, ‚à•MLP(v)‚à• can also be arbitrarily large when increasing the norm of v due to the non-linearity of ReLU(W1v + b1). Then we can find a set of n linearly independent vectors {c1, c2, ...,cn} such that {ai : ai ‚àí ci ‚ä• ci, ai ‚àà MLP‚àí1(yi1)} = ‚àÖ by enlarging the norm of ci. With the n ci vectors, we can begin to construct our dataset: We set xi = ci, i = 1 , 2, ..., nand find xi0 such that ci ‚ä• Att(xi, Xi) (Lemma 7) and Att(xi, Xi) are distinct for i = 1 , 2, ..., n(Assumption 1), which makes {a1 ‚àí x1 ‚àí Œª(X1, x1, [P, X1])Att(x1, X1), ...,an ‚àí xn ‚àí Œª(Xn, xn, [P, Xn])Att(xn, Xn)} linearly indepen- dent for any ai ‚àà MLP‚àí1(yi1). Here Œª(¬∑, ¬∑, ¬∑) is the same as defined in Section C.6. Moreover, we have Att(xi, [P, Xi]) = Œª(Xi, P, [P, Xi])Att(xi, P) + Œª(Xi, xi, [P, Xi])Att(xi, Xi) (16) ‚àà MLP‚àí1(yi1) ‚àí xi Then Att(xi, P), i= 1, 2, ..., nmust be n linearly independent vectors, which requires rank(WvPA) = n, (17) where A ‚àà Rmp√ón is the attention score matrix between xi and P. P ‚àà Rd√ómp is the prompt token sequence and Wv is the attention value weight. Therefore, we must have mp ‚â• n. C.9 Proof of Theorem 4 A transformer T is invertible if: 1. The Lipschitz constant of the attention block in each layer œÑl is strictly less than 1 2. The Lipschitz constant of the 2-layer ReLU block in each layer œÑl, which is bounded by ‚à•Wl 2‚à•2 √ó ‚à•Wl 1‚à•2, is strictly less than 1 Proof. This proof is based on the proof provided for lemma 4, thus we restrict ourselves to the sketch: Based on the sufficient condition for invertibility in Behrmann et al. [2019], condition (1) implies that the attention block (eq 1) with the residual connection, ie X + Att(X, X) , is an invertible function. Similarly, condition (2) implies that the MLP block which constitutes of the 2-layer ReLU block with the residual connection (eq 2) also exhibit invertibility. Thus each transformer layer œÑl (eq 3) is invertible by noting that its a composition of two invertible functions. The same property ensures that the entire transformer architecture T is also invertible. C.10 Proof of Lemma 6 Under the compactness condition, the Lipschitz constant of the i-th attention head in the l-th transformer layer, denoted for simplicity as Atti,l, admits the following bound w.r.t the entire input sequence of length m: Lip(Atti,l(¬∑, ¬∑)) ‚â§ (1 + 8‚àöm(Dl)2‚à•(Wi,l k )T Wi,l q ‚à•2)‚à•Wi,l v ‚à•2, (18) and the Lipschitz constant of the entire attention block in layer l, denoted as Attl, admits the bound: Lip(Attl(¬∑, ¬∑)) ‚â§ vuut hX i=1 (‚à•Wi,l o ‚à•2 √ó Lip(Atti,l))2. (19) 18Proof. We drop the superscripts i, lin the proof to avoid notation clutter. Similarly, we denote the concatenation of the prompt matrix P and the original input matrix X, simply with X. Derivation for single head eq 18: Consider two matrices X1, X2 ‚àà X= {X ‚àà Rd√óm; ‚à•X‚à•2 ‚â§ D} . Denote with A1, A2 the corresponding attention matrices respectively, which can be defined as: A1 = œÉ((WkX1)‚ä§WqX1) A2 = œÉ((WkX2)‚ä§WqX2) (20) The output of the attention head, denoted with Att(¬∑) admits the following: ‚à•Att(X1)‚àíAtt(X2)‚à•2 = ‚à•WvX1A1 ‚àí WvX2A2‚à•2 (21) a ‚â§ ‚à•X1A1 ‚àí X2A2‚à•2‚à•Wv‚à•2 (22) = ‚à•X1A1 ‚àí X2A1 + X2A1 ‚àí X2A2‚à•2‚à•Wv‚à•2 (23) ‚â§ (‚à•A1‚à•2‚à•X1 ‚àí X2‚à•2 + ‚à•X2‚à•2‚à•A1 ‚àí A2‚à•2)‚à•Wv‚à•2 (24) b ‚â§ (‚à•X1 ‚àí X2‚à•2 + ‚à•A1 ‚àí A2‚à•2D)‚à•Wv‚à•2 (25) where (a) holds from the spectral norm properties and in (b) we use the bounded input spectral norm assumptions. We now focus on the second term ‚à•A1 ‚àí A2‚à•2 in eq 25 . From the bound in lemma 9, we have: ‚à•A1 ‚àí A2‚à•2 ‚â§ 2‚àöm‚à•G‚à•2 (26) where G is the diagonal matrix with entires described in lemma 8 We can now invoke lemma 10 to obtain the following : ‚à•A1 ‚àí A2‚à•2 ‚â§ 2‚àöm √ó 2 √ó 2‚à•WT k Wq‚à•2D √ó ‚à•X1 ‚àí X2‚à•2 (27) Combining the previous inequality with eq 25, we have the following bound: ‚à•Att(X1)‚àíAtt(X2)‚à•2 ‚â§ (1 + 8‚àöm‚à•WT k Wq‚à•2D2)‚à•Wv‚à•2‚à•X1 ‚àí X2‚à•2 (28) Derivation for the entire block eq 11: The proof follows simply by leveraging the following property: Property: for a matrix C = [A, B], the spectral norm of C admits the bound: ‚à•C‚à•2 ‚â§ q ‚à•A‚à•2 2 + ‚à•B‚à•2 2 We then simply combine the definition of the attention block and the lipschitz constant bound in eq 18 with the above property in order to obtain the desired bound. Lemma 8 (Dong et al. [2021] Lemma A.1) . For the column stochastic matrix A1 obtained by performing column-wise softmax of some matrix Z1 (where in our setting Z1 = (WkX1)‚ä§WqX1, and another row stochastic matrix A2 obtained by performing column-wise softmax of some matrix Z2, where Z2 = Z1 ‚àí E (for some E, which need notbelong to X), we have the following bound: A2(I ‚àí G) ‚â§ A1 ‚â§ A2(I + 2G) (29) where the inequality is elementwise and G is a diagonal matrix with entries as Gii = maxj,j‚Ä≤ |Œ¥T i E(Œ¥T j ‚àí Œ¥T j‚Ä≤)|. Here Œ¥k is a one-hot vector with the entry 1 in the kth dimension. Lemma 9. Following the notations of lemma 8, we have the following spectral norm bound: ‚à•A1 ‚àí A2‚à•2 ‚â§ 2‚àöm‚à•G‚à•2 (30) Proof. We begin by noting the following entry-wise inequality from eq 29: A2G ‚â§ A1 ‚àí A2 ‚â§ 2A2G (31) 19which ensures that ‚à•A1 ‚àí A2‚à•F ‚â§ 2‚à•A2G‚à•F . We also have the following using matrix norm equivalence: ‚à•A1 ‚àí A2‚à•2 ‚â§ ‚à•A1 ‚àí A2‚à•F (32) Invoking the matrix norm equivalence again, we have that 2‚à•A2G‚à•F ‚â§ 2 p rank(A2G)‚à•A2G‚à•2 (33) where rank(¬∑) is the matrix rank. Combining the inequalities, we attain the bound : ‚à•A1 ‚àí A2‚à•2 ‚â§ 2‚àöm‚à•A2‚à•2‚à•G‚à•2 (34) since A2 is column-stochastic , ‚à•A2‚à•2 = 1 Lemma 10. The term G in lemma 9 admits the following spectral norm bound: ‚à•G‚à•2 ‚â§ 2D‚à•WqWT k ‚à•2‚à•X1 ‚àí X2‚à•2 (35) here D is the previously stated spectral norm bound of the inputs Xl ‚àà Xl. Proof. We begin by noting that since G is a square diagonal matrix with non-negative real values, the singular values of G are the corresponding diagonal elements. We thus have that ‚à•G‚à•max = ‚à•G‚à•2 , where ‚à• ¬∑ ‚à•max is the max norm. Since G admits the form described in lemma 8, it is trivial to note that: ‚à•G‚à•max = max i,j,i‚Ä≤,j‚Ä≤ |Ei,j ‚àí Ei‚Ä≤,j‚Ä≤| (36) ‚â§ 2‚à•E‚à•max ‚â§ 2‚à•E‚à•2 (37) where the second inequality follows from the matrix norm equivalence. Now, we can bound the last term ‚à•E‚à•2 by noting that the inputs X belong to a bounded set. This allows us to provide the following bounds: ‚à•E‚à•2 = ‚à•(WkX1)‚ä§WqX1 ‚àí (WkX2)‚ä§WqX2‚à•2 (38) = ‚à•(WkX1)‚ä§WqX1 ‚àí (WkX1)‚ä§WqX2 + (WkX1)‚ä§WqX2 ‚àí (WkX2)‚ä§WqX2‚à•2 (39) ‚â§ (‚à•X1‚à•2‚à•WT k Wq‚à•2 + ‚à•X2‚à•2‚à•WT k Wq‚à•2)‚à•X1 ‚àí X2‚à•2 (40) ‚â§ 2D‚à•WT k Wq‚à•2‚à•X1 ‚àí X2‚à•2 (41) C.11 Extension of Lemma 6 Lemma 6 and theorem 4 operate over functions from P1 √ó X1 ‚Üí PL+1 √ó XL+1. We can relax the requirement of the prompt and provide the Lipschitz constant upper bound in consideration to functions of the form X1 ‚Üí XL+1 by using the following assumption: Assumption 3. Assume for simplicity that ‚à•Pl 1 ‚àí Pl 2‚à•2 ‚â§ Œ±l‚à•Xl 1 ‚àí Xl 2‚à•2; ‚àÄl ‚â• 1. Œ±l = 0 when l = 1. Note: A recursive expression for Œ±l in the above assumption can be provided, but the expression does not admit a simplified form and we thus omit it here. We will use Dl X , akin to eq 9, to denote the compactness corresponding to the input matrix across the layers. Based on this assumption, we have the following Lipschitz constant upper bound: Lemma 11. The Lipschitz constant of the single head Atti,l admits the following bound w.r.t the input part, X1 of length mX, of the input sequence: Lip(Atti,l(¬∑, ¬∑)) ‚â§ \u0012q 1 + (Œ±l)2 + 8‚àömX(Dl X)2(1 + (Œ±l)2)‚à•(Wi,l k )T Wi,l q ‚à•2 \u0013 ‚à•Wi,l v ‚à•2 (42) For l = 1, Œ±l = 0 in the above bound. The Lipschitz constant of the entire attention block in layer l follows similarly. 20Proof. For some first layer input X1 1 and prompt P, let us denote the direct output of the attention head in the l-th layer with ‚àí ‚ÜíXl 1. We have the following update rule for ‚àí ‚ÜíXl 1: ‚àí ‚ÜíXl 1 = Wi,l v [Pl 1, Xl 1] ¬∑ œÉ((Wi,l k [Pl 1, Xl 1])‚ä§Wi qXl 1) = Wi,l v [Pl 1, Xl 1] ¬∑ Al 1 (43) Here, Pl 1 is the updated prompt matrix w.r.t the input. For two different inputs X1 1 and X1 2 at the first layer, P1 1 = P1 2 = P, since the prompt is same across all inputs. Al 1 is then simply the corresponding column-stochastic matrix. With the context clear, we now drop the superscriptsi, l, as done previously. For ‚à•‚àí ‚ÜíX1 ‚àí ‚àí ‚ÜíX2‚à•2, we have: ‚à•‚àí ‚ÜíX1 ‚àí ‚àí ‚ÜíX2‚à•2 ‚â§ ‚à•[P1, X1]A1 ‚àí [P2, X2]A2‚à•2‚à•Wv‚à•2 ‚â§ \u0012 ‚à•A1‚à•2 q ‚à•P1 ‚àí P2‚à•2 2 + ‚à•X1 ‚àí X2‚à•2 2 + q ‚à•P2‚à•2 2 + ‚à•X2‚à•2 2‚à•A1 ‚àí A2‚à•2 \u0013 ‚à•Wv‚à•2 (44) where the second inequality is attained using the property of spectral norm of concatenated matrices. We now consider the term ‚à•A1 ‚àí A2‚à•2. By invoking lemmas 9 and 10, we have that: ‚à•A1 ‚àí A2‚à•2 ‚â§ 2‚àömX √ó 2‚à•E‚à•2 where E = (Wk[P1, X1])‚ä§WqX1 ‚àí (Wk[P2, X2])‚ä§WqX2 (45) Invoking assumption 3 , ‚à•E‚à•2 can further be bounded as: ‚à•E‚à•2 ‚â§ 2DX p 1 + Œ±2‚à•(Wk)T Wq‚à•2 (46) Finally, by combining the bound for ‚à•E‚à•2 and assumption 3 with eq 44, we obtain: ‚à•‚àí ‚ÜíX1 ‚àí ‚àí ‚ÜíX2‚à•2 (47) ‚â§ \u0010p 1 + Œ±2 + DX p 1 + Œ±2 √ó 8‚àömXDX p 1 + Œ±2‚à•(Wk)T Wq‚à•2 \u0011 ‚à•Wv‚à•2‚à•X1 ‚àí X2‚à•2 (48) which provides us the desired bound. By setting Œ±l = 0, the case when there is no prompt, we obtain a similar bound as lemma 6 21",

However, the transferability of these prompts, especially continuous prompts, between different models remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a zero-shot continuous prompt transfer method, where source prompts are encoded into a relative space and the corresponding target prompts are searched for transferring to target mod- els. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method, showing that ‚Äútask semantics‚Äù in continuous prompts can be generalized across various lan- guage models. Moreover, we find that combining ‚Äútask semantics‚Äù from multiple source models can further enhance the performance of transfer.1 1 I NTRODUCTION Recently, natural language processing (NLP) has witnessed a paradigm shift from the finetuning of full language models to the optimization of a small subset of prompt tokens (Shin et al., 2020; Lester et al., 2021; Li & Liang, 2021; Zhong et al., 2021). As language models have dramatically increased in size and may contain billions of parameters (Brown et al., 2020), the strategy of freezing language models while optimizing the learnable prompt parameters becomes the most affordable and efficient alternative for downstream tasks. This technique, referred to as prompt tuning, has gained substantial recognition for its effectiveness across a range of language models (Shin et al., 2020; Lester et al., 2021; Li & Liang, 2021; Zhong et al., 2021). Various prompt tuning methods have been explored, which can be generally categorized into discrete and continuous cases. Discrete prompt tuning, such as AutoPrompt (Shin et al., 2020), primarily fo- cuses on the selection and optimization of a predetermined set of tokens within a language model‚Äôs vocabulary. By contrast, continuous prompt tuning (Zhong et al., 2021) allows the modification of continuous prompt embeddings by gradient descent. The latter typically offers better performance on downstream tasks due to its greater flexibility in the prompt space. However, existing prompt tuning often requires accessing the model‚Äôs internal states, as the gradient needs to be backpropa- gated to the first layer of token embeddings (Shin et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2021), which contradicts the goal of avoiding gradient computation for large language models. Therefore, it would be ideal if we can perform prompt tuning on a small model (which is compu- tationally inexpensive) and transfer the prompt to large models. We thus question: How transfer- able are these prompts between different language models? Prior research on transferring prompts mainly focuses on discrete prompts (Rakotonirina et al., 2023). Such transfer is often straightfor- ward, as discrete prompt tokens usually carry semantic meanings by their nature and can be directly accepted by different language models. For continuous prompts, however, prompt transfer becomes less straightforward because they are unexplainable and sparsely distributed in a high-dimensional space (Khashabi et al., 2022; Su et al., 2022). Moreover, different models might learn the embedding 1Our code is available at https://github.com/MANGA-UOFA/PTfer 1 arXiv:2310.01691v2  [cs.CL]  12 Jul 2024Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 space differently, due to their designs, sizes, training paradigms, as well as parameter random initial- izations. Therefore, transferring a continuous prompt tailored for one model to another, especially with different dimensions, remains a challenge. Attempts to bridge this gap have centered around introducing a neural projector that aligns continu- ous prompts across different models. However, the learned projectors are specific to unique model pairs. More importantly, it introduces extra computational cost because the training requires task supervision on the target model and the source prompt embeddings, or even the need to utilize the parallel prompt embeddings for both models (Su et al., 2022). These approaches cannot be applied in a zero-shot transfer scenario, and are undesired in real applications. In this work, we propose a novel approach to zero-shot continuous prompt transfer without the need for task supervision or additional training of neural projectors. We introduce an encode-then-search strategy, where we encode the source prompts into a relative space (Norelli et al., 2022; Moschella et al., 2023) and then search for the corresponding target prompt embeddings. Our intuition is that the induced continuous prompt contains implicit information for a task (Vu et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022), referred to as ‚Äútask semantics‚Äù, which may be carried over from the source embedding space to the target. We suggest that, although direct transfer of prompt embeddings is problematic because different language models have their own embedding spaces, the position of the continuous prompt embedding relative to the embeddings of known words is more likely to share the same structure in different language models, inspired by the evidence of representation learning literature in other domains, such as word embeddings (Faruqui & Dyer, 2014; Lazaridou et al., 2015; Artetxe et al., 2018), synthetic structure discovery (Wu et al., 2023), unsupervised neural translation (Lample et al., 2018), and cognitive science (Levakov et al., 2021; Chersoni et al., 2021). In our approach, the transfer of prompts only requires a shared vocabulary of common tokens, which serve as the anchors of the relative embedding space. For the target model, we search for its prompt embeddings that preserve the same relative structure as that of the source language model. Our experiments confirm that, with our proposed zero-shot approach, continuous prompts are trans- ferable to different language models, largely outperforming baseline approaches such as training neural projectors. We also discover that utilizing continuous prompts from multiple distinct source models enhances the generalizability on target models. This is because the semantics of the prompts induced from a single source might be model-specific, whereas the multi-source method provides a more robust view of the task semantics, therefore achieving higher performance of prompt transfer. In short, our contributions are summarized as follows: ‚Ä¢ We address a novel setting of zero-shot continuous prompt transfer, which allows for the reuse of continuous prompts across different language models. ‚Ä¢ We propose an encode-then-search strategy that maps a continuous prompt into a relative space for transfer between language models. Our approach facilitates multi-source transfer, which cannot be easily done by previous work. ‚Ä¢ We provide detailed experimental analysis on a factual-probing suite of 41 types of ques- tions to show the effectiveness of our approach. 2 M ETHODOLOGY In this section, we begin with an overview of continuous prompt tuning in ¬ß2.1. We then introduce our encoding (¬ß2.2) and decoding (¬ß2.3) methods for transferring continuous prompt embeddings between language models. Finally in ¬ß2.4, we discuss our multi-source transfer approach for im- proving the performance of transfer. 2.1 C ONTINUOUS PROMPT TUNING Continuous prompt tuning (Zhong et al., 2021) optimizes the embeddings of a prompt in the con- tinuous space for a downstream task, which essentially introduces virtual tokens to the language model. During this process, the continuous prompt, which is a set of learnable embedding vec- tors, can capture the implicit information for the task of interest (Vu et al., 2022). Different from full-model finetuning methods (Zhou & Srikumar, 2022), the gradient from the final loss function backpropagates through the model but only updates the initial embedding layers. 2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 Source LM Target LM [ X ][ MASK ] [ X ][ MASK ] (a) Source anchors Target anchors Induced source prompts Target prompts Relative SpaceTarget Space Source Space (b) Figure 1: (a) The goal of transferring the induced continuous prompts on a source model to a target model. (b) Our proposed method for this transfer in a zero-shot manner, where the target prompts should be aligned with the induced source prompts in the relative space. Consider prompting a language model for some task. A continuous prompt has the following format: Prompt(x) = x v1 v2 ¬∑¬∑¬∑ vm (1) where x is an input data sample, and m is a pre-defined prompt length, i.e., the number of learnable vectors. The configuration of vi as either a prefix or postfix tox is an aspect of prompt design. In our implementation, we append these tokens as a postfix to x. For each virtual token vi, its embedding is a learnable vector vi ‚àà Rd that has the same dimension d as the embedding layer of the language model. The soft prompt tuning objective is to maximize the likelihood of the outputy of the training sample, given by the source model Ps(¬∑) as arg max v1,¬∑¬∑¬∑,vm X (x,y)‚ààD log P(y | v1, ¬∑¬∑¬∑ , vm, x) (2) After the continuous prompts v1, . . . ,vm are optimized, they are usually used to make inference on the same model for the same task (Lester et al., 2021; Li & Liang, 2021; Zhong et al., 2021). Prompt tuning is more efficient than full-model finetuning because only a small number of param- eters, i.e., the embeddings of the virtual tokens, are updated for a downstream task. Meanwhile, it maintains substantial flexibility and achieves similar performance to full-model finetuning (Lester et al., 2021). However, learning these virtual tokens may still be expensive for large language mod- els because we need to perform backpropagation through the entire model structure. Our goal is to explore the feasibility of learning a continuous prompt with a small language model and transferring it to larger ones, therefore avoiding excessive gradient computations of prompt tuning for different large language models. 2.2 E NCODING TO A RELATIVE SPACE We propose to transfer continuous prompts from a source language model to target models. The process involves two key phases: (1) encoding the source prompt embeddings into a relative repre- sentation and (2) searching for target prompt embeddings whose corresponding relative representa- tion aligns with those of the source. This two-phase method facilitates the effective transfer of task semantics between different embedding spaces, allowing the transferred prompts to accomplish the task on the target model. The concept of relative representation involves encoding a data point based on its similarities to certain reference points, known as anchors (Norelli et al., 2022; Moschella et al., 2023). In our work, the relative space, where these encoded representations reside, serves as a shared semantic space across different models and facilitates the transfer process of continuous prompts. Consider a continuous prompt v1, v2, ¬∑¬∑¬∑ , vm ‚àà Rds , where ds indicates the embedding dimension of the source language model. We aim to transform it into a relative representation. This can be shown in Figure 1b as transferring orange stars to orange triangles. To encode the relative embeddings of the prompt, we need a set of common tokens, serving as anchors, that are shared between both source and target language models. We simply choose the 3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 shared tokens as the set of anchors, as they provide a common ground for expressing a prompt in relative terms, regardless of differently learned embedding spaces. Specifically, the anchors‚Äô embeddings in the source model can be represented by a matrix As = [as 1, as 2, ¬∑¬∑¬∑ , as k] ‚àà Rds√ók, where k is the number of anchors, and [, ] concatenates column vectors into a matrix. We then encode a prompt embedding vi in a relative space with respect to these anchors, where we compute the cosine similarity between a prompt embedding and each anchor‚Äôs embedding, given by rAs (vi) = (cos(vi, as 1), ¬∑¬∑¬∑ , cos(vi, as k))‚ä§ (3) This encoding step translates a continuous prompt from the source language model into a language using the relationship among common tokens so that other models can potentially understand. It bridges the source and target language models and passes implicit task information contained in the source continuous prompt. 2.3 S EARCH IN THE TARGET SPACE We search a continuous prompt for the target language model, based on the intuition that the relative embeddings are model-agnostic and can be aligned across different language models, i.e., the orange and green triangles in Figure 1 should have the same structure. In this way, we can search the (absolute) target prompt embeddings by maximizing the alignment of the source and target relative spaces. Concretely, the target embeddings vt 1, vt 2, ¬∑¬∑¬∑ , vt m ‚àà Rdt are randomly initialized, where dt is the target embedding dimension and may not be the same as ds. They are represented by green stars in Figure 1b. These target embeddings are then encoded using the target anchor embeddings At = [at 1, at 2, ¬∑¬∑¬∑ , at k] ‚àà Rdt√ók, shown by green squares in Figure 1b. These target anchors are the same as source anchors, and their embeddings are given by the target language model. Similar to encoding the source prompt, the target embeddings can be represented in the relative space by rAt (vt i) = (cos(vt i, at 1), ¬∑¬∑¬∑ , cos(vt i, at k))‚ä§ (4) To align source and target relative embeddings, i.e., Eqns. (3) and (4), we seek a target embedding vt i that maximizes their similarity. The objective is maximize vt i cos(rAs (vi), rAt (vt i)). (5) which can be accomplished by gradient descent. This procedure is repeated for i = 1, ¬∑¬∑¬∑ , mto obtain all the embeddings of a length-m prompt for the target language model. It is noted that such searched prompt embeddings may not have the same scale as the target language model‚Äôs word embeddings, partially because the cos measure used in (3) and (4) is insensitive to vector magnitude. Therefore, we normalize them as evt i = vt i ‚àí ¬µv œÉv ¬∑ œÉ + ¬µ (6) with ¬µv, œÉv ‚àà R being the mean and standard deviation of all searched prompt embedding values, and ¬µ, œÉ‚àà R being those of pretrained word embeddings of the target model. The transferred continuous prompt, after the normalization, is directly used to query the target model Pt(¬∑) for inference, given by Pt(y | evt 1, ¬∑¬∑¬∑ , evt m, x). 2.4 M ULTI -SOURCE TRANSFER We argue that the induced prompt embeddings from a single model might be model-specific, which is supported by the evidence in Khashabi et al. (2022) that a language model can generate numerous continuous prompts capable of performing the same task. Such flexibility is believed to arise from the high expressiveness of the model‚Äôs lower layers (Telgarsky, 2016; Raghu et al., 2017). There- fore, the induced continuous prompt from a specific model may be one of the many plausible ones, carrying model-specific information in addition to task semantics and limiting the transferability to other language models. 4Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 To enhance the generalization of the induced continuous prompt, we propose a multi-source transfer approach. Specifically, we search for the target embeddings vt whose encoded embeddings rAt (vt) align closely with the encoded embeddings rAsi (vsi ) from multiple source models si in the relative space. In other words, the goal is to search for vt such that the sum of similarities between rAt (vt) and each source prompt rAsi (vsi ) is maximized. Given S-many source models, the objective of searching a target embedding vt i is: maximize vt i SX j=1 cos(rAsj (vsj i ), rAt (vt i)). (7) We follow Eqn. (6) to normalizevt i to target model‚Äôs embedding space, and use the resulting vectors evt i for inference. 3 E XPERIMENTS 3.1 D ATASET We utilized a widely used factual probing dataset, LAMA (Petroni et al., 2019), to evaluate the effectiveness of our continuous prompt transfer approach. We followed recent factual probing stud- ies (Shin et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2021) that focus on the TREx split of LAMA. Specifically, LAMA-TREx presents a factual knowledge piece as a triple‚ü®subject, relation, object‚ü©. For example, the fact that ‚ÄúDante was born in Florence‚Äù is represented as ‚ü®Dante, place of birth, Florence‚ü©, where ‚Äúplace of birth‚Äù is a pre-defined relation in the dataset. In total, there are 41 distinct relations as subtasks, each of which contains up to 1, 000 tuples. We chose factual probing for two key reasons: First, induced prompts represent different task semantics from 41 sub-tasks (distinct pre-defined re- lations), providing a robust way to evaluate the generalizability of our transfer approach in various scenarios. Second, the factual probing task requires the model to precisely predict the correct entities from its vocabulary. This makes it easier to judge the performance of a prompt. On the source pretrained language model, we adopted OptiPrompt (Zhong et al., 2021) for inducing a continuous prompt for each of the 41 sub-tasks. Given a sub-task of a certain relation, the source language model is queried using the prompt defined in Eqn. (1), where the prompt embeddings are randomly initialized and then optimized according to Eqn. (2). 3.2 C HOICE OF MODELS AND OTHER IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS We investigated our transferring approach across a range of language models, namely, BERT (De- vlin et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), and ALBERT (Lan et al., 2020), including base and large variants. It should be noted that ALBERT utilizes parameter sharing across layers and reduced embedding dimensions, which, to some extent, ties the semantics of embeddings and hidden lay- ers. Therefore, we only used BERT and RoBERTa as the source language models while excluding ALBERTA due to its unique architecture that does not support full compatibility with BERT and RoBERTa. All these models are considered as target models for transfer. In the main experiments, we set the default number of prompt embeddings m to 5, and the number of anchors k to 8192. We report the standard evaluation metric, micro-average accuracy, which is calculated by averaging the accuracy of 41 sub-tasks of distinct relations in the LAMA dataset (Shin et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2021). These settings are applied to both our approach and baselines. More implementation details are shown in Appendix A.1. 3.3 M AIN RESULTS Direct transfer.We first analyze a na¬®ƒ±ve method, direct transfer, which directly applies the source- induced continuous prompt to the target model. This provides us with a general understanding of whether continuous prompts are directly transferable. We show the results of direct transfer in Table 1 as a standalone experiment, as it does not fit our main table because direct transfer is only feasible when the source and target embedding dimensions match. 5Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 Table 1: Accuracy of direct transfer between models with the same embedding dimension. Results are in percentage. Source Target dembedding Transfer acc (%) BERTbase RoBERTabase 768 0.11 RoBERTabase BERTbase 768 0.12 BERTlarge RoBERTalarge 1024 6.27 RoBERTalarge BERTlarge 1024 0.49 The results reveal that continuous prompts induced from the base mod- els of BERT and RoBERTa (both with 768 dimensions) perform poorly when transferred to each other (around 0.1% accuracy). For their large variants, the transfer performance from RoBERTa to BERT improves marginally, achiev- ing around 0.5% accuracy. Transfer- ring from BERT to RoBERTa achieves nearly6.3% accuracy, but is still far from ideal. Overall, this experiment verifies that continuous prompts are not directly transferable, signifying the importance of prompt transfer research. Baselines and single-source transfer.Table 2 represents the results of non-transfer baselines for reference. In the random method, prompt embeddings are randomly sampled from a normal dis- tribution fitted to the target models‚Äô word embeddings. Its all-zero performance implies that factual probing is a challenging task that requires non-trivial efforts from a machine learning model. In direct tuning, the continuous prompt is directly tuned with the target model. As expected, direct tuning achieves high performance, but is undesired as it requires backpropagation through the target model; it serves as an ‚Äúupper bound‚Äù of prompt transfer in the factual probing task. We also present the performance of manual prompts, provided by the LAMA dataset (Petroni et al., 2019), serving as another reference score for evaluating prompt transfer methods. Table 3 shows the main results of our proposed method along with several continuous prompt trans- fer baselines. We experimented with a straightforward method, called discretization (Khashabi et al., 2022), for continuous prompt transfer. Specifically, each prompt embedding is projected to its nearest-neighbor token embedding, and these discrete tokens are transferred to the target model. As analyzed in Khashabi et al. (2022), such a method yields poor transferability, probably due to the Table 2: Results of the non-transfer baselines, serving as reference scores for transfer.

Our results also demonstrate the low performance of discretization, which is consistent with previous work and indicates that a more nuanced approach is needed for effective prompt transfer. In addition, we included an intuitive baseline method, the neural projector(Su et al., 2022), for comparison. Specifically, we first trained a two-layer projector to map the source embedding space to the target one based on anchor words. Then, we projected the source-induced prompt embed- dings to the target model using the trained projector. Detailed settings and results are provided in Appendix A.2. As seen, transferring the induced prompt embeddings through the projector provides better results but still falls short of manual prompting. Now, we consider our proposed prompt transfer method with a single source. As seen, our method yields consistent improvement compared with the neural projector, which is a compelling result as our method does not require learning a mapping from the source embedding space to the target. This verifies that our proposal of working with a relative space is more effective than the original embedding space for continuous prompt transfer. More profoundly, the prompts transferred from the base models of BERT and RoBERTa surpass the manual prompting baseline, manifesting the practical value of our proposed prompt transfer method. Multi-source transfer. Finally, we evaluate our proposed multi-source prompt transfer method as described in Section 2.4. We consider two dual-source settings: BERT base+BERTlarge and BERTbase+RoBERTabase. The results are also shown in Table 3. As seen, using multiple sources generally improves transferability. For example, the BERTbase+BERTlarge dual-source setting outper- forms BERTbase by 2‚Äì10 percentage points, although BERTlarge alone is not a strong source model. Compared with the best single source, the BERT base+RoBERTabase dual-source setting yields an improvement of 1‚Äì2 points on the target models of ALBERTbase and ALBERTlarge, which are not in- volved in the prompt tuning process. Overall, this experiment verifies that multiple sources improve the transferability of continuous prompts. Transferability and expressive power.We observed in Table 3 that a larger source model (ei- ther BERTlarge or RoBERTalarge) has lower transfer performance. This aligns with the intuition in Khashabi et al. (2022) that there could be a large number of similarly performing continuous prompts, residing in a large (and also deep) model‚Äôs expressive embedding space (Telgarsky, 2016; Raghu et al., 2017). Therefore, the induced prompt may carry model specificity in addition to task semantics, limiting its transferability to other models. Fortunately, the low transferability of large source models does not affect the value of our work, because our typical application scenario is to tune a continuous prompt on a small source model and use it for a large model. This is precisely the setting where our approach is especially effective. 3.4 A NALYSIS Matching in relative space vs. transferability.Our approach is based on the intuition that the task semantic is carried in a relative space, which can be aligned for different language models. We analyze whether a closer matching of the relative space yields a higher transferability of the continuous prompts. In Figure 2, we show the trend of validation accuracy versus matching loss along the search process in Eqn. (5), where for each source‚Äìtarget combination, we averaged the performance of all sub-tasks. 7Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 Figure 3: The effect of normalization. Figure 4: The effect of the anchor number and prompt length. Each value (dot) was computed by averaging the accuracy from all source‚Äìtarget combinations. In Figure 2, we observe that, as the matching loss decreases (towards right in the plots), the validation accuracy of target models increases. In the special case where source and target models are identical, the matching loss of the relative space is able to approach zero, and the accuracy of the transferred prompt is close to that of the source prompt. This demonstrates that our approach is able to recover the original embeddings from the relative space, even if a normalization is performed to the target embeddings in Eqn. (6). When source and target models are different, the matching loss does not approach zero, which is reasonable because the different language models‚Äô embedding spaces may not be perfectly aligned. Nevertheless, the correlation between matching loss and validation accuracy is highly consistent across all source‚Äìtarget combinations, convincingly showing that a better matching in the relative space leads to a more transferable continuous prompt. Effect of normalization to target embedding space.We further provide an ablation study on the normalization of target embeddings introduced in Eqn. (6). Specifically, we compare the perfor- mance of the target prompts with or without the normalization treatment. From Figure 3, we observe that, when the source and target models are identical (non-transfer set- tings), the normalization hurts the performance, as it distorts the original word embedding space. However, the gap is minimal, which provides additional evidence that we are able to recover the original embeddings through our relative space even with the normalization. When the source and target models are different, however, the normalization significantly improves the performance. The results confirm that the normalization treatment can better cast the relative embedding of a source-induced continuous prompt into the target embedding space, directly under- stood by the target language model. Effect of the anchor numbers and prompt length.We analyze the number of anchors and the prompt length. We first varied the number of anchors from the set {512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 17230}, where 17, 230 is the number of the shared tokens in different language models considered in this study. The anchor number decides the feature dimensionality of the relative representations, shown in Eqns. (3) and (4). Figure 4a reveals a general trend of improved transfer performance with an increasing number of anchors. When we have 512 anchors, the transfer performance is the lowest, which is due to the inadequate capacity of the low-dimensional relative space. On the other hand, using the entire shared vocabulary results in a marginal decrease in performance. This is reasonable because the embeddings of rare words may not be well trained, consequently introducing noise to the high-dimensional feature space. 8Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 We then investigate the effect of prompt length on transfer performance, where we chose the length from the set {1, 3, 5, 10}. We observe in Figure 4b that the performance of transfer improves until a certain point, namely, five virtual tokens in our case. With a prompt length of 10, the transfer performance decreases slightly. Overall, our approach is robust to these hyperparameters. Based on this analysis, we set the number of anchors to 8192 and the prompt length to 5 in our main experiments (see ¬ß 3.2). Additional results. We provide additional results in the appendices. These include a study of transferring induced prompts across different model architectures, such as from BERT to GPT-2, detailed in ¬ßB.1. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our method to classification tasks, discussed in ¬ßB.2. 4 R ELATED WORK In recent years, language models (LMs) have shown impressive few-shot learning capabilities that allow them to be adapted to a variety of downstream tasks through the design of textual prompts (Brown et al., 2020). Subsequent research improves the performance of NLP tasks by creating discrete prompts that are manually crafted, searched through gradient descent (Shin et al., 2020), or using reinforcement learning (Deng et al., 2022). Meanwhile, there has been a growing interest in continuous prompts tuning (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Zhong et al., 2021). These studies suggest that tuning a small number of parameters in prompt embeddings can match the performance of full-model finetuning (Houlsby et al., 2019; Lester et al., 2021), which shows the potential of continuous prompt tuning. Several previous studies have tried to utilize the induced continuous prompt to other tasks or other LMs. For example, Vu et al. (2022) show that prompt embeddings induced on a certain task can be used to initialize the prompts for similar tasks. This led to further research on retrieving and mixing continuous prompts for new tasks (Asai et al., 2022; Su et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). Su et al. (2022) further study the transferability of continuous prompts in cross-LM scenarios. They propose to train a projector between the embedding space of two LMs with parallel induced prompt embeddings or task signals, which contrasts with the zero-shot transfer approach in this work. Rakotonirina et al. (2023) and Wen et al. (2023) investigate zero-shot transferability between differ- ent LMs using the induced discrete prompts. Their work is orthogonal to ours as we focus on the cross-model transfer of continuous prompts. Although transferring discrete prompts offers greater simplicity compared with our proposed continuous prompt transfer, continuous prompts are more versatile and can be adapted to a broader range of applications. The concept of mapping different embeddings into a shared latent space has been well explored in the cross-lingual scenario (Faruqui & Dyer, 2014; Lazaridou et al., 2015; Artetxe et al., 2018), which further paves the way for unsupervised neural machine translation (Lample et al., 2018). We follow the assumption from these studies and assume the induced task embeddings (Vu et al., 2022) from different language models share similar latent structures. We employ relative represen- tation (Moschella et al., 2023) to encode a source-induced prompt, and decode it to the embedding space of the target model. 5 C ONCLUSION We introduced a zero-shot method for transferring continuous prompts between different language models through a relative space. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach, and we further provide insights into the correlation between a model‚Äôs transferability and its expressive power. Moreover, we propose a simple method to improve the generalizability of prompt transfer by using multiple source models. Given the shift towards unified large language models (Brown et al., 2020), our method could enable smaller source models to act as effective ‚Äúsoft prompt engineers‚Äù that perform better than manual prompting. Additionally, it is a promising direction to explore direct human‚Äìmodel interactions that bypass the need for discrete language. This will involve prompting pretrained language models using continuous prompts transferred from sources like encoded brain signals (Zou et al., 2021). 9Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 REFERENCES Mikel Artetxe, Gorka Labaka, and Eneko Agirre.

Each model is trained with distinct pretraining tasks and datasets. In this study, we focus on transferring continuous prompts between masked language models, as this fill-in-the-blank mechanism is a natural way to probe knowledge (Shin et al., 2020). We also provide a preliminary empirical investigation of transferring continuous prompts between different model structures, e.g., from the encoder-only BERT model to the decoder-only GPT-2 model, which is discussed in ¬ßB.1. Due to the variations in pretraining datasets and tokenizing methods, the language models in differ- ent families (e.g., BERT vs. RoBERTa) have different vocabularies. We obtained a shared vocabu- lary of tokens by taking the intersection of these individual vocabularies. During the transfer, we first encode the source prompt embeddings to the entire relative space. Then, we pick top- k dimensions of highest values (k = 8192) and set the rest of zero, which follows Norelli et al. (2022). A.2 D ETAILS OF THE PROJECTOR BASELINE One of our baselines is a projector that maps the source embedding space to the target one. We trained a two-layer neural network as the projector based on the shared vocabulary. Specifically, we have Proj(es i) =W2(f(W1es i + b1)) +b2, (8) where f is the Leaky ReLU activation function (Xu et al., 2015). For some anchor wordi, we denote by es i and et i the word embeddings of the source model and target model, respectively. We train the projector by minimizing the mean squared error loss: LMSE = 1 k kX i=1 (Proj(es i) ‚àí et i), (9) where k is the size of shared vocabulary between two language models. We trained the neural network with 10 epochs using the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2014). The learning rate was 5e-3 and the batch size was 16. The hidden dimension of this two-layer neural network was 768. We ran the validation on target models after each training epoch with the projected target prompt embeddings. We chose the projector with the highest validation performance and used it for test.

B.1 T RANSFER BETWEEN DIFFERENT MODEL ARCHITECTURES We first demonstrate the feasibility of transferring continuous prompts across different model archi- tectures. This experiment explores the transferability between encoder and decoder models, focusing on generative GPT-2 models of varying sizes: small, medium, and large, as detailed in Table 4. We selected BERTbase and RoBERTabase, two encoder models, for our primary experiment to examine the transferability of prompts to or from GPT-2 models. Table 5 shows the results of transferring continuous prompts across architectures on the LAMA dataset, including comparisons with the performance of directly tuned and manually prompted tar- get models for reference. We see that the prompts induced on the encoder models, BERT base and RoBERTabase, are transferable to the GPT-2 models with different sizes. Notably, RoBERTa base shows its best transferability, outperforming the manual prompting baseline across all target mod- els. However, we found that the GPT-2 models as the source cannot induce as meaningful prompts as the encoder models, often underperforming manual prompting. The underlying reason contributing to the poor transferability of the continuous prompts induced on GPT-2 models remains unexplored and merits further study. B.2 R ESULTS ON CLASSIFICATION TASKS Now we show our proposed transfer method is effective on other NLP tasks. Specifically, we include SST-2, a binary sentiment classification task, and DBpedia, a 14-category topic classification task. Unlike LAMA‚Äôs entity prediction which requires the model to consider the whole vocabulary, the classification task only requires prediction within the label words based on the prompt, for example, ‚Äúgreat‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù for the SST-2 dataset (Sun et al., 2022). As shown in Table 6, compared to using manual prompts on the target model directly, transferring prompts from both BERT base and RoBERTabase to the RoBERTalarge target model yields better re- sults. In line with our previous findings, RoBERTa base shows its superior transferability. Overall, our additional results present the potential of applying our approach to various tasks and model architectures. 14Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to thank Ning Shi for his insightful suggestion of the multi-source transfer ap- proach.

Introduction Scaling pre-trained language models (PTMs) has shown increasing power on a wide range of NLP tasks (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020; 2021b; Zeng et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2021; Qiu et al., 2020). Extremely large PTMs can easily generalize to various downstream tasks with a few labeled samples (Brown et al., 2020). However, making these large PTMs beneÔ¨Åt everyone is a challenge. On the one hand, running such models can be very expensive or even infeasible for most users. On the other hand, the model parameters are often not open-sourced due to commercial 1Fudan University 2East China Normal University 3Peng Cheng Laboratory.

Users Query  Response Server Mixed-Task Batch PTM Inference (Black-Box)  Task Prompt (Tunable) Samples Update Prompt Figure 1.Illustration of Language-Model-as-a-Service (LMaaS). Users can query the PTM deployed on the server through a black- box API. In each query, users can input a task prompt and a batch of texts. On the server side, the samples can be mixed in a large batch to be fed into the PTM. By iteratively querying the PTM through the black-box API, users can optimize and Ô¨Ånally obtain good prompts to solve the language tasks of interest. considerations and the potential risk of misuse.1 Therefore, large PTMs such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), ERNIE 3.0 (Sun et al., 2021) and Yuan 1.0 (Wu et al., 2021) are usually released as a service, allowing users to access these powerful models through black-box APIs. In this scenario, called Language-Model-as-a-Service (LMaaS), users can solve the language tasks of interest using the black-box APIs by crafting task-speciÔ¨Åc text prompts or including training samples in the input texts (a.k.a. in- context learning (Brown et al., 2020)). Due to the great power of the general-purpose PTMs underlying the APIs, such approaches can achieve considerable performance on simple language tasks, and therefore have powered many interesting applications2. However, querying large PTMs through hand-crafted text prompts cannot fully exploit la- beled data, resulting in unsatisfactory performance in many use cases. Instead of designing discrete text prompts, recently much effort has been devoted to continuous prompt tuning (Li & Liang, 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2021; Liu et al., 1https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/ 2See https://gpt3demo.com/ for examples. arXiv:2201.03514v4  [cs.CL]  27 Jun 2022Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service 2021b), which is to optimize the continuous prompt injected to the text while keeping the PTM parameters frozen. Such methods only require storing a small continuous prompt for each task, and therefore are highly deployment-efÔ¨Åcient. Besides, tuning the continuous prompt can be as effective as Ô¨Åne-tuning the entire model when the PTM becomes large (Lester et al., 2021). However, in all the previous methods, the continuous prompts are learned through back- propagation, which is unavailable in the scenario of LMaaS. Can we optimize the task-speciÔ¨Åc continuous prompts when we only have access to the PTM inference API? Since gradients are unavailable, we can only invoke derivative-free optimization (DFO) 3 (Kolda et al., 2003; Conn et al., 2009; Rios & Sahinidis, 2013). DFO involves a kind of optimization algorithms that do not depend on gra- dients, but only relies on function values (or Ô¨Åtness values) of sampled solutions. However, DFO algorithms are known to suffer from slow convergence rate when the dimension- ality of the search space is high. Thus, it is intractable to optimize even only the continuous prompts, which can be tens of thousands of parameters, using DFO algorithms. Fortunately, recent work found that common PTMs, despite their large numbers of parameters, have a very low intrinsic dimensionality (Aghajanyan et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2021). That means, there exists a low-dimensional reparameteriza- tion that is as effective for Ô¨Åne-tuning as the full parameter space. It has been demonstrated that optimizing only hun- dreds (Aghajanyan et al., 2021) or even dozens (Qin et al., 2021) of parameters can achieve non-trivial performance. Given that the intrinsic dimensionality of the objective func- tion (in our case is the forward computation of PTMs) is low, the optimization can be effectively solved via DFO al- gorithms with random embedding (Wang et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2016; Letham et al., 2020). Based on the these insights, this paper proposes the Black- Box Tuning (BBT) to solve various language understand- ing tasks by only accessing the PTM inference API. In particular, we manage to optimize the continuous prompt prepended to the input text by iteratively querying the PTM inference API, as brieÔ¨Çy depicted in Figure 1. To han- dle the high dimensionality of the continuous prompt, we project the original prompt space using a random linear projection onto a much smaller subspace and solve this optimization problem with some derivative-free optimizer in that smaller subsapce. In contrast to conventional Ô¨Åne- tuning methods that can only be performed by the service side, black-box tuning allows users to optimize their task- speciÔ¨Åc prompts locally on resource-limited devices (even without GPUs). Our experimental results demonstrate that prompting RoBERTaLARGE (Liu et al., 2019) using BBT on 3Also termed as black-box, zeroth-order or gradient-free opti- mization. a few labeled samples not only outperforms manual prompt and in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020), but also out- performs its gradient-based counterparts, namely prompt tuning (Lester et al., 2021) and full model tuning. The contribution of this paper is three folds:4 ‚Ä¢ This paper proposes a novel scenario (LMaaS) where one should learn to prompt the PTMs by only accessing their inference APIs. ‚Ä¢ This paper offers a solution (BBT) for such a scenario to accomplish common language understanding tasks without access to model parameters and gradients, such that large-scale PTMs can better beneÔ¨Åt users. ‚Ä¢ Empirical results show that DFO can successfully deal with real-world language tasks by learning to prompt large-scale PTMs with more than millions of parame- ters. Thus, this work pioneers the work of optimizing large-scale PTMs through DFO methods. 2. Background Large-Scale PTMs as APIs. It is a promising way to de- ploy large-scale PTMs to serve downstream applications by providing general-purpose APIs. For the service side, wrapping the computation of the PTM into an easy-to-use API has become a common practice (Brown et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2021). In contrast to training, the in- ference speed of large-scale PTMs can be highly optimized with acceleration techniques such as ORT and TensorRT. In addition, large-scale PTMs are often not open-sourced due to the commercial reasons and the potential risk of mis- use. For the user side , even if the large-scale PTMs are available, it is expensive or even infeasible to locally run them. Thus, how to exploit the PTM inference API to solve conventional language tasks is a promising direction. Intrinsic Dimensionality of PTMs. The intrinsic dimen- sionality of an objective function is the minimum number of parameters needed to obtain satisfactory solutions (Li et al., 2018). In particular, the intrinsic dimensionality in- dicates the lowest dimensional reparameterization that is as effective for optimizing as the full parameter space. Li et al. (2018) propose to measure the intrinsic dimensionality of neural networks by Ô¨Ånding the minimal dimensionality of the subspace that is randomly projected from the full trainable parameters, in which they can optimize the neural networks to achieve satisfactory solutions. Aghajanyan et al. (2021) empirically show that large-scale pre-training implic- itly compresses the intrinsic dimensionality of downstream NLP tasks. By tuning only hundreds of parameters that 4Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ txsun1997/Black-Box-TuningBlack-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service are then randomly projected onto the full parameter space of RoBERTa, they can achieve 90% performance relative to full model tuning. Qin et al. (2021) show that intrinsic subspace on various tasks can be compressed to less than 100 dimensions with multi-task supervision. This line of research, along with the work of parameter-efÔ¨Åcient tun- ing (Houlsby et al., 2019; Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2021a; He et al., 2021), demonstrate that PTMs can well adapt to downstream tasks by tuning a very small proportion of parameters, which im- plies the possibility of optimizing large-scale PTMs with derivative-free algorithms. Prompt-Based Learning. Prompt-based learning is to formulate downstream tasks as a (masked) language mod- eling task, and therefore reduces the gap between PTM pre-training and Ô¨Åne-tuning (Brown et al., 2020; Schick & Sch¬®utze, 2021a;b; Gao et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2022). For instance, one can use BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) to predict whether the sentence ‚ÄùThis is a fantastic movie‚Äù is positive or negative by appending the prompt ‚ÄùIt was [MASK]‚Äù and see if BERT predicts ‚Äùgreat‚Äù or ‚Äùterrible‚Äù at the masked position. Note that the prompt is not necessarily discrete, it can also be optimized efÔ¨Åciently in continuous space with gradient descent (Li & Liang, 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2021; Qin & Eisner, 2021; Liu et al., 2021b; Zhong et al., 2021). In the case of only tuning the continuous prompt while keeping the parameters of large PTMs untouched, one can retain the efÔ¨Åcient serving beneÔ¨Åts while matching the performance of full model tuning (Lester et al., 2021). Our work also proposes to optimize the continuous prompt while keeping the PTM parameters unchanged, but without gradient descent. Derivative-Free Optimization. Derivative-free optimiza- tion (DFO) realizes optimization only via the function val- ues f(x) on the sampled solutions x. Most DFO algorithms share a common structure of sampling-and-updating to en- hance the quality of solutions. Representative DFO algo- rithms include evolutionary algorithms (Hansen et al., 2003), Bayesian optimization (Shahriari et al., 2016), etc. Due to their ability of addressing complex optimization tasks, DFO algorithms have achieved many impressive applica- tions in automatic machine learning (Snoek et al., 2012), reinforcement learning (Salimans et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2017), objective detection (Zhang et al., 2015b), etc. 3. Approach 3.1. Problem Formulation Common language understanding tasks can be formulated as a classiÔ¨Åcation task, which is to predict for a batch of input texts X the labels Y. To solve the target language understanding task with a general-purpose PTM, we should modify X with some template (e.g., adding some trigger words and a special token [MASK] for BERT-like PTMs) and map the labels Y to some words in the PTM vocab- ulary (e.g., the sentiment label ‚Äùpositive‚Äù can be mapped to ‚Äùgreat‚Äù). The modiÔ¨Åed inputs and labels are denoted as ÀúX and ÀúY. Assume the BERT-like PTM inference API f takes a continuous prompt p and a batch of modiÔ¨Åed texts ÀúX as input, and outputs the logits on the masked positions, i.e., ÀÜY = f(p; ÀúX). With the output logits, we can calculate the loss on this batch of data, which is not necessarily to be differentiable. Our goal is to Ô¨Ånd the optimal prompt p‚ãÜ = arg minp‚ààPL(f(p; ÀúX),ÀúY), where Pis some search space of interest and Lis some loss function such as nega- tive accuracy. The black-box function f is not available to the optimizer in closed form, but can be evaluated at a query point (p; ÀúX). 3.2. Black-Box Tuning As demonstrated by Lester et al. (2021), dozens of prompt to- kens are required to obtain a competitive performance when only tuning continuous prompts. Given that the embedding dimensionality of large-scale PTMs is usually larger than one thousand (e.g., the word embeddings of RoBERTaLARGE are 1024-dimensional), the dimensionality of the continuous prompt p ‚ààRD that we are interested to optimize can be tens of thousands, which makes derivative-free optimization intractable. To handle this high-dimensional optimization, since large-scale PTMs have a low intrinsic dimensional- ity (Aghajanyan et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2021), we manage to optimize z ‚ààRd in a much smaller subspace (d‚â™D), and use a random projection matrix A ‚ààRD√ód to project z on the original prompt space P. Note that directly projecting z onto the prompt space that is compatible with the PTM is non-trivial. To ease the optimization, we instead optimize the increment of some initial prompt p0. For simplicity, we randomly sample n tokens from the PTM vocabulary as initialization. Thus, our objective becomes z‚ãÜ = arg min z‚ààZ L(f(Az + p0; ÀúX),ÀúY) , (1) where Zis the search space. Previous work (Wang et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2016; Letham et al., 2020) in derivative- free optimization usually sets each entry in the random matrix A by sampling from some normal distribution. How- ever, this sampling strategy does not perform well in our scenario. Instead, we set values of the random matrix A by sampling from a uniform distribution adopted in He et al. (2015) (cf. Appendix A for the comparison). We restrict the search space to Z= [‚àí5,5]d. For the loss functionL, a straightforward alternative is using negative accuracy. However, the reward of accuracy can beBlack-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service Best film ever . It was <MASK> . A totally boring movie ! It was <MASK> . You 'll probably love it .

Given z ‚ààRd provided by the derivative-free optimizer, we project it to the prompt space by a random matrix A ‚ààRD√ód. By adding the projected prompt embeddings Az with some initial prompt embeddings p0 (in this illustration are the embeddings of tokens randomly sampled from the PTM‚Äôs vocabulary), we obtain the Ô¨Ånal prompt embeddings that are then concatenated with the input texts ÀúX. By calling the black-box API f, which implements the forward computation of the PTM, the predictions on the masked positions are obtained, i.e., ÀÜY = f(p; ÀúX). With the prediction ÀÜY and the golden labels ÀúY at hand, we can calculate the loss that is used by the derivative-free optimizer to suggest a new z. sparse and less informative, especially when training data is limited. Thus, we also consider two loss functions that are more sensitive to predictions, i.e., cross entropy and hinge loss. Given the output logits ÀÜ yover a candidate set of label words, and the golden label word Àúyof a certain sample, the cross entropy is deÔ¨Åned as LCE(ÀÜ y,Àúy) =‚àílog SoftmaxÀúy(ÀÜ y). (2) For hinge loss, we adopt a multi-class extension (Weston & Watkins, 1999), LHinge(ÀÜ y,Àúy) = ‚àë iÃ∏=Àúy max(0,Œ≥ + ÀÜ yi ‚àíÀÜ yÀúy). (3) In this work we set the margin Œ≥ = 2. The performances of using cross entropy, hinge loss, and negative accuracy are compared in Figure 3. 3.3. The CMA Evolution Strategy As demonstrated in Aghajanyan et al. (2021), the intrinsic dimensionality of PTMs like RoBERTa LARGE on various tasks can be hundreds. To handle optimization of such scale, we adopt the CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evo- lution Strategy) (Hansen & Ostermeier, 2001; Hansen et al., 2003), which is a widely used evolutionary algorithm for non-convex black-box optimization in continuous domain. In particular, CMA-ES maintains a parameterized search distribution model, i.e., multivariate normal distribution. In each iteration, CMA-ES samples a population of new query solutions (also referred to as individuals or offspring) from the multivariate normal distribution model z(t+1) i ‚àºm(t) + œÉ(t)N(0,C(t)) , (4) where i= 1,...,Œª and Œªis the population size. m(t) ‚ààRd is the mean vector of the search distribution at iteration step t, œÉ(t) ‚ààR+ is the overall standard deviation that controls the step length, and C(t) ‚ààRd√ód is the covariance matrix that determines the shape of the distribution ellipsoid. By maximizing the likelihood of successful steps, m(t), œÉ(t), C(t) are updated (cf. Hansen (2016) for more details). 3.4. Pre-Training Prompt Embedding Considering that sentence-pair tasks can share the same template and label words, as shown in Table 1, we can pre- train a prompt embedding p0 on some publicly available NLI task (in our experiments we use the MNLI (Williams et al., 2018) training set) for a better initialization. For other classiÔ¨Åcation tasks we set p0 as word embeddings randomly drawn from the vocabulary of RoBERTaLARGE. 4. Experiments 4.1. Setup Dataset. We conduct experiments on several common language understanding tasks including sentiment analy- sis, topic classiÔ¨Åcation, natural language inference (NLI),Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service Table 1.Statistics, manual templates, and label words used in our experiments. |Y| : number of classes.

For sentiment analysis, we choose SST- 2 (Socher et al., 2013) and Yelp polarity (Zhang et al., 2015a). For topic classiÔ¨Åcation, we choose AG‚Äôs News and DBPedia (Zhang et al., 2015a). For NLI, we choose SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015) and RTE (Wang et al., 2019). For paraphrase, we choose MRPC (Dolan & Brockett, 2005). The statistics, manual templates and label words of these datasets are shown in Table 1. Few-Shot Setting. For a broad range of users, the amount of labeled data can be limited, in which case they can resort to the deployed large PTMs due to their great power of few- shot learning (Brown et al., 2020). Hence, in this paper we conduct experiments in the few-shot setting. We randomly select ksamples for each class to construct a k-shot training set Dtrain, and compose a development set Ddev by randomly drawing another ksamples from the original training set and ensure that |Dtrain|= |Ddev|to simulate the true few-shot learning setting (Perez et al., 2021). Following Zhang et al. (2021a), Gao et al. (2021), and Gu et al. (2021), we use the original development sets as the test sets. For datasets with- out development sets, we use the original test sets. Hence, in our experiments |Dtest|‚â´|D train|= |Ddev|. Backbone Model. We choose RoBERTaLARGE (Liu et al., 2019) as our backbone model because: (1) We mainly fo- cus on language understanding tasks; (2) Aghajanyan et al. (2021) have demonstrated that RoBERTaLARGE has a very small intrinsic dimensionality (about hundreds) on many tasks. It is worth noting that generative PTMs such as GPT (Brown et al., 2020), T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) and BART (Lewis et al., 2020) are also compatible with our framework if we convert downstream tasks into a uniÔ¨Åed text-to-text format. We leave for future work the applica- tions of generative PTMs. Baselines. We compare our proposed black-box tuning with two kinds of methods: gradient-based methods and gradient-free methods. For gradient-based methods, we consider three baselines: (1) Prompt Tuning: Following Lester et al. (2021), we only train the continuous prompts Table 2.Default conÔ¨Åguration of hyper-parameters. Hyper-parameter Default Prompt length (L) 50 Subspace dimension (d) 500 Population size (Œª) 20 Random projection (A) Uniform Loss functionL Cross Entropy Budget (# of API calls) 8000 prepended to the input texts while keeping the PTM frozen. We use an Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015) with learn- ing rate of 5e-4 and batch size of 16 for 1000 epochs. For fair comparison, we use the same prompt length, manual template, label words, and the same pre-trained prompt em- bedding for initialization on sentence-pair tasks as black-box tuning. (2) P-Tuning v2 (Liu et al., 2021a) is an improved variant of prompt tuning. Instead of injecting continuous prompts merely into the input layer, P-Tuning v2 prepends and optimizes continuous prompts at every layer of the PTM. We optimize the prompts of length 128 at each layer using an Adam optimizer with learning rate of 5e-4 and batch size of 32 for 2000 epochs. (3) Model Tuning: We Ô¨Åne-tune the entire PTM on each task using an Adam optimizer with learning rate of 1e-5 and batch size of 16 for 200 epochs. For gradient-free methods, we consider three baselines: (1) Manual Prompt: We directly use the templates and label words in Table 1 to conduct zero-shot evaluation. The re- sults of manual prompt can be seen as initial points of our method. (2) In-context Learning: Following Brown et al. (2020), we randomly select up to 32 training samples and concatenate them with the input texts. (3) Feature-based Methods: Feature-based methods (Peters et al., 2019) is also a competitive baseline for LMaaS, where one can re- quest the features encoded by the large PTM and locally train a classiÔ¨Åer to accomplish the task of interest. Here we consider two implementations: (a) Feature-MLP: We train a two-layered MLP classiÔ¨Åer on the [CLS] representation of the PTM. (b) Feature-BiLSTM: We train a bidirectional LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) on the repre- sentations of the sequence of tokens, followed by a linear classiÔ¨Åer on the top. For both implementations of feature-Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service based methods, we use an Adam optimizer with learning rate of 3e-4 and batch size of 16 to train the attached clas- siÔ¨Åers for 1000 epochs. For black-box tuning, we give in Table 2 the default conÔ¨Åguration of hyper-parameters used in our experiments. The effect of each hyper-parameter is explored in ¬ß 4.3. 4.2. Results Overall Comparison. We Ô¨Årst demonstrate the experi- mental results of black-box tuning and the baselines across 7 datasets in Table 3. The proposed black-box tuning sig- niÔ¨Åcantly outperforms the other four gradient-free methods. We observe that in-context learning performs even worse than manual prompt on some tasks, and suffers from high variance. That means, in-context learning cannot effectively utilize labeled samples included in the context. Feature- based methods perform slightly better than manual prompt and in-context learning. Meanwhile, Feature-BiLSTM out- performs Feature-MLP due to its advantage of using more informative features. Surprisingly, black-box tuning also outperforms its gradient-based counterparts, namely prompt tuning, p-tuning v2, and model tuning, on average perfor- mance of the 7 tasks. Note that the only difference between prompt tuning and black-box tuning is whether we use gra- dient descent (i.e., Adam optimizer) or DFO algorithm (i.e., CMA-ES). Based on the experimental results, we suspect that gradient-based optimization tends to overÔ¨Åt the small training data while DFO tends to Ô¨Ånd better solutions due to its exploration mechanism. In addition, we Ô¨Ånd that model tuning performs much better than prompt tuning and black- box tuning when number of classes is large (e.g., DBPedia). On NLI tasks (i.e., SNLI and RTE), when using pre-trained prompt embedding (¬ß 3.4), prompt tuning and black-box tuning signiÔ¨Åcantly outperform model tuning, which also conÔ¨Årms the effectiveness of prompt pre-training (Gu et al., 2021) in the context of black-box tuning. Detailed Comparison. In the scenario of LMaaS, there are many other factors to be considered. In Table 4 we com- pare black-box tuning and the baseline methods in terms of deployment efÔ¨Åciency, viability of as-a-service, training time, memory usage on the user side and the server side, and the amount of data to be uploaded and downloaded. Model tuning is not deployment-efÔ¨Åcient because it needs to main- tain a copy of the entire model for each user. Gradient-based methods cannot make the PTM serve as a service due to the requirement of gradients. Feature-based methods and black-box tuning are suitable for LMaaS. However, feature- based methods cannot achieve competitive results when labeled data is limited. Therefore, among all the considered methods, only black-box tuning can achieve satisfactory performance while maintaining reasonable training time, memory footprint, and network load. Unlike gradient-based methods, in which the optimization cost is proportional to the size of the PTM, the optimization cost of black-box tuning is decoupled from the scale of the PTM, and only relies on the subspace dimensionality. For fair compari- son of training time, we perform early stopping for all the compared methods, i.e., we stop learning if the development accuracy does not increase after 1000 steps. All the methods are implemented with PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019) and ex- perimented on a single NVIDIA GTX 3090 GPU. Note that the process of model inference can be further accelerated via better implementations (e.g., using ONNX and TensorRT). In Table 4 we also report the training time of black-box tuning using ONNX Runtime. Detailed calculation of the amount of data to be uploaded/downloaded can be found in Appendix C. 4.3. Ablation Study In this section, we conduct ablation experiments on various hyper-parameters. To control experimental variables, we explore the effect of each hyper-parameter while keeping the other hyper-parameters as default as listed in Table 2. To stablize the experimental results and reduce the variance over different runs, we conduct ablation experiments in 64- shot setting. Each run is performed on the same data split with different random seeds. Experimental results of abla- tions on loss functions L, subspace dimensionality d, and prompt length Lare demonstrated in Figure 3. Additional ablation studies on the effect of the random projection A, the effect of the population size Œª, and the ablations in the 16-shot setting are in Appendix A. For each ablation, we show results under different budget, which is measured by the number of PTM inference API calls. In each API call, one can provide a continuous prompt p and query the results of the PTM forward computation on a batch of training data. In our few-shot setting, we can put all the training data into one batch, and therefore the objective function to be optimized is deterministic instead of stochastic. CMA-ES vs. Adam. We compare our used derivative- free optimizer, CMA-ES, with a competitive Ô¨Årst-order opti- mizer, Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015). For fair comparison, we update the continuous prompt using Adam with the gra- dients over the entire training data (i.e., batch size equals to |Dtrain|). We use learning rate of 1e-3 for Adam opti- mizer. As shown in the top row of Figure 3, Adam optimizer achieves faster convergence on both SST-2 and AG‚Äôs News due to the gradients it used. On the development sets, Adam performs slight worse than CMA-ES with cross entropy on SST-2 but better on AG‚Äôs News. But as demonstrated in Ta- ble 3, using Adam optimizer performs worse than CMA-ES on the average performance across seven task test sets.Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service Table 3.Overall comparison on various language understanding tasks. We report mean and standard deviation of performance over 3 different splits (¬ß 4.1). All of the results are obtained with pre-trained RoBERTaLARGE in 16-shot (per class) setting.

We consider three loss functions: cross entropy, hinge loss, and negative accuracy. As depicted in the top row of Figure 3, cross entropy and hinge loss signif- icantly outperform the negative accuracy. In the few-shot setting, the accuracy as a reward can be sparse, and cannot provide informative directions for optimization. On SST- 2 and AG‚Äôs News, we obtain that cross entropy performs slightly better than hinge loss. Subspace Dimensionality. The subspace of dimensional- ity dis the space where the optimization actually performs. According to the intrinsic dimensionality found in Agha- janyan et al. (2021), we explore the subspace dimensionality of {100, 200, 500, 1000}within the budget of {2k, 4k, 6k, 8k}. Accordingly, we set population size Œª= 4 + 3 log(d). As shown in the middle row of Figure 3, the best subspace dimensionality can be different on different tasks (d= 200 performs the best on SST-2 development set and d= 500 performs the best on AG‚Äôs News development set), which is related to the observation that intrinsic dimensionality varies across different tasks (Aghajanyan et al., 2021). In general, a small subspace (e.g., d= 100) is hard to cover a good solution, while a large subspace (e.g., d= 1000) may lead to poor generalization. Prompt Length. Prompt length L determines the di- mensionality of the original parameter space (in our case D= L√ó1024). We evaluate black-box tuning under each budget in {2k, 4k, 6k, 8k}while varying the prompt length in {10, 20, 50, 100}. As shown in the bottom row of Fig- ure 3, shorter prompt confers faster convergence on the training sets but does not yield better generalization on the development sets. L = 50achieves the best accuracy on both SST-2 and AG‚Äôs News development sets.Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Iterations over entire training data (| train|=128) 82.5 85.0 87.5 90.0 92.5 95.0 97.5 100.0Train accuracy (current best) SST-2 (train) Adam (cross entropy) CMA-ES (cross entropy) CMA-ES (hinge loss) CMA-ES (-accuracy) 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Iterations over entire training data (| train|=128) 77.5 80.0 82.5 85.0 87.5 90.0 92.5 95.0Dev accuracy (current best) SST-2 (dev) Adam (cross entropy) CMA-ES (cross entropy) CMA-ES (hinge loss) CMA-ES (-accuracy) 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Iterations over entire training data (| train|=128) 75 80 85 90 95 100Train accuracy (current best) AG's News (train) Adam (cross entropy) CMA-ES (cross entropy) CMA-ES (hinge loss) CMA-ES (-accuracy) 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Iterations over entire training data (| train|=128) 78 80 82 84 86 88 90Dev accuracy (current best) AG's News (dev) Adam (cross entropy) CMA-ES (cross entropy) CMA-ES (hinge loss) CMA-ES (-accuracy) 2000 4000 6000 8000 Budget (number of API calls) 94 95 96 97 98 99 100Train accuracy (current best) SST-2 (train) d = 1000 d = 500 d = 200 d = 100 2000 4000 6000 8000 Budget (number of API calls) 89 90 91 92 93 94Dev accuracy (current best) SST-2 (dev) d = 1000 d = 500 d = 200 d = 100 2000 4000 6000 8000 Budget (number of API calls) 84 86 88 90 92Train accuracy (current best) AG's News (train) d = 1000 d = 500 d = 200 d = 100 2000 4000 6000 8000 Budget (number of API calls) 83 84 85 86 87 88Dev accuracy (current best) AG's News (dev) d = 1000 d = 500 d = 200 d = 100 2000 4000 6000 8000 Budget (number of API calls) 95 96 97 98 99 100Train accuracy (current best) SST-2 (train) L = 10 L = 20 L = 50 L = 100 2000 4000 6000 8000 Budget (number of API calls) 88 89 90 91 92 93 94Dev accuracy (current best) SST-2 (dev) L = 10 L = 20 L = 50 L = 100 2000 4000 6000 8000 Budget (number of API calls) 82 84 86 88 90 92 94Train accuracy (current best) AG's News (train) L = 10 L = 20 L = 50 L = 100 2000 4000 6000 8000 Budget (number of API calls) 83 84 85 86 87 88Dev accuracy (current best) AG's News (dev) L = 10 L = 20 L = 50 L = 100 Figure 3.Ablations of loss function, subspace dimensionality, and prompt length.

Discussion and Future Work In this section we discuss our proposed method in the con- text of (1) derivative-free optimization and (2) prompt-based learning, respectively. By drawing comparisons with these two lines of research, we highlight some directions that could improve this work in future. Comparison with Previous Derivative-Free Approaches. Our proposed method lies in the same framework of previ- ous work that solves high-dimensional derivative-free op- timization problems via random embedding (Wang et al., 2016). In contrast, we set the random embedding A by sampling from a uniform distribution instead of normal dis- tributions, and use the CMA-ES to perform optimization in the generated subspace. In previous work, the target black- box functions are usually synthetic functions where only a few dimensions can affect the function values, and therefore most of the dimensions are strictly non-effective. In our real- world scenario, the intrinsic dimension can be approximate. In the context of PTMs, a more appropriate substitution for the term intrinsic dimensionality can be œµ-effective dimen- sionality (Qian et al., 2016). Considering the relaxation to the intrinsic dimensionality of PTMs, more suitable ap- proaches such as sequential random embedding (Qian et al., 2016) and other more advanced methods of constructing the random projection matrix (Letham et al., 2020) should be explored in future work. Besides, the subspace generated by random projection can be sub-optimal. As demonstrated in Qin et al. (2021), training the projection A with multi- task supervision can result in better and smaller subspace. Besides, larger PTMs generally have lower intrinsic dimen- sionalities (Aghajanyan et al., 2021), as a result, we can use smaller subspace and more efÔ¨Åcient DFO algorithms such as Bayesian optimization on larger PTMs. Comparison with Previous Prompt-Based Learning Ap- proaches. From the perspective of prompt-based learning, our method is similar to prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021), where only the continuous prompt prepended to the input text is tuned, so our method also retains the beneÔ¨Åts of efÔ¨Å- cient serving and mixed-task inference. In addition to the continuous prompt, we also insert some hard prompt tokens (e.g., ‚ÄùIt was [MASK]‚Äù) in the input text, which has been demonstrated to be effective in previous work (Gu et al., 2021) in the name of hybrid prompt tuning. Different from previous prompt-based learning approaches, our prompt tun-Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service ing does not require backpropagation and gradient descent. Considering our used templates and label words are hand- crafted without trial-and-error, the performance reported in this paper is just a lower bound. More advanced techniques such as prompt engineering (Gao et al., 2021), label words engineering (Schick et al., 2020; Shin et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2021b), prompt pre-training (Gu et al., 2021), and prompt ensembling (Lester et al., 2021) are orthogonal to this work and therefore can further improve the performance. For simplicity, we do not integrate these methods and leave for future work.

Additional Experimental Results Random Projection. The random projection matrix A ‚ààRD√ód is a key factor that determines whether and how hard it is to Ô¨Ånd a good solution in the generated subspace. Here we compare two design choices of setting A: The Ô¨Årst choice is commonly used in previous high-dimensional derivative-free optimization work (Wang et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2016), that is setting each entry of A by sampling from a normal distribution. Following Qian et al. (2016), we use N(0,1/d) where d is the subspace dimensionality5. The second choice is setting each entry of A by sampling from a uniform distribution, which is widely used for initializing linear layers in modern neural networks. Here we use the uniform distribution proposed in He et al. (2015). As shown in Figure 4, both random projections can achieve a considerable cross entropy loss on SST-2 and AG‚Äôs News within reasonable budgets but faster convergence is obtained using uniform distribution. 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Number of API calls 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40Cross Entropy Loss SST-2 Normal Uniform 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Number of API calls 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8Cross Entropy Loss AG's News Normal Uniform Figure 4.Effect of random projection A. Population Size. In each iteration of the CMA-ES, a population of solutions are sampled from a multivariate normal distribution model. The evaluation of the population is then used to update the parameters of the multivariate normal distribution model. Here we study the effect of the population size on SST-2. In our experiments, we sequentially evaluate each solution in a population, and therefore larger population size will result in more API calls given the same CMA-ES iterations. As shown in Figure 5, smaller population size confers faster convergence in terms of number of API calls. We also demonstrate the comparison in terms of the CMA-ES iterations, which can be found in the following section. 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Number of API calls 82.5 85.0 87.5 90.0 92.5 95.0 97.5 100.0Train accuracy (current best) SST-2 (train) Pop. size=5 Pop. size=10 Pop. size=15 Pop. size=20 Pop. size=25 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Number of API calls 84 86 88 90 92 94Dev accuracy (current best) SST-2 (dev) Pop. size=5 Pop. size=10 Pop. size=15 Pop. size=20 Pop. size=25 Figure 5.Effect of population size Œª. 5We also tried N(0,1) as used in Wang et al.

Ablation of Subspace Dimensionality and Prompt Length in 16-shot Setting. In ¬ß 4.3, we conduct ablation experi- ments in the 64-shot setting to reduce the variance over different runs. To keep consistent with the experimental setting in Table 3, we demonstrate in Figure 6 the ablation results on subspace dimensionality and prompt length in the 16-shot setting. CMA-ES vs. Adam in Subspaces. In Figure 3, we compare the convergence of prompt tuning (with Adam optimizer) and black-box tuning (with CMA-ES), where Adam performs optimization in the original prompt space (P) while CMA-ES performs in the generated subsapce (Z). Here we also compare the effectiveness and efÔ¨Åciency of Adam and CMA-ES in subspaces. As shown in Figure 7, CMA-ES is more efÔ¨Åcient and stable than Adam in low-dimensional subspaces. When the dimensionality of the subsapce becomes large (e.g., d= 1000), Adam with a appropriate learning rate can perform on par with CMA-ES. Note that CMA-ES does not require back-propagation, so the computation cost of one iteration for CMA-ES and Adam can be very different. For fair comparison, we convert the number of iterations into FLOPs. The FLOPs of one iteration of Adam is estimated to be three times greater than CMA-ES. B. Parallel Evaluation If the training data is smaller, or the server allows larger batches, a promising way to improve training efÔ¨Åciency is to use parallel evaluation. That is, we can evaluate the entire population in parallel, as depicted in Figure 8(a). As demonstrated in Figure 8(b), we can achieve 100% accuracy on the SST-2 training set with population size of 20 and 25 in 300 iterations (API calls). In case of the batch size per API call is limited, we can also use asynchronous queries to simulate the parallel evaluation. C. Estimation of Uploaded/Downloaded Data Size In this section we describe how we estimate the amount of data to be uploaded and downloaded (Table 4). For black-box tuning, there are two kinds of data to be uploaded: (1) training samples, and (2) continuous prompt. A training sample is comprised of two parts: input ids and attention mask. We can use the unsigned short (representation range: 0‚àº65535, 2 bytes per value) for input ids and use the bool type (1 byte per value) for attention mask. For continuous prompt, which contains hundreds of values, we can use the Ô¨Çoat type (4 bytes per value) for representation.Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service Serial Evaluation Population Logits Data Parallel Evaluation (a) 0 100 200 300 Iterations of CMA-ES 82.5 85.0 87.5 90.0 92.5 95.0 97.5 100.0Train accuracy (current best) SST-2 (train) Pop. size=5 Pop. size=10 Pop. size=15 Pop. size=20 Pop. size=25 (b) Figure 8.(a) Illustration of the parallel evaluation. (b) Comparison of the convergence rate with different population sizes using parallel evaluation. Take SST-2 16-shot split as an example, the input ids and attention mask are in shape of 32 √ó47, where 32 is the batch size and 47 is the maximum sequence length, so there are ‚àº2.9KB data for input ids and ‚àº1.5KB data for attention mask. Assume the prompt is 500-dimensional, we need to upload additional ‚àº2KB data for prompt. The data to be downloaded is the output logits of the candidate words, which is a dictionary containing |Y| Ô¨Çoat values. Take SST-2 16-shot split as an example, the size of data to be downloaded is32 √ó2 √ó4bytes = 0.25KB. For feature-based methods we use similar estimation methods. The data size for upload is the same for Feature-MLP and Feature-BiLSTM. The data to be downloaded for Feature-MLP is the representation of the [CLS] token while the data to be downloaded for Feature-BiLSTM is the representation of all the tokens. Note that this estimation, without any data compression, is an upper bound of the real scenario.",

Introduction Scaling pre-trained language models (PTMs) has shown increasing power on a wide range of NLP tasks (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020; 2021b; Zeng et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2021; Qiu et al., 2020). Extremely large PTMs can easily generalize to various downstream tasks with a few labeled samples (Brown et al., 2020). However, making these large PTMs beneÔ¨Åt everyone is a challenge. On the one hand, running such models can be very expensive or even infeasible for most users. On the other hand, the model parameters are often not open-sourced due to commercial 1Fudan University 2East China Normal University 3Peng Cheng Laboratory.

Users Query  Response Server Mixed-Task Batch PTM Inference (Black-Box)  Task Prompt (Tunable) Samples Update Prompt Figure 1.Illustration of Language-Model-as-a-Service (LMaaS). Users can query the PTM deployed on the server through a black- box API. In each query, users can input a task prompt and a batch of texts. On the server side, the samples can be mixed in a large batch to be fed into the PTM. By iteratively querying the PTM through the black-box API, users can optimize and Ô¨Ånally obtain good prompts to solve the language tasks of interest. considerations and the potential risk of misuse.1 Therefore, large PTMs such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), ERNIE 3.0 (Sun et al., 2021) and Yuan 1.0 (Wu et al., 2021) are usually released as a service, allowing users to access these powerful models through black-box APIs. In this scenario, called Language-Model-as-a-Service (LMaaS), users can solve the language tasks of interest using the black-box APIs by crafting task-speciÔ¨Åc text prompts or including training samples in the input texts (a.k.a. in- context learning (Brown et al., 2020)). Due to the great power of the general-purpose PTMs underlying the APIs, such approaches can achieve considerable performance on simple language tasks, and therefore have powered many interesting applications2. However, querying large PTMs through hand-crafted text prompts cannot fully exploit la- beled data, resulting in unsatisfactory performance in many use cases. Instead of designing discrete text prompts, recently much effort has been devoted to continuous prompt tuning (Li & Liang, 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2021; Liu et al., 1https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/ 2See https://gpt3demo.com/ for examples. arXiv:2201.03514v4  [cs.CL]  27 Jun 2022Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service 2021b), which is to optimize the continuous prompt injected to the text while keeping the PTM parameters frozen. Such methods only require storing a small continuous prompt for each task, and therefore are highly deployment-efÔ¨Åcient. Besides, tuning the continuous prompt can be as effective as Ô¨Åne-tuning the entire model when the PTM becomes large (Lester et al., 2021). However, in all the previous methods, the continuous prompts are learned through back- propagation, which is unavailable in the scenario of LMaaS. Can we optimize the task-speciÔ¨Åc continuous prompts when we only have access to the PTM inference API? Since gradients are unavailable, we can only invoke derivative-free optimization (DFO) 3 (Kolda et al., 2003; Conn et al., 2009; Rios & Sahinidis, 2013). DFO involves a kind of optimization algorithms that do not depend on gra- dients, but only relies on function values (or Ô¨Åtness values) of sampled solutions. However, DFO algorithms are known to suffer from slow convergence rate when the dimension- ality of the search space is high. Thus, it is intractable to optimize even only the continuous prompts, which can be tens of thousands of parameters, using DFO algorithms. Fortunately, recent work found that common PTMs, despite their large numbers of parameters, have a very low intrinsic dimensionality (Aghajanyan et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2021). That means, there exists a low-dimensional reparameteriza- tion that is as effective for Ô¨Åne-tuning as the full parameter space. It has been demonstrated that optimizing only hun- dreds (Aghajanyan et al., 2021) or even dozens (Qin et al., 2021) of parameters can achieve non-trivial performance. Given that the intrinsic dimensionality of the objective func- tion (in our case is the forward computation of PTMs) is low, the optimization can be effectively solved via DFO al- gorithms with random embedding (Wang et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2016; Letham et al., 2020). Based on the these insights, this paper proposes the Black- Box Tuning (BBT) to solve various language understand- ing tasks by only accessing the PTM inference API. In particular, we manage to optimize the continuous prompt prepended to the input text by iteratively querying the PTM inference API, as brieÔ¨Çy depicted in Figure 1. To han- dle the high dimensionality of the continuous prompt, we project the original prompt space using a random linear projection onto a much smaller subspace and solve this optimization problem with some derivative-free optimizer in that smaller subsapce. In contrast to conventional Ô¨Åne- tuning methods that can only be performed by the service side, black-box tuning allows users to optimize their task- speciÔ¨Åc prompts locally on resource-limited devices (even without GPUs). Our experimental results demonstrate that prompting RoBERTaLARGE (Liu et al., 2019) using BBT on 3Also termed as black-box, zeroth-order or gradient-free opti- mization. a few labeled samples not only outperforms manual prompt and in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020), but also out- performs its gradient-based counterparts, namely prompt tuning (Lester et al., 2021) and full model tuning. The contribution of this paper is three folds:4 ‚Ä¢ This paper proposes a novel scenario (LMaaS) where one should learn to prompt the PTMs by only accessing their inference APIs. ‚Ä¢ This paper offers a solution (BBT) for such a scenario to accomplish common language understanding tasks without access to model parameters and gradients, such that large-scale PTMs can better beneÔ¨Åt users. ‚Ä¢ Empirical results show that DFO can successfully deal with real-world language tasks by learning to prompt large-scale PTMs with more than millions of parame- ters. Thus, this work pioneers the work of optimizing large-scale PTMs through DFO methods. 2. Background Large-Scale PTMs as APIs. It is a promising way to de- ploy large-scale PTMs to serve downstream applications by providing general-purpose APIs. For the service side, wrapping the computation of the PTM into an easy-to-use API has become a common practice (Brown et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2021). In contrast to training, the in- ference speed of large-scale PTMs can be highly optimized with acceleration techniques such as ORT and TensorRT. In addition, large-scale PTMs are often not open-sourced due to the commercial reasons and the potential risk of mis- use. For the user side , even if the large-scale PTMs are available, it is expensive or even infeasible to locally run them. Thus, how to exploit the PTM inference API to solve conventional language tasks is a promising direction. Intrinsic Dimensionality of PTMs. The intrinsic dimen- sionality of an objective function is the minimum number of parameters needed to obtain satisfactory solutions (Li et al., 2018). In particular, the intrinsic dimensionality in- dicates the lowest dimensional reparameterization that is as effective for optimizing as the full parameter space. Li et al. (2018) propose to measure the intrinsic dimensionality of neural networks by Ô¨Ånding the minimal dimensionality of the subspace that is randomly projected from the full trainable parameters, in which they can optimize the neural networks to achieve satisfactory solutions. Aghajanyan et al. (2021) empirically show that large-scale pre-training implic- itly compresses the intrinsic dimensionality of downstream NLP tasks. By tuning only hundreds of parameters that 4Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ txsun1997/Black-Box-TuningBlack-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service are then randomly projected onto the full parameter space of RoBERTa, they can achieve 90% performance relative to full model tuning. Qin et al. (2021) show that intrinsic subspace on various tasks can be compressed to less than 100 dimensions with multi-task supervision. This line of research, along with the work of parameter-efÔ¨Åcient tun- ing (Houlsby et al., 2019; Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2021a; He et al., 2021), demonstrate that PTMs can well adapt to downstream tasks by tuning a very small proportion of parameters, which im- plies the possibility of optimizing large-scale PTMs with derivative-free algorithms. Prompt-Based Learning. Prompt-based learning is to formulate downstream tasks as a (masked) language mod- eling task, and therefore reduces the gap between PTM pre-training and Ô¨Åne-tuning (Brown et al., 2020; Schick & Sch¬®utze, 2021a;b; Gao et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2022). For instance, one can use BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) to predict whether the sentence ‚ÄùThis is a fantastic movie‚Äù is positive or negative by appending the prompt ‚ÄùIt was [MASK]‚Äù and see if BERT predicts ‚Äùgreat‚Äù or ‚Äùterrible‚Äù at the masked position. Note that the prompt is not necessarily discrete, it can also be optimized efÔ¨Åciently in continuous space with gradient descent (Li & Liang, 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2021; Qin & Eisner, 2021; Liu et al., 2021b; Zhong et al., 2021). In the case of only tuning the continuous prompt while keeping the parameters of large PTMs untouched, one can retain the efÔ¨Åcient serving beneÔ¨Åts while matching the performance of full model tuning (Lester et al., 2021). Our work also proposes to optimize the continuous prompt while keeping the PTM parameters unchanged, but without gradient descent. Derivative-Free Optimization. Derivative-free optimiza- tion (DFO) realizes optimization only via the function val- ues f(x) on the sampled solutions x. Most DFO algorithms share a common structure of sampling-and-updating to en- hance the quality of solutions. Representative DFO algo- rithms include evolutionary algorithms (Hansen et al., 2003), Bayesian optimization (Shahriari et al., 2016), etc. Due to their ability of addressing complex optimization tasks, DFO algorithms have achieved many impressive applica- tions in automatic machine learning (Snoek et al., 2012), reinforcement learning (Salimans et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2017), objective detection (Zhang et al., 2015b), etc. 3. Approach 3.1. Problem Formulation Common language understanding tasks can be formulated as a classiÔ¨Åcation task, which is to predict for a batch of input texts X the labels Y. To solve the target language understanding task with a general-purpose PTM, we should modify X with some template (e.g., adding some trigger words and a special token [MASK] for BERT-like PTMs) and map the labels Y to some words in the PTM vocab- ulary (e.g., the sentiment label ‚Äùpositive‚Äù can be mapped to ‚Äùgreat‚Äù). The modiÔ¨Åed inputs and labels are denoted as ÀúX and ÀúY. Assume the BERT-like PTM inference API f takes a continuous prompt p and a batch of modiÔ¨Åed texts ÀúX as input, and outputs the logits on the masked positions, i.e., ÀÜY = f(p; ÀúX). With the output logits, we can calculate the loss on this batch of data, which is not necessarily to be differentiable. Our goal is to Ô¨Ånd the optimal prompt p‚ãÜ = arg minp‚ààPL(f(p; ÀúX),ÀúY), where Pis some search space of interest and Lis some loss function such as nega- tive accuracy. The black-box function f is not available to the optimizer in closed form, but can be evaluated at a query point (p; ÀúX). 3.2. Black-Box Tuning As demonstrated by Lester et al. (2021), dozens of prompt to- kens are required to obtain a competitive performance when only tuning continuous prompts. Given that the embedding dimensionality of large-scale PTMs is usually larger than one thousand (e.g., the word embeddings of RoBERTaLARGE are 1024-dimensional), the dimensionality of the continuous prompt p ‚ààRD that we are interested to optimize can be tens of thousands, which makes derivative-free optimization intractable. To handle this high-dimensional optimization, since large-scale PTMs have a low intrinsic dimensional- ity (Aghajanyan et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2021), we manage to optimize z ‚ààRd in a much smaller subspace (d‚â™D), and use a random projection matrix A ‚ààRD√ód to project z on the original prompt space P. Note that directly projecting z onto the prompt space that is compatible with the PTM is non-trivial. To ease the optimization, we instead optimize the increment of some initial prompt p0. For simplicity, we randomly sample n tokens from the PTM vocabulary as initialization. Thus, our objective becomes z‚ãÜ = arg min z‚ààZ L(f(Az + p0; ÀúX),ÀúY) , (1) where Zis the search space. Previous work (Wang et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2016; Letham et al., 2020) in derivative- free optimization usually sets each entry in the random matrix A by sampling from some normal distribution. How- ever, this sampling strategy does not perform well in our scenario. Instead, we set values of the random matrix A by sampling from a uniform distribution adopted in He et al. (2015) (cf. Appendix A for the comparison). We restrict the search space to Z= [‚àí5,5]d. For the loss functionL, a straightforward alternative is using negative accuracy. However, the reward of accuracy can beBlack-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service Best film ever . It was <MASK> . A totally boring movie ! It was <MASK> . You 'll probably love it .

Given z ‚ààRd provided by the derivative-free optimizer, we project it to the prompt space by a random matrix A ‚ààRD√ód. By adding the projected prompt embeddings Az with some initial prompt embeddings p0 (in this illustration are the embeddings of tokens randomly sampled from the PTM‚Äôs vocabulary), we obtain the Ô¨Ånal prompt embeddings that are then concatenated with the input texts ÀúX. By calling the black-box API f, which implements the forward computation of the PTM, the predictions on the masked positions are obtained, i.e., ÀÜY = f(p; ÀúX). With the prediction ÀÜY and the golden labels ÀúY at hand, we can calculate the loss that is used by the derivative-free optimizer to suggest a new z. sparse and less informative, especially when training data is limited. Thus, we also consider two loss functions that are more sensitive to predictions, i.e., cross entropy and hinge loss. Given the output logits ÀÜ yover a candidate set of label words, and the golden label word Àúyof a certain sample, the cross entropy is deÔ¨Åned as LCE(ÀÜ y,Àúy) =‚àílog SoftmaxÀúy(ÀÜ y). (2) For hinge loss, we adopt a multi-class extension (Weston & Watkins, 1999), LHinge(ÀÜ y,Àúy) = ‚àë iÃ∏=Àúy max(0,Œ≥ + ÀÜ yi ‚àíÀÜ yÀúy). (3) In this work we set the margin Œ≥ = 2. The performances of using cross entropy, hinge loss, and negative accuracy are compared in Figure 3. 3.3. The CMA Evolution Strategy As demonstrated in Aghajanyan et al. (2021), the intrinsic dimensionality of PTMs like RoBERTa LARGE on various tasks can be hundreds. To handle optimization of such scale, we adopt the CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evo- lution Strategy) (Hansen & Ostermeier, 2001; Hansen et al., 2003), which is a widely used evolutionary algorithm for non-convex black-box optimization in continuous domain. In particular, CMA-ES maintains a parameterized search distribution model, i.e., multivariate normal distribution. In each iteration, CMA-ES samples a population of new query solutions (also referred to as individuals or offspring) from the multivariate normal distribution model z(t+1) i ‚àºm(t) + œÉ(t)N(0,C(t)) , (4) where i= 1,...,Œª and Œªis the population size. m(t) ‚ààRd is the mean vector of the search distribution at iteration step t, œÉ(t) ‚ààR+ is the overall standard deviation that controls the step length, and C(t) ‚ààRd√ód is the covariance matrix that determines the shape of the distribution ellipsoid. By maximizing the likelihood of successful steps, m(t), œÉ(t), C(t) are updated (cf. Hansen (2016) for more details). 3.4. Pre-Training Prompt Embedding Considering that sentence-pair tasks can share the same template and label words, as shown in Table 1, we can pre- train a prompt embedding p0 on some publicly available NLI task (in our experiments we use the MNLI (Williams et al., 2018) training set) for a better initialization. For other classiÔ¨Åcation tasks we set p0 as word embeddings randomly drawn from the vocabulary of RoBERTaLARGE. 4. Experiments 4.1. Setup Dataset. We conduct experiments on several common language understanding tasks including sentiment analy- sis, topic classiÔ¨Åcation, natural language inference (NLI),Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service Table 1.Statistics, manual templates, and label words used in our experiments. |Y| : number of classes.

For sentiment analysis, we choose SST- 2 (Socher et al., 2013) and Yelp polarity (Zhang et al., 2015a). For topic classiÔ¨Åcation, we choose AG‚Äôs News and DBPedia (Zhang et al., 2015a). For NLI, we choose SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015) and RTE (Wang et al., 2019). For paraphrase, we choose MRPC (Dolan & Brockett, 2005). The statistics, manual templates and label words of these datasets are shown in Table 1. Few-Shot Setting. For a broad range of users, the amount of labeled data can be limited, in which case they can resort to the deployed large PTMs due to their great power of few- shot learning (Brown et al., 2020). Hence, in this paper we conduct experiments in the few-shot setting. We randomly select ksamples for each class to construct a k-shot training set Dtrain, and compose a development set Ddev by randomly drawing another ksamples from the original training set and ensure that |Dtrain|= |Ddev|to simulate the true few-shot learning setting (Perez et al., 2021). Following Zhang et al. (2021a), Gao et al. (2021), and Gu et al. (2021), we use the original development sets as the test sets. For datasets with- out development sets, we use the original test sets. Hence, in our experiments |Dtest|‚â´|D train|= |Ddev|. Backbone Model. We choose RoBERTaLARGE (Liu et al., 2019) as our backbone model because: (1) We mainly fo- cus on language understanding tasks; (2) Aghajanyan et al. (2021) have demonstrated that RoBERTaLARGE has a very small intrinsic dimensionality (about hundreds) on many tasks. It is worth noting that generative PTMs such as GPT (Brown et al., 2020), T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) and BART (Lewis et al., 2020) are also compatible with our framework if we convert downstream tasks into a uniÔ¨Åed text-to-text format. We leave for future work the applica- tions of generative PTMs. Baselines. We compare our proposed black-box tuning with two kinds of methods: gradient-based methods and gradient-free methods. For gradient-based methods, we consider three baselines: (1) Prompt Tuning: Following Lester et al. (2021), we only train the continuous prompts Table 2.Default conÔ¨Åguration of hyper-parameters. Hyper-parameter Default Prompt length (L) 50 Subspace dimension (d) 500 Population size (Œª) 20 Random projection (A) Uniform Loss functionL Cross Entropy Budget (# of API calls) 8000 prepended to the input texts while keeping the PTM frozen. We use an Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015) with learn- ing rate of 5e-4 and batch size of 16 for 1000 epochs. For fair comparison, we use the same prompt length, manual template, label words, and the same pre-trained prompt em- bedding for initialization on sentence-pair tasks as black-box tuning. (2) P-Tuning v2 (Liu et al., 2021a) is an improved variant of prompt tuning. Instead of injecting continuous prompts merely into the input layer, P-Tuning v2 prepends and optimizes continuous prompts at every layer of the PTM. We optimize the prompts of length 128 at each layer using an Adam optimizer with learning rate of 5e-4 and batch size of 32 for 2000 epochs. (3) Model Tuning: We Ô¨Åne-tune the entire PTM on each task using an Adam optimizer with learning rate of 1e-5 and batch size of 16 for 200 epochs. For gradient-free methods, we consider three baselines: (1) Manual Prompt: We directly use the templates and label words in Table 1 to conduct zero-shot evaluation. The re- sults of manual prompt can be seen as initial points of our method. (2) In-context Learning: Following Brown et al. (2020), we randomly select up to 32 training samples and concatenate them with the input texts. (3) Feature-based Methods: Feature-based methods (Peters et al., 2019) is also a competitive baseline for LMaaS, where one can re- quest the features encoded by the large PTM and locally train a classiÔ¨Åer to accomplish the task of interest. Here we consider two implementations: (a) Feature-MLP: We train a two-layered MLP classiÔ¨Åer on the [CLS] representation of the PTM. (b) Feature-BiLSTM: We train a bidirectional LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) on the repre- sentations of the sequence of tokens, followed by a linear classiÔ¨Åer on the top. For both implementations of feature-Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service based methods, we use an Adam optimizer with learning rate of 3e-4 and batch size of 16 to train the attached clas- siÔ¨Åers for 1000 epochs. For black-box tuning, we give in Table 2 the default conÔ¨Åguration of hyper-parameters used in our experiments. The effect of each hyper-parameter is explored in ¬ß 4.3. 4.2. Results Overall Comparison. We Ô¨Årst demonstrate the experi- mental results of black-box tuning and the baselines across 7 datasets in Table 3. The proposed black-box tuning sig- niÔ¨Åcantly outperforms the other four gradient-free methods. We observe that in-context learning performs even worse than manual prompt on some tasks, and suffers from high variance. That means, in-context learning cannot effectively utilize labeled samples included in the context. Feature- based methods perform slightly better than manual prompt and in-context learning. Meanwhile, Feature-BiLSTM out- performs Feature-MLP due to its advantage of using more informative features. Surprisingly, black-box tuning also outperforms its gradient-based counterparts, namely prompt tuning, p-tuning v2, and model tuning, on average perfor- mance of the 7 tasks. Note that the only difference between prompt tuning and black-box tuning is whether we use gra- dient descent (i.e., Adam optimizer) or DFO algorithm (i.e., CMA-ES). Based on the experimental results, we suspect that gradient-based optimization tends to overÔ¨Åt the small training data while DFO tends to Ô¨Ånd better solutions due to its exploration mechanism. In addition, we Ô¨Ånd that model tuning performs much better than prompt tuning and black- box tuning when number of classes is large (e.g., DBPedia). On NLI tasks (i.e., SNLI and RTE), when using pre-trained prompt embedding (¬ß 3.4), prompt tuning and black-box tuning signiÔ¨Åcantly outperform model tuning, which also conÔ¨Årms the effectiveness of prompt pre-training (Gu et al., 2021) in the context of black-box tuning. Detailed Comparison. In the scenario of LMaaS, there are many other factors to be considered. In Table 4 we com- pare black-box tuning and the baseline methods in terms of deployment efÔ¨Åciency, viability of as-a-service, training time, memory usage on the user side and the server side, and the amount of data to be uploaded and downloaded. Model tuning is not deployment-efÔ¨Åcient because it needs to main- tain a copy of the entire model for each user. Gradient-based methods cannot make the PTM serve as a service due to the requirement of gradients. Feature-based methods and black-box tuning are suitable for LMaaS. However, feature- based methods cannot achieve competitive results when labeled data is limited. Therefore, among all the considered methods, only black-box tuning can achieve satisfactory performance while maintaining reasonable training time, memory footprint, and network load. Unlike gradient-based methods, in which the optimization cost is proportional to the size of the PTM, the optimization cost of black-box tuning is decoupled from the scale of the PTM, and only relies on the subspace dimensionality. For fair compari- son of training time, we perform early stopping for all the compared methods, i.e., we stop learning if the development accuracy does not increase after 1000 steps. All the methods are implemented with PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019) and ex- perimented on a single NVIDIA GTX 3090 GPU. Note that the process of model inference can be further accelerated via better implementations (e.g., using ONNX and TensorRT). In Table 4 we also report the training time of black-box tuning using ONNX Runtime. Detailed calculation of the amount of data to be uploaded/downloaded can be found in Appendix C. 4.3. Ablation Study In this section, we conduct ablation experiments on various hyper-parameters. To control experimental variables, we explore the effect of each hyper-parameter while keeping the other hyper-parameters as default as listed in Table 2. To stablize the experimental results and reduce the variance over different runs, we conduct ablation experiments in 64- shot setting. Each run is performed on the same data split with different random seeds. Experimental results of abla- tions on loss functions L, subspace dimensionality d, and prompt length Lare demonstrated in Figure 3. Additional ablation studies on the effect of the random projection A, the effect of the population size Œª, and the ablations in the 16-shot setting are in Appendix A. For each ablation, we show results under different budget, which is measured by the number of PTM inference API calls. In each API call, one can provide a continuous prompt p and query the results of the PTM forward computation on a batch of training data. In our few-shot setting, we can put all the training data into one batch, and therefore the objective function to be optimized is deterministic instead of stochastic. CMA-ES vs. Adam. We compare our used derivative- free optimizer, CMA-ES, with a competitive Ô¨Årst-order opti- mizer, Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015). For fair comparison, we update the continuous prompt using Adam with the gra- dients over the entire training data (i.e., batch size equals to |Dtrain|). We use learning rate of 1e-3 for Adam opti- mizer. As shown in the top row of Figure 3, Adam optimizer achieves faster convergence on both SST-2 and AG‚Äôs News due to the gradients it used. On the development sets, Adam performs slight worse than CMA-ES with cross entropy on SST-2 but better on AG‚Äôs News. But as demonstrated in Ta- ble 3, using Adam optimizer performs worse than CMA-ES on the average performance across seven task test sets.Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service Table 3.Overall comparison on various language understanding tasks. We report mean and standard deviation of performance over 3 different splits (¬ß 4.1). All of the results are obtained with pre-trained RoBERTaLARGE in 16-shot (per class) setting.

We consider three loss functions: cross entropy, hinge loss, and negative accuracy. As depicted in the top row of Figure 3, cross entropy and hinge loss signif- icantly outperform the negative accuracy. In the few-shot setting, the accuracy as a reward can be sparse, and cannot provide informative directions for optimization. On SST- 2 and AG‚Äôs News, we obtain that cross entropy performs slightly better than hinge loss. Subspace Dimensionality. The subspace of dimensional- ity dis the space where the optimization actually performs. According to the intrinsic dimensionality found in Agha- janyan et al. (2021), we explore the subspace dimensionality of {100, 200, 500, 1000}within the budget of {2k, 4k, 6k, 8k}. Accordingly, we set population size Œª= 4 + 3 log(d). As shown in the middle row of Figure 3, the best subspace dimensionality can be different on different tasks (d= 200 performs the best on SST-2 development set and d= 500 performs the best on AG‚Äôs News development set), which is related to the observation that intrinsic dimensionality varies across different tasks (Aghajanyan et al., 2021). In general, a small subspace (e.g., d= 100) is hard to cover a good solution, while a large subspace (e.g., d= 1000) may lead to poor generalization. Prompt Length. Prompt length L determines the di- mensionality of the original parameter space (in our case D= L√ó1024). We evaluate black-box tuning under each budget in {2k, 4k, 6k, 8k}while varying the prompt length in {10, 20, 50, 100}. As shown in the bottom row of Fig- ure 3, shorter prompt confers faster convergence on the training sets but does not yield better generalization on the development sets.

We show mean and standard deviation of performance over 3 runs with different random seeds. Ablations of the random projection and the population size can be found in Appendix A. 5. Discussion and Future Work In this section we discuss our proposed method in the con- text of (1) derivative-free optimization and (2) prompt-based learning, respectively. By drawing comparisons with these two lines of research, we highlight some directions that could improve this work in future. Comparison with Previous Derivative-Free Approaches. Our proposed method lies in the same framework of previ- ous work that solves high-dimensional derivative-free op- timization problems via random embedding (Wang et al., 2016). In contrast, we set the random embedding A by sampling from a uniform distribution instead of normal dis- tributions, and use the CMA-ES to perform optimization in the generated subspace. In previous work, the target black- box functions are usually synthetic functions where only a few dimensions can affect the function values, and therefore most of the dimensions are strictly non-effective. In our real- world scenario, the intrinsic dimension can be approximate. In the context of PTMs, a more appropriate substitution for the term intrinsic dimensionality can be œµ-effective dimen- sionality (Qian et al., 2016). Considering the relaxation to the intrinsic dimensionality of PTMs, more suitable ap- proaches such as sequential random embedding (Qian et al., 2016) and other more advanced methods of constructing the random projection matrix (Letham et al., 2020) should be explored in future work. Besides, the subspace generated by random projection can be sub-optimal. As demonstrated in Qin et al. (2021), training the projection A with multi- task supervision can result in better and smaller subspace. Besides, larger PTMs generally have lower intrinsic dimen- sionalities (Aghajanyan et al., 2021), as a result, we can use smaller subspace and more efÔ¨Åcient DFO algorithms such as Bayesian optimization on larger PTMs. Comparison with Previous Prompt-Based Learning Ap- proaches. From the perspective of prompt-based learning, our method is similar to prompt-tuning (Lester et al., 2021), where only the continuous prompt prepended to the input text is tuned, so our method also retains the beneÔ¨Åts of efÔ¨Å- cient serving and mixed-task inference. In addition to the continuous prompt, we also insert some hard prompt tokens (e.g., ‚ÄùIt was [MASK]‚Äù) in the input text, which has been demonstrated to be effective in previous work (Gu et al., 2021) in the name of hybrid prompt tuning. Different from previous prompt-based learning approaches, our prompt tun-Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service ing does not require backpropagation and gradient descent. Considering our used templates and label words are hand- crafted without trial-and-error, the performance reported in this paper is just a lower bound. More advanced techniques such as prompt engineering (Gao et al., 2021), label words engineering (Schick et al., 2020; Shin et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2021b), prompt pre-training (Gu et al., 2021), and prompt ensembling (Lester et al., 2021) are orthogonal to this work and therefore can further improve the performance. For simplicity, we do not integrate these methods and leave for future work.

Additional Experimental Results Random Projection. The random projection matrix A ‚ààRD√ód is a key factor that determines whether and how hard it is to Ô¨Ånd a good solution in the generated subspace. Here we compare two design choices of setting A: The Ô¨Årst choice is commonly used in previous high-dimensional derivative-free optimization work (Wang et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2016), that is setting each entry of A by sampling from a normal distribution. Following Qian et al. (2016), we use N(0,1/d) where d is the subspace dimensionality5. The second choice is setting each entry of A by sampling from a uniform distribution, which is widely used for initializing linear layers in modern neural networks. Here we use the uniform distribution proposed in He et al. (2015). As shown in Figure 4, both random projections can achieve a considerable cross entropy loss on SST-2 and AG‚Äôs News within reasonable budgets but faster convergence is obtained using uniform distribution. 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Number of API calls 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40Cross Entropy Loss SST-2 Normal Uniform 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Number of API calls 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8Cross Entropy Loss AG's News Normal Uniform Figure 4.Effect of random projection A. Population Size. In each iteration of the CMA-ES, a population of solutions are sampled from a multivariate normal distribution model. The evaluation of the population is then used to update the parameters of the multivariate normal distribution model. Here we study the effect of the population size on SST-2. In our experiments, we sequentially evaluate each solution in a population, and therefore larger population size will result in more API calls given the same CMA-ES iterations. As shown in Figure 5, smaller population size confers faster convergence in terms of number of API calls. We also demonstrate the comparison in terms of the CMA-ES iterations, which can be found in the following section. 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Number of API calls 82.5 85.0 87.5 90.0 92.5 95.0 97.5 100.0Train accuracy (current best) SST-2 (train) Pop. size=5 Pop. size=10 Pop. size=15 Pop. size=20 Pop. size=25 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 Number of API calls 84 86 88 90 92 94Dev accuracy (current best) SST-2 (dev) Pop. size=5 Pop. size=10 Pop. size=15 Pop. size=20 Pop. size=25 Figure 5.Effect of population size Œª. 5We also tried N(0,1) as used in Wang et al.

Ablation of Subspace Dimensionality and Prompt Length in 16-shot Setting. In ¬ß 4.3, we conduct ablation experi- ments in the 64-shot setting to reduce the variance over different runs. To keep consistent with the experimental setting in Table 3, we demonstrate in Figure 6 the ablation results on subspace dimensionality and prompt length in the 16-shot setting. CMA-ES vs. Adam in Subspaces. In Figure 3, we compare the convergence of prompt tuning (with Adam optimizer) and black-box tuning (with CMA-ES), where Adam performs optimization in the original prompt space (P) while CMA-ES performs in the generated subsapce (Z). Here we also compare the effectiveness and efÔ¨Åciency of Adam and CMA-ES in subspaces. As shown in Figure 7, CMA-ES is more efÔ¨Åcient and stable than Adam in low-dimensional subspaces. When the dimensionality of the subsapce becomes large (e.g., d= 1000), Adam with a appropriate learning rate can perform on par with CMA-ES. Note that CMA-ES does not require back-propagation, so the computation cost of one iteration for CMA-ES and Adam can be very different. For fair comparison, we convert the number of iterations into FLOPs. The FLOPs of one iteration of Adam is estimated to be three times greater than CMA-ES. B. Parallel Evaluation If the training data is smaller, or the server allows larger batches, a promising way to improve training efÔ¨Åciency is to use parallel evaluation. That is, we can evaluate the entire population in parallel, as depicted in Figure 8(a). As demonstrated in Figure 8(b), we can achieve 100% accuracy on the SST-2 training set with population size of 20 and 25 in 300 iterations (API calls). In case of the batch size per API call is limited, we can also use asynchronous queries to simulate the parallel evaluation. C. Estimation of Uploaded/Downloaded Data Size In this section we describe how we estimate the amount of data to be uploaded and downloaded (Table 4). For black-box tuning, there are two kinds of data to be uploaded: (1) training samples, and (2) continuous prompt. A training sample is comprised of two parts: input ids and attention mask. We can use the unsigned short (representation range: 0‚àº65535, 2 bytes per value) for input ids and use the bool type (1 byte per value) for attention mask. For continuous prompt, which contains hundreds of values, we can use the Ô¨Çoat type (4 bytes per value) for representation.Black-Box Tuning for Language-Model-as-a-Service Serial Evaluation Population Logits Data Parallel Evaluation (a) 0 100 200 300 Iterations of CMA-ES 82.5 85.0 87.5 90.0 92.5 95.0 97.5 100.0Train accuracy (current best) SST-2 (train) Pop. size=5 Pop. size=10 Pop. size=15 Pop. size=20 Pop. size=25 (b) Figure 8.(a) Illustration of the parallel evaluation. (b) Comparison of the convergence rate with different population sizes using parallel evaluation. Take SST-2 16-shot split as an example, the input ids and attention mask are in shape of 32 √ó47, where 32 is the batch size and 47 is the maximum sequence length, so there are ‚àº2.9KB data for input ids and ‚àº1.5KB data for attention mask. Assume the prompt is 500-dimensional, we need to upload additional ‚àº2KB data for prompt. The data to be downloaded is the output logits of the candidate words, which is a dictionary containing |Y| Ô¨Çoat values. Take SST-2 16-shot split as an example, the size of data to be downloaded is32 √ó2 √ó4bytes = 0.25KB. For feature-based methods we use similar estimation methods. The data size for upload is the same for Feature-MLP and Feature-BiLSTM. The data to be downloaded for Feature-MLP is the representation of the [CLS] token while the data to be downloaded for Feature-BiLSTM is the representation of all the tokens. Note that this estimation, without any data compression, is an upper bound of the real scenario.",

PT stands out from other PEFT approaches because it maintains competitive perfor- mance with fewer trainable parameters and does not drastically scale up its param- eters as the model size expands.

PT increases the length of the input sequence, leading to much greater com- putational demands during train and inference phrases. Fine-tuning (FT) language models (LMs) (Raffel et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023) on downstream tasks of- fers large performance improvements across various natural language pro- cessing (NLP) tasks, but it requires updating and storing full parameters of the LMs (see Figure 1a), which is especially expensive when LMs con- tain hundreds of millions or even bil- lions of parameters. Prompt engineering (Brown et al., 2020) does not update any parameters while it is typically hard to design and has a high-performance variance (Wang et al., 2023a) (see Fig- ure 1c). Consequently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches (Liu et al., 2022) have attracted growing interest, aiming to learn only a small number of parameters per task while main- taining performance levels comparable to full fine-tuning. Prompt Tuning (PT) (Lester et al., 2021) has emerged as a promising PEFT approach, which ap- pends trainable continuous prompt vectors to the input (see Figure 1b). PT stands out from other PEFT approaches as it maintains competitive performance with fewer trainable parameters and does not drastically scale up its trainable parameters as the model size expands. Recent works suggest that the majority of the LM‚Äôs knowledge is acquired during its pretraining phase (Zhou et al., 2023), and 1 arXiv:2309.05173v5  [cs.CL]  18 Feb 2024Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 that in-context learning (ICL) with just a few carefully designed stylistic examples and a carefully designed system prompt can achieve impressive alignment results (Lin et al., 2023). Considering scenarios where tasks have already been somewhat understood by LMs and the key challenge is just to properly prompt the LMs, PT emerges as a potentially better option to other PEFT approaches. While PT has shown promising results across various tasks and models, it has two major limitations: (1) PT often suffers from slow convergence and is sensitive to the initialization (Lester et al., 2021; Vu et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023b); and (2) PT extends the total length of the input sequence, consequently exacerbating the computation demand (i.e., train/inference time and memory cost), due to the quadratic complexity of the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). This is further accentuated given the slow convergence issue. Recent studies (Su et al., 2022; Vu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022) have proposed the variants of the vanilla PT to tackle the first issue by initially pre-training soft prompts on a variety of source tasks, which is known as Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL), as depicted in Figure 2a. Some studies (Asai et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023b) also improve the performance of the PT by jointly training learned prompts from these source tasks on multiple target tasks (referred to asMulti-task Learning). However, the issue of increased computational load due to the extension of sequence length remains largely unaddressed. While PETL approaches can reduce the training steps for model convergence, each optimization step remains computationally expensive in terms of time and memory. Most importantly, it does not enhance the efficiency during the inference phase, which is particularly crucial in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), considering that the trained models may be queried millions of times per day.

DEPT decomposes a trainable soft prompt of the vanilla PT into a shorter soft prompt and a couple of low-rank matrices, where the multiplication of low-rank matrices serves to update frozen word embedding. In this work, we propose Decomposed Prompt Tuning (DEPT), which decomposes a train- able soft prompt into a shorter soft prompt and a couple of low-rank matrices, where the multiplication of low-rank matrices is then added element-wise to frozen word em- beddings, as shown in Figure 2b (¬ß2.2). This shorter soft prompt and the updated word embedding matrix are then optimised using two different learning rates - a crucial step for model convergence (¬ß3.4). The intuition of this design is to enable representation updates within the frozen word embedding, thereby increasing the adaptability of input representations that were previously unavailable. Experimental results on 23 natural language processing (NLP) and vision-language (VL) tasks demonstrate D EPT outper- forms the state-of-the-art PEFT approaches, including the full fine-tuning baseline in certain scenarios (¬ß3.2). Our study empirically shows that D EPT largely improves the training efficiency across various model architectures and sizes, saving more than 20% (using T5- BASE ) in both training time and memory costs compared to the vanilla PT. Importantly, D EPT becomes increasingly efficient as the model size grows, making it particularly advantageous and suitable for LLMs (¬ß3.3). Furthermore, our additional analysis in the few-shot learning setting reveals the DEPT‚Äôs compatibility with PETL approaches (¬ß3.4). In summary, the main contributions of this paper are as follows: ‚Ä¢ We propose D EPT method, which addresses a key efficiency limitation of Prompt Tuning by decomposing its soft prompt to reduce input sequence length. D EPT largely improves the training and inference efficiency, in terms of both time and memory costs; ‚Ä¢ Our comprehensive evaluation on 23 NLP and VL tasks demonstrates that D EPT outper- forms state-of-the-art PEFT approaches, including the full fine-tuning in some scenarios. 2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 Additionally, our experiments show that DEPT smoothly integrates with PETL approaches and the advantage of DEPT persists in the few-shot learning setting; ‚Ä¢ We empirically show that D EPT becomes increasingly efficient as the model size grows, making it particularly well-suited for LLMs. Furthermore, D EPT is orthogonal to various PEFT approaches ( i.e., Adapter, LoRA) and can be easily combined together. 2 M ETHOD In this section, we first revisit background of Prompt Tuning (PT) in ¬ß2.1 and then introduce our proposed method, Decomposed Prompt Tuning (DEPT) in ¬ß2.2. 2.1 B ACKGROUND : P ROMPT TUNING (PT) Let L ‚âú {xi, yi}N i=1 denote N labelled training data for the target task T . Given a backbone model parameterised by Œò, each input text xi is mapped into a sequence of word embeddingsWi ‚àà Rs√ód, where s and d represent the maximum sequence length and the dimension of word embeddings. PT appends a trainable prompt matrix P ‚àà Rl√ód to the frozen word embedding matrix Wi, where l is a hyper-parameter for the number of virtual tokens. The soft prompt P can be initialised either randomly or by sampling word embeddings from the vocabulary. Consequently, the model‚Äôs input becomes the combined matrix [P; Wi] ‚àà R(l+s)√ód. The targeted loss function is formulated as: LPT = ‚àí X i log P(yi |[P, Wi] ; Œò), (1) where the loss function is only optimised with respect to the soft prompt matrix P. 2.2 O UR APPROACH : D ECOMPOSED PROMPT TUNING (DEPT) The decomposition of the soft prompt. DEPT differs from the vanilla PT method in the aspect of inputs. As shown in Figure 2b, we decompose a trainable prompt matrixP ‚àà Rl√ód from the vanilla PT into two components: (1) a shorter trainable prompt matrix Ps ‚àà Rm√ód; and (2) a pair of low- rank matrices, A ‚àà Rs√ór and B ‚àà Rr√ód, where typically the rank of the matrices r ‚â™ min(s, d). The first component, the smaller trainable prompt matrix, is appended to the word embedding matrix in a similar manner as in the vanilla PT. The second component uses the multiplication of two low- rank matrices to represent the update of the word embedding through a coordinate-wise sum: W ‚Ä≤ i = Wi + ‚àÜWi = Wi + BA ‚àà Rs√ód, (2) where Wi is frozen and does not receive gradient updates during the training, whereasA and B are trainable. Following Hu et al. (2021), we use a random Gaussian initialization forA and zero for B, so ‚àÜW = BA is zero when the training starts. The loss function is then optimised as follows: LDEPT = ‚àí X i log P(yi |[Ps, W ‚Ä≤ i ] ; Œò) (3) In our experiment, we choose the values ofm and r to satisfy the equationl√ód = m√ód+(s+d)√ór for maintaining the exact size of trainable parameters as in the vanilla PT. Consequently,m is always less than l when r >0. This design improves memory efficiency and reduces computational expense compared to the vanilla PT, as the shorter input sequence length ( i.e., m + s < l+ s) substantially reduces computation due to the quadratic complexity of the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Two rates of learning. DEPT also differs from the vanilla PT in training. We train the shorter trainable prompt matrix, Ps, with the learning rate Œ±1 and the pair of low-rank matrices, A and B, with the learning rate Œ±2, rather than use a single learning rate as in the vanilla PT. The Œ±1 is typically much larger than theŒ±2. We will empirically validate the importance of this choice in ¬ß3.4. However, DEPT may introduces extra training costs for the hyperparameter optimization (see ¬ß5). 3 E XPERIMENTS AND RESULTS In this section, we introduce our experimental setup (see ¬ß3.1), evaluate the performance of D EPT across 23 different NLP and VL tasks (see ¬ß3.2), and assess relative train/inference time and mem- ory cost of DEPT (see ¬ß3.3), and explore the effectiveness of DEPT in the few-shot learning setting and importance of two different learning rates for training DEPT (see ¬ß3.4). 3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 3.1 E XPERIMENTAL SETUP Datasets and tasks. We evaluate our proposed method D EPT on 21 NLP tasks and 2 vision- language tasks. For NLP tasks, we follow the previous works (Vu et al., 2022; Sung et al., 2022b; Asai et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023b) and use various datasets sourced from: (1) GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark, including MNLI (Williams et al., 2018), QQP 1, QNLI (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), SST-2 (Socher et al., 2013), STS-B (Cer et al., 2017), MRPC (Dolan & Brockett, 2005), RTE (Giampiccolo et al., 2007) and CoLA (Warstadt et al., 2019); (2) SuperGLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019), including MultiRC (Khashabi et al., 2018), BoolQ (Clark et al., 2019), WiC (Pilehvar & Camacho-Collados, 2019), WSC (Levesque et al., 2012), and CB (De Marneffe et al., 2019); (3) MRQA 2019 Shared Task (Fisch et al., 2019), including Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), SearchQA (Dunn et al., 2017) and NewsQA (Trischler et al., 2017); (4) other datasets, including WinoGrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2021), Yelp-2 (Zhang et al., 2015), SciTail (Khot et al., 2018) and PAWS-Wiki (Zhang et al., 2019). For vision-language tasks, we follow prior works (Sung et al., 2022a;b) to experiment with the visual question-answering task, VQA (Goyal et al., 2017), and the image caption generation task, MSCOCO (Chen et al., 2015). Baselines. We compare DEPT with a variety of baselines: (1) fine-tuning (FT), where all the model parameters are tuned during adaptation on each downstream task; (2) the vanilla PT (Lester et al., 2021), where target prompt vectors are initialized by randomly sampled top vocabularies, and its variants using additional transfer and multi-task learning, including SPoT (Vu et al., 2022), AT- TEMPT (Asai et al., 2022), and MPT (Wang et al., 2023b); (3) state-of-the-art PEFT approaches including Adapters (Houlsby et al., 2019), AdapterDrop (R ¬®uckl¬¥e et al., 2021), BitFit (Ben Zaken et al., 2022), HyperFomer (Karimi Mahabadi et al., 2021), HyperDecoder (Ivison & Peters, 2022), P-tuning (Liu et al., 2021), LoRA (Hu et al., 2021), LST (Sung et al., 2022b), and their multi-task learning variants. For a fair comparison, we directly quote performance metrics from published pa- pers (Mahabadi et al., 2021; Karimi Mahabadi et al., 2021; Asai et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023b; Sung et al., 2022b) for a fair comparison, where all these baselines using the T5- BASE as the back- bone and adhere to the train, validation and test splits used by Karimi Mahabadi et al. (2021); Mahabadi et al. (2021) for NLP tasks and by Sung et al. (2022b) for vision-language tasks. Implementation details. In our study, we mainly experiment using the T5-BASE model with 220M parameters (Raffel et al., 2020). We consistently set the number of virtual tokens l as 100 across all tasks for the vanilla PT and adjust the hyper-parameters of D EPT accordingly to maintain the equivalent number of trainable parameters. For instance, the vanilla PT contains l √ó d trainable parameters where the hidden size d is 768 for the T5- BASE , and DEPT can configure the number of virtual tokens m as 40 and the rank of low matricesr as 45, resulting in m√ód+(s+d)√ór trainable parameters. This yields a total of 76, 800 trainable parameters, aligning with the vanilla PT. For VL tasks, we utilise the CLIP-T5 architecture which combines CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) and T5- BASE (Raffel et al., 2020), with the CLIP frozen. We follow the prior work (Sung et al., 2022b) to concatenate the visual representation from CLIP with the text embedding from the T5-BASE , where a trainable visual projection layer is used between CLIP and T5 to align the visual representation to the same dimension as the text embedding. We also extend our evaluation to include T5- SMALL (60M), T5- LARGE (770M), GPT2- SMALL (110M), GPT2- MEDIUM (345M), and GPT2- LARGE (774M) models. In the few-shot experiments, we randomly select k examples three times from the training set and report the mean and standard deviations for each k-shot experiment. Following the prior works in PETL for PT (Vu et al., 2022; Su et al., 2022; Asai et al., 2022), we use MNLI, QQP, SST-2, SQUAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), and ReCoRD (Zhang et al., 2018) as five source tasks. Our soft prompt and low-rank matrix pairs are initialized from the soft prompts derived from one of these selected source tasks. Please see more hyper-parameter and implementation details in Appendix ¬ßD. 3.2 M AIN RESULTS This section shows the empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of our proposed method DEPT across 23 NLP and VL tasks.

Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of DEPT using LLAMA -2 (Touvron et al., 2023) in Appendix ¬ßB. Experimental results reveal three key findings: (1) DEPT consistently outperforms the vanilla PT and its PETL variants; (2) DEPT achieves competitive or even better performance than state-of-the-art PEFT approaches while using fewer trainable parameters; and (3) D EPT falls short in some certain tasks. Below we delve deeper with respect to various tasks. #1. Performance on GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks. As shown in Table 1, our experi- mental result indicates that D EPT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT approaches, such as Adapter, LoRA and LST on the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks, while using fewer trainable parameters. Remarkably, DEPT also outperforms the full fine-tuning baseline on both benchmarks. In addition, DEPT outperforms vanilla PT and all the variants of PT that introduce additional transfer learning and multi-task learning. For example, ATTEMPT, which requires additional training for the soft prompt on the source tasks, achieves an average score of 83.4 on the GLUE benchmark and 70.5 on the SuperGLUE benchmark. Meanwhile, D EPT outperforms ATTEMPT with scores of 85.9 and 76.5 on GLUE and SuperGLUE, despite training fewer parameters. Similarly, DEPT surpasses MPT with 0.1% on the GLUE benchmark and 0.4% on the SuperGLUE benchmark, without utiliz- ing additional transfer learning or multi-task learning. These results are achieved with less inference time and reduced memory resources (refer to ¬ß3.3 for specifics), which validates the effectiveness of DEPT. As the PT often underperforms in scenarios with limited labelled data (Gu et al., 2022), we investigate the compatibility of DEPT and PETL later in the few-shot learning setting (¬ß3.4). #2. Performance on MRQA 2019 Shared Task and other NLP datasets. Table 2 presents the performance of various PEFT approaches, including D EPT, on the MRQA 2019 Shared Task and four other datasets. We observe that D EPT improves the average performance of the vanilla PT by a substantial margin of +3.6% on MRQA and +14.2% on the other datasets. D EPT exceeds the performance of the PT variants that leverage additional transfer and multi-task learning, without introducing extra trainable parameters to the vanilla PT or relying on any PETL approaches. While 5Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 Table 2: Test results on MRQA 2019 Shared Task and other datasets using the T5- BASE model.

Performance on Vision-Language tasks. Ta- ble 3 provides an overview of the performance of various PEFT approaches on two VL tasks, specifi- cally VQA and MS COCO Caption Generation. Re- sults show that D EPT, while updating much fewer parameters, achieves a CIDEr score of 113.7 on the MS COCO Caption Generation task, outperform- ing state-of-the-art PEFT approaches. This suggests the effectiveness of our proposed method. However, while DEPT outperforms methods such as P-tuning and BitFit on the VQA dataset, it still falls short of the full fine-tuning performance. This suggests that in certain tasks, the use of a greater number of train- able parameters could be beneficial. 3.3 T IME AND MEMORY EFFICIENCY This section shows the empirical evidence supporting the efficiency of DEPT, spanning over diverse model architectures of varying scales on the GLUE benchmark. To ensure a fair comparison, we consistently keep the number of trainable parameters in D EPT the same as that in the vanilla PT (l = 100). As a result, once we choose the length of the soft prompt m in D EPT, the rank of the low-rank matrices r becomes determined. In our experiments, we primarily compare D EPT with the vanilla PT using 5 different lengths of soft prompt m (i.e., 0, 20, 40, 60, 80). Figure 3 and 4 depict the average GLUE performance of D EPT, along with the associated training/inference time and memory cost compared to the vanilla PT. Below we discuss two key findings. # 1. D EPT improves time and memory efficiency substantially. Figure 3 presents the mean performance of D EPT, associated with average training time and memory, on the GLUE bench- marks, against different lengths of soft prompt m. The average training time and memory costs are computed across 8 tasks on the GLUE benchmark and three different model sizes. Both the encoder-decoder (T5) and decoder-only (GPT-2) models are evaluated across three different model sizes. The study reveals that decomposing the soft prompt ( l = 100) into a small soft prompt and low-rank matrices delivers comparable or even better performance while substantially enhancing the efficiency of training and reducing memory utilization. Specifically, using a soft prompt length greater than 20 in D EPT with the T5 model leads to a better average performance on the GLUE benchmark to vanilla PT, while improving the efficiency of training and reducing memory utiliza- tion by approximately 25%. This improvement is more pronounced (37% on the SST-2 dataset) when we test D EPT (with m = 60) using the T5-3B model (see ¬ßB for details). Similar observa- tions are also found when the GPT model is used, suggesting the adaptability of DEPT for different model architectures. It is worth noting that D EPT may have a notable performance drop regardless 6Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 50 60 70 80 90 100 Relative Train Time/Memory Cost (%) 50 60 70 80 90 100 Relative Train Time/Memory Cost (%) 0 20 40 60 80 100 Length of Soft Prompt, m 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90GLUE Performance (%) T5 Model 0 20 40 60 80 100 Length of Soft Prompt, m 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90GLUE Performance (%) GPT-2 Model T5-Small GPT2-Small T5-Base GPT2-Medium T5-Large GPT2-Large Memory Cost Train Time Figure 3: Performance on the GLUE benchmark for different soft prompt lengths m in D EPT, associated with corresponding relative train time and memory cost.

D EPT grows more efficient as the model size increases. Figure 4 represents the inference speed, measured by the average number of samples evaluated per second on the GLUE benchmark using a single RTX 3090 GPU. The inference time is computed using the Huggingface Trainer Class. We observe that the relative improvement in the number of inference samples per second over vanilla PT grows as the model size increases. For example, when using the T5- SMALL model, the vanilla PT evaluates 167.3 samples per second, while DEPT (m = 20) evaluates 178.3 samples per second, resulting in a 6.5% boost in inference speed. In contrast, when the T5- LARGE is utilized, the vanilla PT evaluates 21.0 samples per second and D EPT ( m = 20 ) evaluates 24.8 samples per second, resulting in an 18.1% increase in inference speed, a substantial rise from the previous 6.5%. This indicates that D EPT is particularly beneficial and more applicable in the context of LLMs. Please refer to Appendix ¬ßB for the inference speed of DEPT and PT using T5-3B and L LAMA -2. 3.4 F URTHER ANALYSIS Few-shot Learning. The vanilla PT often underperforms in the few-shot learning tasks (Gu et al., 2022) due to the first limitation discussed in ¬ß1. To evaluate the performance of D EPT in the few-shot setting, we employ the transfer learning method inspired by the recent PETL studies, as illustrated in Figure 2a. Specifically, we pre-train both the soft prompt and the low-rank pair on source tasks and select the best checkpoint before proceeding with the target task. Following prior works (Karimi Mahabadi et al., 2021; Asai et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023b), we evaluate the effectiveness of D EPT across 14 NLP tasks, with k training examples where k = 4, 16, 32. Our experimental findings reveal two key observations as follows: (1) DEPT integrates seamlessly with PETL approaches; and (2) D EPT attains competitive or even better performance than state-of-the- art PEFT approaches in the few-shot learning setting. Table 4 compares the effectiveness of our proposed method DEPT with various PEFT approaches in few-shot experiments, including full fine-tuning (FT), Adapters (AD), vanilla PT (PT), SPoT (ST), 7Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 Table 4: Few-shot learning results with k = {4, 16, 32 } on the SuperGLUE BooQ, SuperGLUE CB and SciTail datasets.

Table 5 presents the performance of D EPT against the vanilla PT and MPT on the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmark. Experimental results show that vanilla PT struggles with few-shot tasks, indicating the importance of PETL for the PT in few-shot learning tasks as suggested in previous works (Vu et al., 2022; Su et al., 2022). Nevertheless, the performance of D EPT largely benefits from the PETL framework (see Figure 2a). For example, while the vanilla PT obtains an accuracy of 53.5% on SuperGLUE CB dataset and 57.7% on the SciTail dataset when k=4, D EPT with PETL achieves an accuracy of 75.0% on SuperGLUE CB dataset and 78.1% on the SciTail dataset, for the same k value. This result supports our first observation about the compatibility of D EPT and PETL approaches. Furthermore, D EPT with transfer learning achieves comparable performance with the variant of the PT, MPT across 14 NLP tasks. Notably, DEPT surpasses the performance of all other variants of the PT (i.e., SPoT, ATTEMPT) and other PEFT approaches, demonstrating our method‚Äôs efficacy and endorsing our second observation. 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 GLUE Performance (%) Learning Rate LR=1e-3 LR=5e-4 Mixed LR Figure 5: Test results on GLUE bench- mark using T5- BASE , showing the im- portance of training D EPT with differ- ent learning rates. The importance of different learning rates. Figure 5 presents the experimental results from 3 different learn- ing rate settings to train the soft prompt and the pair of low-rank matrices as follows: (1) use a singular learning rate of 3e-1; (2) use a singular learning rate of 5e-4; (3) apply mixed learning rates (with grid search), where the soft prompt is trained with a larger rate and the pair of low-rank matrices is trained with a lower rate. In our ex- periments, the first option obtains an average performance of 40.8 on the GLUE benchmark. The second option exhibits an average performance of 54.7, while the third option demonstrates a largely improved average performance of 85.7 on the GLUE bench- mark. This indicates the importance of training D EPT with two different learning rates. 4 R ELATED WORKS Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning. In contrast to standard fine-tuning and prompt-based fine- tuning (Devlin et al., 2019; Schick & Sch¬®utze, 2021; Shi & Lipani, 2023) where full parameters are 8Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 updated, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches have demonstrated remarkable perfor- mance across a wide range of tasks (Wang et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2023a; Hendriksen et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2023b; Yang et al., 2023) while updating only a limited number of parame- ters. Adapters (Houlsby et al., 2019), along with its variants, HyperFormer (Karimi Mahabadi et al., 2021) and Compacter (Mahabadi et al., 2021), add new trainable modules (adapters) to each trans- former block of the T5 model (Raffel et al., 2020). BitFit (Ben Zaken et al., 2022) limits updates only to the bias parameters, while this method tends to underperform on larger networks (Lialin et al., 2023). Prefix-tuning (Li & Liang, 2021) adds a soft prompt, parameterized by a feed-forward network, to the model input. Diff pruning (Guo et al., 2021) learns a sparse update of a neural net- work‚Äôs weights at the cost of more memory usage. FishMask (Sung et al., 2021) also performs sparse updates, but it is computationally intensive and inefficient on contemporary deep learning hardware (Lialin et al., 2023). LoRA (Hu et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2024) employs a straightforward low-rank matrix decomposition to parameterise the weight update. (IA) 3 (Liu et al., 2022) scales activations by learned vectors for few-shot learning. LST (Sung et al., 2022b) operates a small transformer network on the side of the pre-trained network, aiming to decrease the training memory. Prompt Tuning (PT) (Lester et al., 2021) appends a trainable soft prompt to the model input embeddings. In comparison to the above-mentioned PEFT approaches, PT uses fewer trainable parameters, which do not proliferate as the model size expands. Mao et al. (2022) introduces a method that combines Prefix-tuning, Adapters, and LoRA through a gating mechanism. D EPT is also applicable to this method and can be easily integrated with other PEFT approaches. Transfer Learning for PT. Recent works aim to enhance the performance of PT through PETL. PPT (Gu et al., 2022) strives to improve the performance of PT (Lester et al., 2021) by further pre-training (Gururangan et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2023), which necessitates a set of hand-crafted, task-specific designs and considerable computational cost. Su et al. (2022) improves PT via prompt transfer across different tasks and models. SPoT (Vu et al., 2022) adopts a single prompt, chosen based on a similarity measure at the cost of a massive search. ATTEMPT (Asai et al., 2022) employs an attention mechanism over the source prompts to initialize the prompt for target tasks at the cost of extra parameters. MPT (Wang et al., 2023b) applies a shared soft prompt across different tasks, while its effectiveness for a broad range of source tasks remains untested. We find that PETL for PT (Asai et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023b) can efficiently accelerate training convergence, and that PETL for PT is more useful for improving the model performance in the few-shot learning setting for PT (Gu et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2022). However, when extensive labelled datasets are available, training PT or D EPT for additional steps typically leads to performance improvements. 5 E PILOGUE Conclusion. In this work, we propose Decomposed Prompt Tuning (D EPT), which substantially improves the efficiency of the vanilla PT in terms of time and memory while delivering competitive or even superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art PEFT methods. Remarkably, D EPT efficiency amplifies with increasing model sizes, making it exceptionally apt for LLMs. Our fur- ther analysis shows the compatibility of DEPT with PETL approaches and highlights its versatility across diverse model architectures and scales. Limitations and Future Work. We outline several limitations in our work: (1) the main limita- tion of D EPT is the introduction of extra hyperparameters for tuning, e.g., the learning rate of the low-rank matrices. This might introduce some additional computational overhead during the hy- perparameter optimization phase of model training. In our work, we train D EPT up to 300k steps (in a data-rich setting) following (Vu et al., 2022) with a careful search for optimal learning rates, which may increase training costs. However, the number of training steps might be efficiently re- duced by PETL, which we plan to investigate in future work. In addition, it is important to note that the model training process is a one-time event, while model inference is not. In this context, the efficiency benefits of DEPT become especially valuable; (2) the number of trainable parameters in DEPT depends on the maximum sequence length s. In this work, we have limited our evaluation to tasks with hundreds of input tokens. Future work could explore the performance of D EPT when s is extremely large; and (3) our research focuses on leveraging prompting techniques for LMs, where previous studies (Bender & Koller, 2020; Brown et al., 2020; Bender et al., 2021) have already addressed concerns and potential hazards linked to LMs. 9Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors express their gratitude to the ICLR reviewers and area chairs for their insightful discus- sions.

A M ODEL PERFORMANCE AGAINST THE PARAMETER -EFFICIENCY We visualize the experimental results in Table 1, as shown in Figure 6. The visualization shows that our proposed method D EPT outperforms other PEFT approaches and full fine-tuning baselines on the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmark (y-axis) while updating only a small number of trainable parameters (x-axis). 105 106 107 108 109 The number of trainable parameters 82 83 84 85 86Average Performance (%) GLUE Benchmark Full Fine-tuning Adapter AdapterDrop BitFit LoRA LST PT DePT (GPT-2 Large) DePT (T5-Base) Full Fine-tuning (m) Adapter (m) HyperFormer (m) HyperDecoder (m) SPoT ATTEMPT MPT 105 106 107 108 109 The number of trainable parameters 60.0 62.5 65.0 67.5 70.0 72.5 75.0 77.5Average Performance (%) SuperGLUE Benchmark Figure 6: The average performance against the number of trainable parameters on the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmark using the T5- BASE model. B A DDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS LLAMA -2. We evaluate the performance and inference speed of our proposed method DEPT using LLAMA -2-7B and L LAMA -2-13B (Touvron et al., 2023) on the SST-2 dataset. In our experiment, the soft prompt length for the vanilla PT is set to l = 100 . For D EPT, we set the soft prompt length to m = 60 and select a rank of r = 40 for the low-rank matrices. As shown in Table 6, our experimental results suggest that D EPT not only outperforms the vanilla PT in terms of test accuracy but also improves the speed of inference. We only limit our evaluation of D EPT to the 17Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 SST-2 dataset due to the high computational expenses. We will do our best to get the necessary resources to further probe the performance of DEPT, aiming to deliver a more exhaustive evaluation in future work.

We report the average performance on the Glue dataset as well as inference speed, measured in inference samples per second. As shown in Table 7, our findings indicate that DePT (m=60, r=30) outperforms PT in terms of inference speed by 37%. This suggests the advantage of DePT increases as the model size increases.

We have performed additional experiments regarding different prompt lengths, as shown in the Table below. Specifically, we have increased the size of trainable parameters in both DEPT and PT by a factor of two. We use the T5- BASE as the backbone. As shown in Table 8, we report the average performance on the Glue dataset as well as inference speed, measured in inference samples per second. Our findings indicate that D EPT (m=120, r=60) outperforms PT in terms of inference speed by 34%. We believe that this performance advantage can be further enhanced by reducing the value of m, which represents the length of the soft prompt. To provide a concrete example, on the SST-2 dataset, DEPT can achieve an inference speed of 77.2 samples per second, while PT can only infer 57.4 samples per second. This suggests the advantage of D EPT over PT increases as the model size increases.

Below, we provide a comprehensive list of the hyperparameters used in our code. In our work, we mainly cite the experimental results from the previous works Asai et al. (2022); Wang et al. (2023b); Sung et al. (2022b). In addition, we train LoRA with up to 200k steps. We search the learning rate within the set {5e-4, 1e-4, 5e-5, 1e-5}. We set the rank as 35. We choose a batch size of 32. We find that training LoRA on the MRQA dataset presents challenges, despite conducting a thorough search for optimal learning rates and training steps. The reasons for these difficulties remain uncertain. For prompt tuning and DEPT, as shown in Table 10, we conduct a grid search for learning rates. For the soft prompt, we search the learning rate within the set {3e-1, 4e-1, 5e-1}. For the low-rank matrice pairs, we search the learning rate within the set {1e-04, 5e-4, 1e-03, 5e-03 }. We choose a batch size of 16. We typically use the max sequence length as 256 except for the SuperGLUE-MultiRC, where the max sequence length is 348. In each trial, we train the model for 30,000 steps, evaluate performance every 1,000 steps, and select the best checkpoint based on optimal performance on the evaluation set. For the large dataset with more than 100,000 training examples, we follow the prior work (Vu et al., 2022) to train the vanilla PT and our proposed method D EPT with up to 300,000 steps. Training more steps helps improve the performance of the vanilla PT for the large dataset. The best performance is determined by the relevant evaluation metric. We train the T5 model from the original checkpoint rather than the LM-adapted 1.1 version (Lester et al., 2021). E F URTHER DISCUSSION Intuition. The intuition of DEPT is that (1) given the same number of trainable parameters, allow- ing some updates for word embeddings will improve the performance; and (2) a shorter soft prompt will improve the efficiency. To illustrate, the previous study (Wingate et al., 2022) has shown that a soft prompt can interpolate between many token embeddings, enabling the representation of more abstract concepts compared to relying on a single discrete token. However, the soft prompt in the PT is consistently added at the beginning of the frozen word embedding. In contrast, we propose DEPT, which decomposes the long soft prompt into a short soft prompt and a pair of low-rank matrices. This approach can (1) reduce the length of the soft prompt for better efficiency; and (2) permit rep- resentation updates within the frozen word embedding, thereby increasing the adaptability of input representations that were previously unavailable. Related works with similar titles. The meaning of ‚Äúcompose‚Äù and the method are fundamentally different between previous works (Khot et al., 2022; Nayak et al., 2022) and our work. Specifically, Decomposed Promptin (Khot et al., 2022) focuses on in-context learning, without the need to update parameters. Decomposed Prompting aligns closely with the work of chain-of-thoughts and self- consistency. In addition, CSP (Nayak et al., 2022) treats the attributes and objects that are composed to define classes as learnable tokens within the vocabulary. In contrast, our proposed method DePT does not train soft prompts associated with any vocabulary token, nor does it add additional tokens to the vocabulary. The main goal of DePT is to improve the efficiency of Prompt Tuning (PT) due to the increased input sequence issue. Comparison between Prompt Tuning (PT) and LoRA. We would like to discuss the comparison between Prompt Tuning (PT) and LoRA, as our work aims to improve the PT, in the following points: ‚Ä¢ Relative Performance of LoRA and PT. When adapting language models (LMs) to spe- cialised domains, like mathematical reasoning, which requires much different knowledge than what LLMs have been trained on, LoRA may perform better than Prompt Tuning (PT). However, in case tasks have already been somewhat understood by LMs and the key chal- lenge is just to properly prompt the LMs, PT can be the better option. PT modifies minimal 2https://huggingface.co/datasets/glue 3https://huggingface.co/datasets/super_glue 4https://huggingface.co/lucadiliello 5https://pytorch.org/ 6https://github.com/huggingface/transformers 7https://github.com/huggingface/peft 20Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 model parameters, focusing instead on improving the input prompt, which has been proven more effective than LoRA in prior studies (Asai et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023b). ‚Ä¢ Specific Use Cases for PT. PT offers advantages in particular cases. For example, soft prompts can be used to compress few-shot examples in the prompt or long context (Cheva- lier et al., 2023; Wingate et al., 2022). While the number of trainable parameters is low, LoRA updates the weight matrices across the whole model. In contrast, PT only improves the input of the LM through the soft prompt, which helps the model focus on understanding the task and context better rather than learning new knowledge. ‚Ä¢ Parameter Efficiency. Unlike LoRA, which requires trainable parameters at each layer, PT‚Äôs trainable parameters are more concentrated and less extensive. ‚Ä¢ Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PEFT) Framework. Framework. PETL frame- work (e.g., Asai et al. (2022); Wang et al. (2023b)) can effectively improve the performance of the PT and make it easier to use. In our work, we have demonstrated that our approach is compatible with the PEFT framework. 21",

Prompts are lightly tuned, allowing the model to be trained quickly since the main body of the ‚àóEqual contribution.

(2021) with tuning prompt parameters only achieves competitive perfor- mance against multi-task learning (MTL) baseline for the 11B parameter model with a big performance gap for smaller models.

(2021), the MTL baseline, and the full Ô¨Åne-tuning of Prompt- Tuning (our implementation) across model sizes with a large margin [e.g. 91.3 vs 90.2 (MTL) for T5 XXL]. pretrained model is kept frozen. To this end, this paradigm is strongly reminiscent of adapter layers (Houlsby et al., 2019a; Karimi Mahabadi et al., 2021; Zaken et al., 2021; He et al., 2021) which are also eÔ¨Éciently Ô¨Ånetuned. We introduce HyperPrompt, a natural but novel extension of Prompt-Tuning to multi-task learning (MTL) for language. HyperPrompt introduces task- conditioned hyper-prompts that conditions the model on task-speciÔ¨Åc information for constructing these prompts. Hyper-prompts are injected to the keys and values in the self-attention module, reminiscent of 1 arXiv:2203.00759v2  [cs.CL]  15 Jun 2022memory augmented Transformers (Sukhbaatar et al., 2019). This mitigates the cost of having prompts pass through the standard FFN layers in Transformers and serves as additional task-speciÔ¨Åc memory tokens for queries to attend to. We further improve upon this by introducing task- aware and layer-aware HyperNetworks (Ha et al., 2017) that parameterize and generate weights for the prompt generation process. The usage of HyperNet- work imbues our model with the necessary Ô¨Çexibil- ity and expressiveness, especially when it comes to incorporating task-speciÔ¨Åc and layer-speciÔ¨Åc infor- mation to the network. Meanwhile, HyperPrompt remains very parameter and computational eÔ¨Écient and friendly to multi-task scaling: the additional parameters scale sub-linearly with, and are inde- pendent of the number of tasks in practice. While Hypernetworks have enjoyed some success in learning adapters (Karimi Mahabadi et al., 2021; Tay et al., 2020) and/or continual learning (von Oswald et al., 2019), we note that this is the Ô¨Årst exploration of HyperNetworks as a prompt generator. Contrary to prior work, we additionally propose to Ô¨Ånetune the entire network instead of only the hyper- prompts. We make several compelling arguments for this. Firstly, Lester et al. (2021) shows that parame- ter eÔ¨Écient Prompt-Tuning only shines for large (e.g., 11B) models and substantially pales in comparison to Ô¨Åne-tuning when the model is moderately parameter- ized (e.g., 220M). Secondly, Ô¨Ånetuning only adaptive parameters (e.g., prompts/adapters) simply presents an illusion of eÔ¨Éciency (Dehghani et al., 2021). In reality, the FLOPs incurred by the model is still iden- tical on the forward pass, which saves no compute during inference. Parameter counts, especially when including only prompts and adapters, are not the only measurement of computational eÔ¨Éciency. Instead, the FLOPs and training time should be considered together to provide a holistic view. Our Contributions Overall, the main contribu- tions include: ‚Ä¢ We propose a novel HyperPrompt Transformer architecture with learnable hyper-prompts for multi-task Ô¨Åne-tuning with great parameter and computational eÔ¨Éciency. ‚Ä¢ We demonstrate that for diÔ¨Écult tasks, it is crucial to Ô¨Åne-tune the task-speciÔ¨Åc parameters together with the backbone model to achieve Pareto eÔ¨Éciency on all tasks. ‚Ä¢ We explore HyperNetworks as a prompt gen- erator, and inject hyper-prompts into the self- attention module as global task memory tokens. ‚Ä¢ HyperPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art parameter-eÔ¨Écient T5 models RaÔ¨Äel et al. (2019) using Prompt-Tuning or adapters on well-established benchmarks such as Super- GLUE and GLUE, across all explored model sizes (see Figure 1). 2 Problem Statement We consider the general setting of multi-task learning for a set of tasks {DœÑ}T œÑ=1, where T is the total num- ber of tasks and {DœÑ}= {x(n) œÑ ,y(n) œÑ }NœÑ n=1 indicates the corresponding training set of the œÑ-th task with NœÑ samples. We assume that a pre-trained Transformer model fŒ∏(¬∑) (e.g., T5) is given, where the model is pa- rameterized by Œ∏. To tackle such multi-task learning problem with fŒ∏(¬∑), we minimize the following objec- tive function L(Œ∏) = ‚àëT œÑ=1 ‚àëNœÑ n=1 C(fŒ∏(x(n) œÑ ),y(n) œÑ ), where C(¬∑,¬∑) is typically the cross-entropy loss and fŒ∏(x(n) œÑ ) is the output for training sample x(n) œÑ . Transformer-based pre-trained language models such as T5 RaÔ¨Äel et al. (2019) and BART Lewis et al. (2020) are uniÔ¨Åed text-to-text frameworks where all tasks share the same encoder-decoder architecture ‚Äì {{x(n) œÑ }NœÑ n=1}T œÑ=1 are fed into the same encoder and {{ÀÜy(n) œÑ }NœÑ n=1}T œÑ=1 are generated by the same decoder. For such universal modules, multi-task learning sim- ply corresponds to mixing task data sets together and there is no task-speciÔ¨Åc classiÔ¨Åcation or regression networks for each task as in encoder-only modules Devlin et al. (2019); Liu et al. (2019b). Previous work RaÔ¨Äel et al. (2019) shows that co- learning all tasks together on a pre-trained Trans- former model is inferior to Ô¨Åne-tuning on each task separately. A possible reason is that Œ∏ is task- agnostic (i.e., all parameters are shared) and hence task-speciÔ¨Åc information is not well captured which can be especially true for low-resource tasks. There- fore, a natural way to improve the performance of Transformers on multi-task learning is to intro- duce a set of task-conditioned parameters {Œ¥œÑ}T œÑ=1 into fŒ∏(.). The objective function can be updated as L(Œ∏,{Œ¥œÑ}T œÑ=1) = ‚àëT œÑ=1 ‚àëNœÑ n=1 C(fŒ∏,Œ¥œÑ(x(n) œÑ ),y(n) œÑ ), where Œ¥œÑ is the task-speciÔ¨Åc parameterization for the œÑ-th task. During training, both Œ∏ and {Œ¥œÑ}T œÑ=1 are updated via back-propagation because we observe a large performance drop in SuperGLUE when back- bone model Œ∏ is frozen and only task-conditioned parameters are tuned, as done in Karimi Mahabadi et al. (2021), which will be detailed in Section 4.3. To this end, our goal is to design task-conditioned 2parameterization of Transformer models to achieve greater parameter and computational eÔ¨Éciency as well as Pareto eÔ¨Éciency for multi-task learning . More explicitly, we have two goals: (1) improv- ing the Ô¨Ånetuning performance of most tasks in {DœÑ}T œÑ=1 by introducing task-conditioned parameters {Œ¥œÑ}T œÑ=1 into fŒ∏(.) and (2) under the constraint that‚àë œÑ ‚à•{Œ¥œÑ}T œÑ=1‚à•0 ‚â™‚à•Œ∏‚à•0, which means that the model capacity will not be signiÔ¨Åcantly increased. And the computational cost would not increase substantially either. 3 Methods In this section, we introduce HyperPrompt which has three variants: HyperPrompt-Share, HyperPrompt- Sep and HyperPrompt-Global (Figure 2). We fol- low two key design principles to formulate Hyper- Prompt: (1) injecting task-conditioning into self- attention module for better computational eÔ¨Éciency and more expressive power via token-level interac- tions, and (2) using HyperNetworks to simultaneously improve the parameter eÔ¨Éciency and allow a Ô¨Çexible degree of task sharing for better generalization. 3.1 Prompt-Based Task-Conditioned Transformer Previous adapter-based methods Karimi Mahabadi et al. (2021); Tay et al. (2020) for multi-task learning normally add an adapter (i.e., dense-relu-dense net- work) for each task after the feed-forward layers at every Transformer block. Instead, the key idea of our approach is to prepend l task-conditioned trainable vectors to the keys and values of the multihead self- attention layer at every Transformer block, where the task-speciÔ¨Åc attention feature maps are jointly learned with the task-agnostic representation. The idea of prepending learnable prompts to the network is explored before by Li & Liang (2021); Lester et al. (2021); Liu et al. (2021) for single-task Ô¨Åne-tuning. We Ô¨Årst introduce and expand this idea for multi-task learning in this subsection. SpeciÔ¨Å- cally, we design a novel method called HyperPrompt following the design principle #1 of injecting hyper- prompts into self-attention and #2 using HyperNet- works as generators for hyper-prompts. At a multihead self-attention layer, the original key, value and query are calculated as KœÑ = XœÑWk, VœÑ = XœÑWv, QœÑ = XœÑWq, where XœÑ ‚ààRL√ód is the input sequence of a training sample from the œÑ-th task, L is the sequence length, d is the model dimension. Wk ‚àà Rd√óh√ódh, Wv ‚àà Rd√óh√ódh and Wq ‚ààRd√óh√ódh project the input into original key KœÑ ‚àà RL√óh√ódh, value VœÑ ‚àà RL√óh√ódh and query QœÑ ‚ààRL√óh√ódh, h is the number of heads, dh is the dimension of each head and typically set to d/h to save parameters. To learn the task-speciÔ¨Åc information for the œÑ-th task, we have ltrainable d-dimensional vectors as the hyper-prompts for the key and the value respectively, denoted as PœÑ,k ‚ààRl√óh√ódh and PœÑ,v ‚ààRl√óh√ódh, as shown in Figure 2(a). Then, the hyper-prompts are concatenated with the original key and value: K‚Ä≤ œÑ = concat(PœÑ,k, KœÑ) (1) V ‚Ä≤ œÑ = concat(PœÑ,v, VœÑ) (2) where the new key (value) K‚Ä≤ œÑ (V ‚Ä≤ œÑ) ‚ààR(l+L)√óh√ódh are used to compute the multihead self-attention. After that, the multihead self-attention can be operated: OœÑ = Attention(QœÑ,K‚Ä≤ œÑ,V ‚Ä≤ œÑ) = softmax(QœÑK‚Ä≤T œÑ )V ‚Ä≤ œÑ where OœÑ ‚ààRL√ód is the out- put of multihead attention. The hyper-prompts beneÔ¨Åt Transformers for multi- task learning in two ways: (1) Prompt for key PœÑ,k is prepended with the original key and will partic- ipate in the calculation of attention feature map: softmax(QœÑK‚Ä≤T œÑ ). PœÑ,k directly interacts (matrix multiplication) with the original query QœÑ, allowing tokens to acquire task-speciÔ¨Åc semantics. (2) Prompt for value PœÑ,v is prepended with the original value and will be absorbed into the self-attention output OœÑ, where each position in OœÑ is the weighted-sum of vectors in V ‚Ä≤ œÑ with weights from the attention scores. This way, PœÑ,v can serve as task-speciÔ¨Åc memories for multihead attention to retrieve information from. 3.2 HyperPrompt How to obtain the prompts for the m-th Transformer block? A straightforward way is to directly initial- ize Pm œÑ,k and Pm œÑ,v. However, this way is parameter- ineÔ¨Écient, as it scales linearly with both the number of tasks T and the number layers M as O(T √óM). Instead, we initialize a global1 prompt PœÑ for each task and apply local HyperNetworks at every Trans- former block to project this prompt into {Pm œÑ,k}M m=1 and {Pm œÑ,v}M m=1. Global Prompts. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we initialize a set of global prompts {PœÑ}T œÑ=1, where PœÑ ‚ààRl√ód is a trainable matrix to learn the task-speciÔ¨Åc information 1we term itglobal because it is independent of the layer number as opposed to layer-dependent promptPm œÑ . 3Scaled Dot-Product Attention ConcatLinear QKVPV PK Multi-Head Attention UV RELU P DV PV PKLocal(ateachlayer)HyperNetworkhk,v Hyper Prompts Global Prompts (a) Global HyperNetworkHk,v UK,V DK,V ILayer-Aware Task Embedding HyperPrompt-Share/SepHyperPrompt-Global(b) (c) UK RELUDK Figure 2: HyperPrompt framework: (a) in each Transformer block, task-speciÔ¨Åc hyper-prompts PK,V are prepended to the original key K and value V for the query Qto attend to, (b) in HyperPrompt-Share/Sep, global prompts P are used to generate the hyper-prompts PK,V through local HyperNetworks hk,v at each Transformer layer, which consists of a down-projection matrix DK,V, a RELU layer and a up-project matrix UK,V, (c) in HyperPrompt-Global, all the local HyperNetworks ( DK,V, UK,V) are generated by global HyperNetworks Hk,v using layer-aware task embeddings I as task-speciÔ¨Åc inputs (see Section 3.3 for details). of the œÑ-th task, d is the model dimension and l is the length of the prompt. Local HyperNetworks. At the m-th Trans- former block, we apply two local HyperNetworks hm k and hm v to transform the global prompt PœÑ into layer-speciÔ¨Åc and task-speciÔ¨Åc prompts as shown in Figure 2(b): Pm œÑ,k = hm k (PœÑ) = Um k (Relu(Dm k (PœÑ))), (3) Pm œÑ,v = hm v (PœÑ) = Um v (Relu(Dm v (PœÑ))), (4) where Pm œÑ,k/v ‚ààRl√óh√ódh. We call these generated prompts hyper-prompts to distinguish from global prompts. In particular, to limit the number of parameters, the local HyperNetworks are designed using a bot- tleneck architecture: Dm k/v ‚àà Rd√ób and Um k/v ‚àà Rb√óh√ódh are down-projection and up-projection ma- trices, respectively. b is the bottleneck dimension satisfying b‚â™d. HyperPrompt-Share. We Ô¨Årst have all tasks share the same two local HyperNetworks deÔ¨Åned by the down-project matrices Dm k and Dm v , and the up-project matrices Um k and Um v . We refer to this design choice as HyperPrompt-Share. Despite the saving of parameters, one drawback of HyperPrompt-Share is that the task conÔ¨Çicts could arise given the limited model capacity Wu et al. (2020); Wang et al. (2020) of the shared local Hyper- Networks. HyperPrompt-Sep. In the opposite extreme of HyperPrompt-Share, each task can have its own local HyperNetworks hm œÑ,k(PœÑ) and hm œÑ,v(PœÑ) as following: Pm œÑ,k = hm œÑ,k(PœÑ) = Um œÑ,k(Relu(Dm œÑ,k(PœÑ))), (5) Pm œÑ,v = hm œÑ,v(PœÑ) = Um œÑ,v(Relu(Dm œÑ,v(PœÑ))), (6) where Dm œÑ,k/v and Um œÑ,k/v are down-projection and up-projection matrices for the œÑ task, respectively. In this case, each task hyper-prompt is trained inde- pendently and hence there is no information sharing. 3.3 HyperPrompt-Global We further propose a novel design of HyperPrompt- Global to Ô¨Çexibly share information and knowledge among tasks and blocks while maintaining a low parameter cost. As shown in Figure 2(c), the key idea of HyperPrompt-Global is to generate the local HyperNetworks using the same global HyperNetwork shared by all tasks and all Transformer blocks. Layer-Aware Task Embedding.Following the same recipe in Karimi Mahabadi et al. (2021), we deÔ¨Åne a layer-aware task embedding for better gen- eralization. Let kœÑ ‚ààRt‚Ä≤ denote the task embedding for the œÑ task and t‚Ä≤is the dimension. To capture the layer-speciÔ¨Åc information, layer embedding zm ‚ààRt‚Ä≤ is introduced. After that, a task projection network ht(¬∑,¬∑) is applied to fuse the task embedding and the 4layer embedding into the Ô¨Ånal layer-awared task em- bedding Im œÑ = ht(kœÑ,zm), where Im œÑ is the input to the shared global HyperNetworks as shown in Figure 1(c). ht is a MLP consisting of two feed-forward layers and a ReLU non-linearity, which takes the concatenation of kœÑ and zm as input. Global HyperNetworks. Hk(¬∑) generates the weight matrices (Um œÑ,k,Dm œÑ,k) in the local HyperNet- works of key hyper-prompts and another global Hy- perNetwork Hv(¬∑) generates the weight matrices (Um œÑ,v,Dm œÑ,v) in the local HyperNetworks of value hyper-prompts: (Um œÑ,k,Dm œÑ,k) = Hk(Im œÑ ) = (WUk,WDk)Im œÑ , (7) (Um œÑ,v,Dm œÑ,v) = Hv(Im œÑ ) = (WUv,WDv)Im œÑ , (8) where Im œÑ ‚ààRt is the layer-aware task embedding for the œÑ task at the m-th block. WDk ‚ààR(d√ób)√ót, WDv ‚ààR(d√ób)√ót, WUk ‚ààR(b√óh√ódh)√ót and WUv ‚àà R(b√óh√ódh)√ót are the weight matrices of Hk(¬∑) and Hv(¬∑). Given that Um œÑ,k/v, and Dm œÑ,k/v are generated by the global HyperNetworks, we project the global prompts PœÑ,k/v into hyper-promtps Pm œÑ,k/v following Eqs. 5 and 6. Finally, the hyper-prompts Pm œÑ,k/v are prepended with original key and value at every self- attention layer as shown in Figure 2(a) to calculate the task-conditioned attention scores. Using global HyperNetworks to generate the pro- jection networks has two beneÔ¨Åts: 1. It enables a more Ô¨Çexible way to share informa- tion across tasks and layers: the transformation matrices are decomposed into Hk/v(¬∑) that are shared by all tasks and all layers. Therefore, the model can adjust the degree of information sharing across tasks and layers through learn- ing the appropriate parameter values in Hk/v(¬∑) during the end-to-end training. 2. A parameter-eÔ¨Écient task conditioned param- eterization is enabled. The number of extra task-conditioned parameters doesn‚Äôt depend on the number of layers M, and scales sub- linearly with respect to the total number of tasks T. In practice, since task embeddings and task prompts have far fewer parameters than the global HyperNetworks, the additional task-conditioned parameters is almost indepen- dent of T. 3.4 Parameter EÔ¨Éciency of Hyper- Prompt As shown in A.1, the total number of additional pa- rameters from HyperPrompt-Global is dlT+ 4(bdt) + Tt‚Ä≤+Mt‚Ä≤+(2t‚Ä≤+t)e, where dis the model dimension, l is the length of the prompts, T is the total number of tasks, b is the bottleneck dimension of the weight matrices of the local HyperNetworks, d is the model dimension, t‚Ä≤/t is the dimension of the raw/Ô¨Ånal layer-aware task embedding, and e is the hidden di- mension of hk/v. Therefore, the space complexity is O(d(lT+4bt)), given that in practiceM ‚àºT, t‚Ä≤‚â™dl, and e‚â™bd. This leads to a sub-linear scaling with respect to T. Furthermore, T is typical ‚àºO(10) for multi-task learning. A reasonable l ‚àº O(10) is required to achieve the optimal performance, which will be de- tailed in Section 4.7. On the other hand, typical values for b‚àº24 and t‚â•32, and therefore 4 bt‚â´lT is satisÔ¨Åed in most cases. Hence, the space complexity could be further simpliÔ¨Åed as O(bdt). In conclusion, the space complexity of HyperPrompt-Global mainly comes from the global HyperNetworks and is practi- cally independent of the prompt length l, the number of Transformer layers M, and the number of tasks T. 4 Experiments 4.1 Experimental Setup Datasets. We evaluate the performance of the mod- els on GLUE Wang et al. (2018) and SuperGLUE Wang et al. (2019) respectively. Each of them is a collection of text classiÔ¨Åcation tasks to test the general language understanding ability. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the tasks include: sentence acceptability (CoLA), sentiment analysis (SST-2), paraphrasing/sentence similarity (MRPC, STS-B and QQP), natural lan- guage inference (MNLI, QNLI, RTE and CB), corefer- ence resolution (WSC), sentence completion (COPA), word sense disambiguation (WIC) and question an- swering (MultiRC and ReCoRD, BoolQ). Transformers. Following previous work Karimi Mahabadi et al. (2021) and Tay et al. (2020), our models are built on top of the state-of-the-art Transformer model T5 RaÔ¨Äel et al. (2019), which uses encoder-decoder architecture from Vaswani et al. (2017). We use already pre-trained T5 with sizes from Base (220M parameters) to XXL (11B). Evaluation. We save a checkpoint every 2000 steps for all models and follow the same convention 5as RaÔ¨Äel et al. (2019) in selecting the best checkpoint for each task. The emphasis of our evaluation is not to Ô¨Ånd the best single checkpoint for all tasks but to test the model‚Äôs ability of transfer learning among the co-trained tasks. We Ô¨Årst calculate the average of all metrics for each task and then report the average of all tasks for GLUE and SuperGLUE. Baselines. We compare our proposed MTL- Prompt and HyperPrompt-Share/Sep/Global with vanilla T5 models RaÔ¨Äel et al. (2019) for multi-task learning, which is referred to MTL. Another baseline is Vanilla Adapter proposed in Houlsby et al. (2019b) that add adapters modules for each task after each of the the two feed-forward modules in each Trans- former block of the T5 model. The state-of-the-art adapter-based method for multi-task learning is Hy- perFormer++ proposed in Karimi Mahabadi et al. (2021) that use HyperNetworks to generate adapters for each task and add them after the feed-forward modules following Houlsby et al. (2019b). In addition, Prompt-Tuning Lester et al. (2021) is originally for parameter-eÔ¨Écient single-task Ô¨Åne-tuning and only prepends prompts to the input word embeddings in the Ô¨Årst layer. We slightly modify it by initializing and prepending prompts for each task respectively so that Prompt-Tuning can be applied to multi-task learning. We defer additional details of the experiments to A.2 4.2 Key Results Figure 1 provides an overall summary of the results of HyperPrompt. Previous prompt-tuning Lester et al. (2021); Li & Liang (2021) methods focus on parameter-eÔ¨Écient single-task Ô¨Åne-tuning and hence freeze the backbone and only Ô¨Åne-tune the prompts. Their experiments show that the performance of only tuning the prompts can match the full model train- ing with a very large 11B model (Figure 1), but substantially pales for moderate model sizes. Our HyperPrompt-Global architecture when fully Ô¨Åne-tuned achieves state-of-the-art performance on SuperGLUE across four diÔ¨Äerent model sizes. Com- petitive adapter-tuning variants including Prompt- Tuning and HyperFormer++ can either match or slightly improve upon the multi-task learning (MTL) baseline on the SuperGLUE dataset. In contrast, HyperPrompt-Global outperforms the strong MTL baseline by a large margin on SuperGLUE score (78.9 vs 77.2 for T5 Base). Interestingly, such a perfor- mance gain continues all the way to model size as big as XXL (e.g. 91.3 vs 90.2) with only 0.14% additional Tunable Model GLUE SuperGLUE All MTL 88.3 85.9 All HyperFormer++ 88.8 86.4 All HyperPrompt-Global 89.4 87 Task HyperFormer++ 87.3 80.5 Task HyperPrompt-Global 87.5 81.5 Table 1: Comparison of Ô¨Åne-tuning all vs task-speciÔ¨Åc parameters using T5 Large. The average scores of GLUE and SuperGLUE are reported on T5 Large. parameters. 4.3 Tuning all vs Task-Conditioned Parameters Recently, Karimi Mahabadi et al. (2021) show that only tuning adapters can be competitive against the full Ô¨Åne-tuning. However, the evaluation is conducted only on the GLUE with smaller models including T5 Small and Base. In the experiments, we Ô¨Årst compare tuning the full model vs. only task-conditioned parameters. Table 1 shows the comparison on the GLUE and Super- GLUE average scores using T5 large (for per-task performance, please refer to A.4). For GLUE, the observation is consistent with Karimi Mahabadi et al. (2021), where task-speciÔ¨Åc only Ô¨Åne-tuning of Hyper- Former++ and HyperPrompt-Global is comparable to the MTL baseline. However, on SuperGLUE, we observe a large gap: the average score drops by 5.5 and 5.9 for HyperPrompt-Global and Hyper- Former++, respectively. Therefore, these experiments show that only tuning the task-conditioned parameters is not enough to achieve competitive results as full model training for multi-task learning on high-diÔ¨Éculty tasks such as SuperGLUE. This is consistent with the results of Prompt-Tuning Lester et al. (2021). Hence, the rest of the experiments are conducted with tuning all model parameters. 4.4 Computational EÔ¨Éciency Table 2 presents the computational eÔ¨Éciency of the Adapter/Prompt models. HyperPrompt-Global (together with HyperPrompt-Share) has the lowest # Ops since hyper-prompts are injected into self- attention and skip the standard FFN layers. In contrast, HyperFormer++ has ‚àº3x # Ops com- pared to other variants. Regarding training time, HyperPrompt-Share is fastest given that the local Hy- 6Model # Ops Training Time Vanilla Adapter 1.01 √ó1013 8.4h HyperFormer++ 3.14 √ó1013 10.3h Prompt-Tuning 1.16 √ó1013 11.1h HyperPrompt-Sep 1.01 √ó1013 8.9h HyperPrompt-Share 9.8 √ó1012 8.0h HyperPrompt-Global 9.8 √ó1012 8.7h Table 2: The number of operations for a single for- ward pass and training time on T5 Base. perNetworks are shared across tasks. Vanilla Adapter and HyperPrompt-Global are comparable while Hy- perFormer++ and Prompt-Tuning take signiÔ¨Åcant longer to do the full Ô¨Åne-tuning. This shows the computational eÔ¨Éciency of HyperPrompt for both training and inference. 4.5 Ablation Study Table 3 presents the results on T5 Base and Table 4 presents the results on T5 Large (see more detailed results in A.4). HyperPrompt-Global outperforms all baselines in terms of the average score of GLUE and SuperGLUE. HyperPrompt-Global vs. Prompt-Tuning. The original Prompt-Tuning Lester et al. (2021) is for single-task Ô¨Åne-tuning. To be parameter-eÔ¨Écient, it only trains the prompts with the backbone frozen. To make a fair comparison, we modify Prompt-Tuning by (1) training both prompts and backbone, and (2) adding prompt to each task and co-train all tasks together. As shown in Table 3 and 4, HyperPrompt- Global outperforms Prompt-Tuning by 2.0 (0.6) and 1.6 (1.4) on GLUE and SuperGLUE using T5 Base (Large), respectively. HyperPrompt-Global improves upon Prompt-Tuning in two places: (1) Prompt- Tuning only adds prompts to the word embedding layer while HyperPrompt-Global adds hyper-prompts at every Transformer layer and hence is more expres- sive; and (2) Prompts of tasks are trained indepen- dently in Prompt-Tuning while HyperPrompt-Global enables a Ô¨Çexible information sharing via HyperNet- works. HyperPrompt-Global vs. HyperFormer++. Our method is superior to the state-of-the-art base- line HyperFormer++ in the average score of GLUE and SuperGLUE for both Base and Large T5 model. For example, HyperPrompt-Global of T5 large achieves 87.0 on the SuperGLUE compared to 86.4 by HyperFormer++ (Table 4). Note that the main diÔ¨Äerence between the two methods is that Model #Params GLUE SuperGLUE MTL 1.0x 85.5 (0.9) 77.2 (0.2) Vanilla Adapter 1.06x 86.7 (0.3) 77.5 (0.1) HyperFormer++ 1.04x 86.5 (0.0) 78.2 (0.7) Prompt-Tuning 1.0003x 84.8 (0.6) 77.3 (0.2) HyperPrompt-Share1.008x 86.4 (0.6) 78.2 (0.7) HyperPrompt-Sep 1.06x 86.8 (0.1)77.5 (0.1) HyperPrompt-Global1.04x 86.8 (0.4) 78.9 (0.5) Table 3: GLUE and SuperGLUE average scores (stan- dard deviations) over 3 runs of HyperPrompt against baselines on T5 Base. HyperPrompt-Global inserts the task-conditioned pa- rameters as prompts into self-attention layers while HyperFormer++ insert adapters after each block. We believe task-conditioning in self-attention gives more expressive power than in the feed-forward net- work as done in adapters. Hyper-prompts that are prepended with the key and value participate in the attention interactions between diÔ¨Äerent token posi- tions, which helps the model to better capture the task-dependent semantics. HyperPrompt-Global vs. MTL.Next, we ob- serve that using HyperPrompt-Global can greatly improve the performance upon the vanilla Trans- former model (referred to MTL): 1.7 (1.1) gain on SuperGLUE score for T5 Base (Large) with 4% (2%) additional paramters. In conclusion, the experi- ments show that HyperPrompt-Global is a parameter- eÔ¨Écient and eÔ¨Äective task-conditioned parameteriza- tion of Transformers for multi-task learning. HyperPrompt-Global vs. HyperPrompt- Share/Sep. Interestingly, HyperPrompt-Share is better than HyperPrompt-Sep on the SuperGLUE on both Base and Large models while the opposite is true for GLUE. Notice that all tasks share the same two projection networks in HyperPrompt-Share while each task has its own projection networks in HyperPrompt-Sep. More importantly, we observe that HyperPrompt-Global, where the projection net- Model #Params GLUE SuperGLUE MTL 1.0x 88.3 (0.6) 85.9 (0.3) Vanilla Adapter 1.06x 88.8 (0.2) 86.1 (0.5) HyperFormer++ 1.02x 88.8 (0.0) 86.4 (0.5) Prompt-Tuning 1.0001x 88.8 (0.3) 85.6 (0.1) HyperPrompt-Share1.008x 89.3 (0.1) 86.8 (0.2) HyperPrompt-Sep 1.06x 89.4 (0.2)86.1 (0.3) HyperPrompt-Global1.02x 89.4 (0.1) 87.0 (0.5) Table 4: GLUE and SuperGLUE average scores (stan- dard deviations) over 3 runs of HyperPrompt against baselines on T5 Large. 7works are generated by the global HyperNetworks, always achieves the best performance on both GLUE and SuperGLUE. Hence, the experiments show that HyperPrompt-Global can adjust the degree of infor- mation sharing for better multi-task generalization, compared to HyperPrompt-Share/Sep. 4.6 Peeking into Hyper-Prompts To shed light on how hyper-prompts help improve the multi-task generalization via task-conditioning, we peek into HyperPrompt-Global models by looking at the distribution of attention scores. We choose the GLUE task MRPC as an example. To avoid biasing on individual examples, we aggregate over 100 vali- dation examples to compute the quantity of interest (see A.3 for details). First, we compute the atten- tion mass on hyper-prompts for each encoder layer. Figure 3 (top) shows that the network has lower at- tention mass on hyper-prompts in the lower layers and gradually increases attention mass for higher lay- ers. This phenomenon indicates that higher-levels of Transformer becomes more task-specialized while it is beneÔ¨Åcial for the lower-levels to learn task-agnostic representation Yosinski et al. (2014) by casting lower attention mass on hyper-prompts. Furthermore, we calculate the entropy of the attention scores on the tokens. For HyperPrompt-Global, we remove the hyper-prompts from the calculation and re-normalize the attention scores on the tokens to make a fair com- parison with the MTL baseline. Figure 3 (bottom) shows a shift of entropy distribution towards higher values for HyperPrompt-Global. This signiÔ¨Åes that injecting hyper-prompts encourages a more diverse attention distribution, which seems to be beneÔ¨Åcial to model generalization. 4.7 Impact of Hyper-Prompt Length HyperPrompt prepends l trainable hyper-prompts to the keys and values of self-attention layer at ev- ery Transformer layer. In Figure 4, we present the results of tuning the prompt length l on GLUE us- ing T5 Base as the example for HyperPrompt-Global (similar patterns are observed on T5 Large and Super- GLUE). We Ô¨Årst add hyper-prompts on the decoder and search the best l and then search the best l for the encoder with the Ô¨Åxed best decoder hyper- prompt length. As shown in Figure 4(a), l = 6 is the best for the decoder. As shown in Figure 4(b), HyperPrompt-Global achieves the best result of 86.8 when l= 16 on the encoder with l= 6 Ô¨Åxed for the decoder. The experiments show that hyper-prompts with length l‚àºO(10) are good enough to achieve su- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Layer 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2Attention Mass on Prompts 2 3 4 5 6 Entropy Over Tokens 0 500 1000 1500Count Model MTL HyperPrompt Figure 3: Visualization of attention mass and entropy distribution. perior performance. Note that the original sequence length is 512 on the encoder and 32 on the decoder. Therefore, HyperPrompt does not substantially in- crease the time complexity of self-attention layers in practice. 4.8 Encoder vs Decoder To understand the eÔ¨Äect of adding task-conditioned parameters to diÔ¨Äerent parts of the network, we present the results of HyperPrompt-Global and Hy- perFormer++ with adding hyper-prompts/adapters to: (1) encoder-only, (2) decoder-only, and (3) both encoder-decoder. As shown in Table 5, we ob- serve adding task-conditioned parameters to encoder (encoder-only) performs better than decoder-only 86.1 86.3 86.0 85.94 6 8 12 (a) Decoder 86.2 86.786.8 86.486.486.3 8 1216202428 (b) Encoder Figure 4: Impact of hyper-prompt length in HyperPrompt-Global (GLUE score on T5 Base). 8on GLUE. However, the opposite is true for Super- GLUE, where encoder-only is substantially worse than decoder-only. This potentially could be a train- ability issue when prompts are inserted into encoders, i.e. a diÔ¨Äerent learning rate might be required to learn the prompt parameters from scratch. We leave this investigation as a future work. Based on this experiment, we add task-conditioned parameters to the decoder for SuperGLUE in our experiments.

Prompt tuning is becoming a new paradigm for adapting pre-trained general- purpose language models to downstream tasks, as a lightweight alternative to the popular Ô¨Åne-tuning approach. Here, we use the term Prompt-Tuning to cover a general family of methods following the prompting idea in GPT-3 Brown et al. (2020). To avoid manually design the prompts, recent eÔ¨Äorts have focused on search for discrete prommpting words automatically Shin et al. (2020). On the other hand, soft prompts Li & Liang (2021); Hambardzumyan et al. (2021); Lester et al. (2021); Liu et al. (2021) in the form of continuous vectors are introduced to sim- plify the process and have shown competitive results in both natural language understanding Lester et al. (2021); Liu et al. (2021) and generation tasks Li & Liang (2021). In particular, Lester et al. (2021) show that soft prompts can become competitive against full Ô¨Åne-tuning for a 11B parameters model, but with a big performance gap when the model size is mod- erate. In our work, we close this gap in the full Ô¨Åne-tuning setting and demonstrated that Hyper- Prompt can outperform strong multi-task baselines across all model sizes studied. Adapter-Tuning. Adapter tuning Houlsby et al. (2019a,b); Karimi Mahabadi et al. (2021) is an alter- native approach for parameter-eÔ¨Écient lightweight tuning of pre-trained langauge models for down- stream tasks. Task-speciÔ¨Åc adapter layers Houlsby et al. (2019a) are inserted into the Transformer block for Ô¨Åne-tuning while the rest of the backbone model is frozen. By adding only a few percent of additional parameters, Karimi Mahabadi et al. (2021) show that competitive performance can be obtained on NLU benchmarks such as GLUE Wang et al. (2018). However, one limitation from the existing work is the evaluation of NLU on GLUE dataset, which is known to be no longer suitable for measuring the progress of language understanding Wang et al. (2019). In our work, we evaluate HyperPrompt on SuperGLUE in addition to GLUE dataset, and show that indeed higher-diÔ¨Éculty tasks such as SuperGLUE requires full-tuning of the model beyond adapter tuning, to be competitive against state-of-the-art multi-task base- lines. We also demonstrate that it is advantageous to inject prompts into self-attention than adding adapters. Multi-task Natural Language Understand- ing. Multi-task learning is an important and chal- lenge research direction in both full Ô¨Åne-tuning and prompt-tuning paradigms because of the competing needs of training and serving a single model while achieving Pareto eÔ¨Éciency in all tasks. The T5 model RaÔ¨Äel et al. (2019) renders all NLP tasks as a Text-to-Text problem. However, the best results are obtained by task-speciÔ¨Åc Ô¨Åne- tuning. MTDNN (multi-task deep neural network) Liu et al. (2019a) shares parameters between several NLP tasks, and achieves strong performance on the GLUE benchmark. Aghajanyan et al. (2021) use around 50 tasks to boost the multi-task learning per- formance. Aribandi et al. (2021) builds an extremely diverse set of 107 NLP tasks for extreme multi-task scaling and demonstrate superior performances on a wide range of benchmarks. Recently, Wei et al. (2021); Sanh et al. (2021) also illustrated how a multi- task learning stage can greatly improve the zero-shot prompting performance of large language models. 6 Conclusion We propose a novel architecture for prompt-based task-conditioning of self-attention in Transformers. The hyper-prompts are generated by a HyperNet- work to enable Ô¨Çexible information sharing among tasks while remain eÔ¨Écient in parameters and com- putation. HyperPrompt allows the network to learn task-speciÔ¨Åc feature maps where the hyper-prompts serve as task global memories, encouraging a more diverse distribution of attention. Extensive exper- iments show that HyperPrompt can achieve supe- 9rior performances over strong T5 multi-task learning baselines and parameter-eÔ¨Écient models including Prompt-Tuning and HyperFormer++ on GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks.

Bit- Ô¨Åt: Simple parameter-eÔ¨Écient Ô¨Åne-tuning for transformer-based masked language-models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.10199, 2021. 12A Appendix This section covers the parameter count of HyperPrompt, the experimental details, the calculation of attention mass and entropy, and per-task performance of GLUE and SuperGLUE. A.1 Parameter Count of HyperPrompt ( ¬ß3.4) Since the encoder and the decoder of Transformers have approximately the same capacity, the calculation considers only the decoder-side for simplicity. First, we have global task prompts PœÑ ‚ààRl√ód for the œÑ-th task, which contains dlT parameters for T tasks. The global HyperNetworks contain four weight matrices WDk ‚ààR(d√ób)√ót, WDv ‚ààR(d√ób)√ót, WUk ‚ààR(b√óh√ódh)√ót and WUv ‚ààR(b√óh√ódh)√ót, which result in 4( bdt) parameters (we let d= h√ódh). To obtain layer-aware task embedding, HyperPrompt learns task embedding kœÑ ‚ààRt‚Ä≤ for the œÑ task and layer embedding zm ‚ààRt‚Ä≤ for the m-th Transformer block, which in total results in Tt‚Ä≤+ Mt‚Ä≤parameters. Besides, a task projection network ht is applied to fuse the task embedding and the layer embedding into the Ô¨Ånal layer-aware task embedding Im œÑ ‚ààRt. ht is a two-layer feed-forward networks and contains (2t‚Ä≤+ t)e parameters, where e is the hidden dimension for ht. A.2 Experimental Details ( ¬ß4.1) Our models were implemented using Mesh TensorÔ¨Çow 2 Shazeer et al. (2018) with the T5 library 3 RaÔ¨Äel et al. (2019). Following RaÔ¨Äel et al. (2019), all data are preprocessed as into a ‚Äùsequence-to-sequence‚Äù format. The length of the sequence is 512 at the encoder and 32 at the decoder. For all experiments, we train models 300K steps with a batch size of 128 and each batch is a mixture which samples each task proportionately to the number of examples in the dataset. Learning rate is a constant of 1 e-3 with Adafactor optimizer (Shazeer & Stern, 2018). For hyper-parameters tuning, the length of prompt l is selected from {12,16,20,20,24}at the encoder and {2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16}at the decoder. The bottleneck dimension b in the transform matrices is set to d/r, where d is the model dimension of the T5 models and r is a reduction factor and selected from {16,32,64}. The dimension t of the layer-aware task embedding is selected from {32,64,128}. For a fair comparison, the hyper-parameters of baseline methods are set to have approximately the same numbers of parameters as HyperPrompt with the exception that Prompt-Tuning and MTL-Prompt-Share are extremely parameter-eÔ¨Écient with signiÔ¨Åcantly fewer parameters. A.3 Attention Mass and Entropy calculation ( ¬ß4.6) To calculate the attention mass over hyper-prompts per layer, we averaged the hyper-prompt attention softmax scores across 100 validation examples and each attention head in a layer, and summed across each query attending to the hyper-prompts. In other words, we aggregated the amount of attention given to hyper-prompts by queries. To calculate the attention entropy over tokens (other than hyper-prompts), we calculated the entropy of the attention distributions (averaged across attention heads) for 100 validation examples. This results in ‚àë100 n=1 ‚àë12 L=1 |Xn|entropies calculated and visualized in Figure 3 (bottom). For the HyperPrompt model, this involved re-normalizing the softmax distribution after removing hyper-prompts, as we wanted to understand how the original tokens are attended to. A.4 Per-Task Performance of GLUE and SuperGLUE Table 6 and 7 below show the comparison of Ô¨Åne-tuning the entire model against task-speciÔ¨Åc parameters only on GLUE and SuperGLUE datasets. Table 8 and 9 show the detailed results of full-tuning of HyperPrompt against baselines on T5 Base. Table 10 and 11 show the detailed results of full-tuning of HyperPrompt against baselines on T5 Large. 2https://github.com/tensorflow/mesh 3https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-Transformer 13Tunable Parameters Model CoLA SST-2 MRPC SST-B QQP MNLI QNLI RTE AVG All MTL 59.4 96.6 93.3/90.7 90.6/90.4 89.8/92.3 90.8/90.8 95.2 90.8 88.3 All HyperFormer++-T5.1.1large 63.3 96.6 93.2/90.7 92.1/91.9 89.7/92.3 90.5/90.7 95.1 89.9 88.8 All HyperPrompt-T5.1.1large 64.6 96.7 94.0/91.8 91.3/91.4 90.0/92.4 90.8/91.0 95.4 91.9 89.4 Task-SpeciÔ¨Åc HyperFormer++-T5.1.1large 58.9 95.7 92.7/90.0 91.6/91.5 87.7/90.7 89.8/90.0 94.5 87.0 87.3 Task-SpeciÔ¨Åc HyperPrompt-T5.1.1large 57.5 96.7 93.6/91.2 91.9/92.0 87.0/90.1 90.3/90.6 95.0 87.7 87.5 Table 6: Comparison of Ô¨Åne-tuning all vs task-speciÔ¨Åc parameters on GLUE.

Prompts are lightly tuned, allowing the model to be trained quickly since the main body of the ‚àóEqual contribution.

(2021) with tuning prompt parameters only achieves competitive perfor- mance against multi-task learning (MTL) baseline for the 11B parameter model with a big performance gap for smaller models. HyperPrompt-Global outper- forms the strong parameter-eÔ¨Écient adapter variant HyperFormer++ Karimi Mahabadi et al. (2021), the MTL baseline, and the full Ô¨Åne-tuning of Prompt- Tuning (our implementation) across model sizes with a large margin [e.g. 91.3 vs 90.2 (MTL) for T5 XXL]. pretrained model is kept frozen. To this end, this paradigm is strongly reminiscent of adapter layers (Houlsby et al., 2019a; Karimi Mahabadi et al., 2021; Zaken et al., 2021; He et al., 2021) which are also eÔ¨Éciently Ô¨Ånetuned. We introduce HyperPrompt, a natural but novel extension of Prompt-Tuning to multi-task learning (MTL) for language. HyperPrompt introduces task- conditioned hyper-prompts that conditions the model on task-speciÔ¨Åc information for constructing these prompts. Hyper-prompts are injected to the keys and values in the self-attention module, reminiscent of 1 arXiv:2203.00759v2  [cs.CL]  15 Jun 2022memory augmented Transformers (Sukhbaatar et al., 2019). This mitigates the cost of having prompts pass through the standard FFN layers in Transformers and serves as additional task-speciÔ¨Åc memory tokens for queries to attend to. We further improve upon this by introducing task- aware and layer-aware HyperNetworks (Ha et al., 2017) that parameterize and generate weights for the prompt generation process. The usage of HyperNet- work imbues our model with the necessary Ô¨Çexibil- ity and expressiveness, especially when it comes to incorporating task-speciÔ¨Åc and layer-speciÔ¨Åc infor- mation to the network. Meanwhile, HyperPrompt remains very parameter and computational eÔ¨Écient and friendly to multi-task scaling: the additional parameters scale sub-linearly with, and are inde- pendent of the number of tasks in practice. While Hypernetworks have enjoyed some success in learning adapters (Karimi Mahabadi et al., 2021; Tay et al., 2020) and/or continual learning (von Oswald et al., 2019), we note that this is the Ô¨Årst exploration of HyperNetworks as a prompt generator. Contrary to prior work, we additionally propose to Ô¨Ånetune the entire network instead of only the hyper- prompts. We make several compelling arguments for this. Firstly, Lester et al. (2021) shows that parame- ter eÔ¨Écient Prompt-Tuning only shines for large (e.g., 11B) models and substantially pales in comparison to Ô¨Åne-tuning when the model is moderately parameter- ized (e.g., 220M). Secondly, Ô¨Ånetuning only adaptive parameters (e.g., prompts/adapters) simply presents an illusion of eÔ¨Éciency (Dehghani et al., 2021). In reality, the FLOPs incurred by the model is still iden- tical on the forward pass, which saves no compute during inference. Parameter counts, especially when including only prompts and adapters, are not the only measurement of computational eÔ¨Éciency. Instead, the FLOPs and training time should be considered together to provide a holistic view. Our Contributions Overall, the main contribu- tions include: ‚Ä¢ We propose a novel HyperPrompt Transformer architecture with learnable hyper-prompts for multi-task Ô¨Åne-tuning with great parameter and computational eÔ¨Éciency. ‚Ä¢ We demonstrate that for diÔ¨Écult tasks, it is crucial to Ô¨Åne-tune the task-speciÔ¨Åc parameters together with the backbone model to achieve Pareto eÔ¨Éciency on all tasks. ‚Ä¢ We explore HyperNetworks as a prompt gen- erator, and inject hyper-prompts into the self- attention module as global task memory tokens. ‚Ä¢ HyperPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art parameter-eÔ¨Écient T5 models RaÔ¨Äel et al. (2019) using Prompt-Tuning or adapters on well-established benchmarks such as Super- GLUE and GLUE, across all explored model sizes (see Figure 1). 2 Problem Statement We consider the general setting of multi-task learning for a set of tasks {DœÑ}T œÑ=1, where T is the total num- ber of tasks and {DœÑ}= {x(n) œÑ ,y(n) œÑ }NœÑ n=1 indicates the corresponding training set of the œÑ-th task with NœÑ samples. We assume that a pre-trained Transformer model fŒ∏(¬∑) (e.g., T5) is given, where the model is pa- rameterized by Œ∏. To tackle such multi-task learning problem with fŒ∏(¬∑), we minimize the following objec- tive function L(Œ∏) = ‚àëT œÑ=1 ‚àëNœÑ n=1 C(fŒ∏(x(n) œÑ ),y(n) œÑ ), where C(¬∑,¬∑) is typically the cross-entropy loss and fŒ∏(x(n) œÑ ) is the output for training sample x(n) œÑ . Transformer-based pre-trained language models such as T5 RaÔ¨Äel et al. (2019) and BART Lewis et al. (2020) are uniÔ¨Åed text-to-text frameworks where all tasks share the same encoder-decoder architecture ‚Äì {{x(n) œÑ }NœÑ n=1}T œÑ=1 are fed into the same encoder and {{ÀÜy(n) œÑ }NœÑ n=1}T œÑ=1 are generated by the same decoder. For such universal modules, multi-task learning sim- ply corresponds to mixing task data sets together and there is no task-speciÔ¨Åc classiÔ¨Åcation or regression networks for each task as in encoder-only modules Devlin et al. (2019); Liu et al. (2019b). Previous work RaÔ¨Äel et al. (2019) shows that co- learning all tasks together on a pre-trained Trans- former model is inferior to Ô¨Åne-tuning on each task separately. A possible reason is that Œ∏ is task- agnostic (i.e., all parameters are shared) and hence task-speciÔ¨Åc information is not well captured which can be especially true for low-resource tasks. There- fore, a natural way to improve the performance of Transformers on multi-task learning is to intro- duce a set of task-conditioned parameters {Œ¥œÑ}T œÑ=1 into fŒ∏(.). The objective function can be updated as L(Œ∏,{Œ¥œÑ}T œÑ=1) = ‚àëT œÑ=1 ‚àëNœÑ n=1 C(fŒ∏,Œ¥œÑ(x(n) œÑ ),y(n) œÑ ), where Œ¥œÑ is the task-speciÔ¨Åc parameterization for the œÑ-th task. During training, both Œ∏ and {Œ¥œÑ}T œÑ=1 are updated via back-propagation because we observe a large performance drop in SuperGLUE when back- bone model Œ∏ is frozen and only task-conditioned parameters are tuned, as done in Karimi Mahabadi et al. (2021), which will be detailed in Section 4.3. To this end, our goal is to design task-conditioned 2parameterization of Transformer models to achieve greater parameter and computational eÔ¨Éciency as well as Pareto eÔ¨Éciency for multi-task learning . More explicitly, we have two goals: (1) improv- ing the Ô¨Ånetuning performance of most tasks in {DœÑ}T œÑ=1 by introducing task-conditioned parameters {Œ¥œÑ}T œÑ=1 into fŒ∏(.) and (2) under the constraint that‚àë œÑ ‚à•{Œ¥œÑ}T œÑ=1‚à•0 ‚â™‚à•Œ∏‚à•0, which means that the model capacity will not be signiÔ¨Åcantly increased. And the computational cost would not increase substantially either. 3 Methods In this section, we introduce HyperPrompt which has three variants: HyperPrompt-Share, HyperPrompt- Sep and HyperPrompt-Global (Figure 2). We fol- low two key design principles to formulate Hyper- Prompt: (1) injecting task-conditioning into self- attention module for better computational eÔ¨Éciency and more expressive power via token-level interac- tions, and (2) using HyperNetworks to simultaneously improve the parameter eÔ¨Éciency and allow a Ô¨Çexible degree of task sharing for better generalization. 3.1 Prompt-Based Task-Conditioned Transformer Previous adapter-based methods Karimi Mahabadi et al. (2021); Tay et al. (2020) for multi-task learning normally add an adapter (i.e., dense-relu-dense net- work) for each task after the feed-forward layers at every Transformer block. Instead, the key idea of our approach is to prepend l task-conditioned trainable vectors to the keys and values of the multihead self- attention layer at every Transformer block, where the task-speciÔ¨Åc attention feature maps are jointly learned with the task-agnostic representation. The idea of prepending learnable prompts to the network is explored before by Li & Liang (2021); Lester et al. (2021); Liu et al. (2021) for single-task Ô¨Åne-tuning. We Ô¨Årst introduce and expand this idea for multi-task learning in this subsection. SpeciÔ¨Å- cally, we design a novel method called HyperPrompt following the design principle #1 of injecting hyper- prompts into self-attention and #2 using HyperNet- works as generators for hyper-prompts. At a multihead self-attention layer, the original key, value and query are calculated as KœÑ = XœÑWk, VœÑ = XœÑWv, QœÑ = XœÑWq, where XœÑ ‚ààRL√ód is the input sequence of a training sample from the œÑ-th task, L is the sequence length, d is the model dimension. Wk ‚àà Rd√óh√ódh, Wv ‚àà Rd√óh√ódh and Wq ‚ààRd√óh√ódh project the input into original key KœÑ ‚àà RL√óh√ódh, value VœÑ ‚àà RL√óh√ódh and query QœÑ ‚ààRL√óh√ódh, h is the number of heads, dh is the dimension of each head and typically set to d/h to save parameters. To learn the task-speciÔ¨Åc information for the œÑ-th task, we have ltrainable d-dimensional vectors as the hyper-prompts for the key and the value respectively, denoted as PœÑ,k ‚ààRl√óh√ódh and PœÑ,v ‚ààRl√óh√ódh, as shown in Figure 2(a). Then, the hyper-prompts are concatenated with the original key and value: K‚Ä≤ œÑ = concat(PœÑ,k, KœÑ) (1) V ‚Ä≤ œÑ = concat(PœÑ,v, VœÑ) (2) where the new key (value) K‚Ä≤ œÑ (V ‚Ä≤ œÑ) ‚ààR(l+L)√óh√ódh are used to compute the multihead self-attention. After that, the multihead self-attention can be operated: OœÑ = Attention(QœÑ,K‚Ä≤ œÑ,V ‚Ä≤ œÑ) = softmax(QœÑK‚Ä≤T œÑ )V ‚Ä≤ œÑ where OœÑ ‚ààRL√ód is the out- put of multihead attention. The hyper-prompts beneÔ¨Åt Transformers for multi- task learning in two ways: (1) Prompt for key PœÑ,k is prepended with the original key and will partic- ipate in the calculation of attention feature map: softmax(QœÑK‚Ä≤T œÑ ). PœÑ,k directly interacts (matrix multiplication) with the original query QœÑ, allowing tokens to acquire task-speciÔ¨Åc semantics. (2) Prompt for value PœÑ,v is prepended with the original value and will be absorbed into the self-attention output OœÑ, where each position in OœÑ is the weighted-sum of vectors in V ‚Ä≤ œÑ with weights from the attention scores. This way, PœÑ,v can serve as task-speciÔ¨Åc memories for multihead attention to retrieve information from. 3.2 HyperPrompt How to obtain the prompts for the m-th Transformer block? A straightforward way is to directly initial- ize Pm œÑ,k and Pm œÑ,v. However, this way is parameter- ineÔ¨Écient, as it scales linearly with both the number of tasks T and the number layers M as O(T √óM). Instead, we initialize a global1 prompt PœÑ for each task and apply local HyperNetworks at every Trans- former block to project this prompt into {Pm œÑ,k}M m=1 and {Pm œÑ,v}M m=1. Global Prompts. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we initialize a set of global prompts {PœÑ}T œÑ=1, where PœÑ ‚ààRl√ód is a trainable matrix to learn the task-speciÔ¨Åc information 1we term itglobal because it is independent of the layer number as opposed to layer-dependent promptPm œÑ . 3Scaled Dot-Product Attention ConcatLinear QKVPV PK Multi-Head Attention UV RELU P DV PV PKLocal(ateachlayer)HyperNetworkhk,v Hyper Prompts Global Prompts (a) Global HyperNetworkHk,v UK,V DK,V ILayer-Aware Task Embedding HyperPrompt-Share/SepHyperPrompt-Global(b) (c) UK RELUDK Figure 2: HyperPrompt framework: (a) in each Transformer block, task-speciÔ¨Åc hyper-prompts PK,V are prepended to the original key K and value V for the query Qto attend to, (b) in HyperPrompt-Share/Sep, global prompts P are used to generate the hyper-prompts PK,V through local HyperNetworks hk,v at each Transformer layer, which consists of a down-projection matrix DK,V, a RELU layer and a up-project matrix UK,V, (c) in HyperPrompt-Global, all the local HyperNetworks ( DK,V, UK,V) are generated by global HyperNetworks Hk,v using layer-aware task embeddings I as task-speciÔ¨Åc inputs (see Section 3.3 for details). of the œÑ-th task, d is the model dimension and l is the length of the prompt. Local HyperNetworks. At the m-th Trans- former block, we apply two local HyperNetworks hm k and hm v to transform the global prompt PœÑ into layer-speciÔ¨Åc and task-speciÔ¨Åc prompts as shown in Figure 2(b): Pm œÑ,k = hm k (PœÑ) = Um k (Relu(Dm k (PœÑ))), (3) Pm œÑ,v = hm v (PœÑ) = Um v (Relu(Dm v (PœÑ))), (4) where Pm œÑ,k/v ‚ààRl√óh√ódh. We call these generated prompts hyper-prompts to distinguish from global prompts. In particular, to limit the number of parameters, the local HyperNetworks are designed using a bot- tleneck architecture: Dm k/v ‚àà Rd√ób and Um k/v ‚àà Rb√óh√ódh are down-projection and up-projection ma- trices, respectively. b is the bottleneck dimension satisfying b‚â™d. HyperPrompt-Share. We Ô¨Årst have all tasks share the same two local HyperNetworks deÔ¨Åned by the down-project matrices Dm k and Dm v , and the up-project matrices Um k and Um v . We refer to this design choice as HyperPrompt-Share. Despite the saving of parameters, one drawback of HyperPrompt-Share is that the task conÔ¨Çicts could arise given the limited model capacity Wu et al. (2020); Wang et al. (2020) of the shared local Hyper- Networks. HyperPrompt-Sep. In the opposite extreme of HyperPrompt-Share, each task can have its own local HyperNetworks hm œÑ,k(PœÑ) and hm œÑ,v(PœÑ) as following: Pm œÑ,k = hm œÑ,k(PœÑ) = Um œÑ,k(Relu(Dm œÑ,k(PœÑ))), (5) Pm œÑ,v = hm œÑ,v(PœÑ) = Um œÑ,v(Relu(Dm œÑ,v(PœÑ))), (6) where Dm œÑ,k/v and Um œÑ,k/v are down-projection and up-projection matrices for the œÑ task, respectively. In this case, each task hyper-prompt is trained inde- pendently and hence there is no information sharing. 3.3 HyperPrompt-Global We further propose a novel design of HyperPrompt- Global to Ô¨Çexibly share information and knowledge among tasks and blocks while maintaining a low parameter cost. As shown in Figure 2(c), the key idea of HyperPrompt-Global is to generate the local HyperNetworks using the same global HyperNetwork shared by all tasks and all Transformer blocks. Layer-Aware Task Embedding.Following the same recipe in Karimi Mahabadi et al. (2021), we deÔ¨Åne a layer-aware task embedding for better gen- eralization. Let kœÑ ‚ààRt‚Ä≤ denote the task embedding for the œÑ task and t‚Ä≤is the dimension. To capture the layer-speciÔ¨Åc information, layer embedding zm ‚ààRt‚Ä≤ is introduced. After that, a task projection network ht(¬∑,¬∑) is applied to fuse the task embedding and the 4layer embedding into the Ô¨Ånal layer-awared task em- bedding Im œÑ = ht(kœÑ,zm), where Im œÑ is the input to the shared global HyperNetworks as shown in Figure 1(c). ht is a MLP consisting of two feed-forward layers and a ReLU non-linearity, which takes the concatenation of kœÑ and zm as input. Global HyperNetworks. Hk(¬∑) generates the weight matrices (Um œÑ,k,Dm œÑ,k) in the local HyperNet- works of key hyper-prompts and another global Hy- perNetwork Hv(¬∑) generates the weight matrices (Um œÑ,v,Dm œÑ,v) in the local HyperNetworks of value hyper-prompts: (Um œÑ,k,Dm œÑ,k) = Hk(Im œÑ ) = (WUk,WDk)Im œÑ , (7) (Um œÑ,v,Dm œÑ,v) = Hv(Im œÑ ) = (WUv,WDv)Im œÑ , (8) where Im œÑ ‚ààRt is the layer-aware task embedding for the œÑ task at the m-th block. WDk ‚ààR(d√ób)√ót, WDv ‚ààR(d√ób)√ót, WUk ‚ààR(b√óh√ódh)√ót and WUv ‚àà R(b√óh√ódh)√ót are the weight matrices of Hk(¬∑) and Hv(¬∑). Given that Um œÑ,k/v, and Dm œÑ,k/v are generated by the global HyperNetworks, we project the global prompts PœÑ,k/v into hyper-promtps Pm œÑ,k/v following Eqs. 5 and 6. Finally, the hyper-prompts Pm œÑ,k/v are prepended with original key and value at every self- attention layer as shown in Figure 2(a) to calculate the task-conditioned attention scores. Using global HyperNetworks to generate the pro- jection networks has two beneÔ¨Åts: 1. It enables a more Ô¨Çexible way to share informa- tion across tasks and layers: the transformation matrices are decomposed into Hk/v(¬∑) that are shared by all tasks and all layers. Therefore, the model can adjust the degree of information sharing across tasks and layers through learn- ing the appropriate parameter values in Hk/v(¬∑) during the end-to-end training. 2. A parameter-eÔ¨Écient task conditioned param- eterization is enabled. The number of extra task-conditioned parameters doesn‚Äôt depend on the number of layers M, and scales sub- linearly with respect to the total number of tasks T. In practice, since task embeddings and task prompts have far fewer parameters than the global HyperNetworks, the additional task-conditioned parameters is almost indepen- dent of T. 3.4 Parameter EÔ¨Éciency of Hyper- Prompt As shown in A.1, the total number of additional pa- rameters from HyperPrompt-Global is dlT+ 4(bdt) + Tt‚Ä≤+Mt‚Ä≤+(2t‚Ä≤+t)e, where dis the model dimension, l is the length of the prompts, T is the total number of tasks, b is the bottleneck dimension of the weight matrices of the local HyperNetworks, d is the model dimension, t‚Ä≤/t is the dimension of the raw/Ô¨Ånal layer-aware task embedding, and e is the hidden di- mension of hk/v. Therefore, the space complexity is O(d(lT+4bt)), given that in practiceM ‚àºT, t‚Ä≤‚â™dl, and e‚â™bd. This leads to a sub-linear scaling with respect to T. Furthermore, T is typical ‚àºO(10) for multi-task learning. A reasonable l ‚àº O(10) is required to achieve the optimal performance, which will be de- tailed in Section 4.7. On the other hand, typical values for b‚àº24 and t‚â•32, and therefore 4 bt‚â´lT is satisÔ¨Åed in most cases. Hence, the space complexity could be further simpliÔ¨Åed as O(bdt). In conclusion, the space complexity of HyperPrompt-Global mainly comes from the global HyperNetworks and is practi- cally independent of the prompt length l, the number of Transformer layers M, and the number of tasks T. 4 Experiments 4.1 Experimental Setup Datasets. We evaluate the performance of the mod- els on GLUE Wang et al. (2018) and SuperGLUE Wang et al. (2019) respectively. Each of them is a collection of text classiÔ¨Åcation tasks to test the general language understanding ability. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the tasks include: sentence acceptability (CoLA), sentiment analysis (SST-2), paraphrasing/sentence similarity (MRPC, STS-B and QQP), natural lan- guage inference (MNLI, QNLI, RTE and CB), corefer- ence resolution (WSC), sentence completion (COPA), word sense disambiguation (WIC) and question an- swering (MultiRC and ReCoRD, BoolQ). Transformers. Following previous work Karimi Mahabadi et al. (2021) and Tay et al. (2020), our models are built on top of the state-of-the-art Transformer model T5 RaÔ¨Äel et al. (2019), which uses encoder-decoder architecture from Vaswani et al. (2017). We use already pre-trained T5 with sizes from Base (220M parameters) to XXL (11B). Evaluation. We save a checkpoint every 2000 steps for all models and follow the same convention 5as RaÔ¨Äel et al. (2019) in selecting the best checkpoint for each task. The emphasis of our evaluation is not to Ô¨Ånd the best single checkpoint for all tasks but to test the model‚Äôs ability of transfer learning among the co-trained tasks. We Ô¨Årst calculate the average of all metrics for each task and then report the average of all tasks for GLUE and SuperGLUE. Baselines. We compare our proposed MTL- Prompt and HyperPrompt-Share/Sep/Global with vanilla T5 models RaÔ¨Äel et al. (2019) for multi-task learning, which is referred to MTL. Another baseline is Vanilla Adapter proposed in Houlsby et al. (2019b) that add adapters modules for each task after each of the the two feed-forward modules in each Trans- former block of the T5 model. The state-of-the-art adapter-based method for multi-task learning is Hy- perFormer++ proposed in Karimi Mahabadi et al. (2021) that use HyperNetworks to generate adapters for each task and add them after the feed-forward modules following Houlsby et al. (2019b). In addition, Prompt-Tuning Lester et al. (2021) is originally for parameter-eÔ¨Écient single-task Ô¨Åne-tuning and only prepends prompts to the input word embeddings in the Ô¨Årst layer. We slightly modify it by initializing and prepending prompts for each task respectively so that Prompt-Tuning can be applied to multi-task learning. We defer additional details of the experiments to A.2 4.2 Key Results Figure 1 provides an overall summary of the results of HyperPrompt. Previous prompt-tuning Lester et al. (2021); Li & Liang (2021) methods focus on parameter-eÔ¨Écient single-task Ô¨Åne-tuning and hence freeze the backbone and only Ô¨Åne-tune the prompts. Their experiments show that the performance of only tuning the prompts can match the full model train- ing with a very large 11B model (Figure 1), but substantially pales for moderate model sizes. Our HyperPrompt-Global architecture when fully Ô¨Åne-tuned achieves state-of-the-art performance on SuperGLUE across four diÔ¨Äerent model sizes. Com- petitive adapter-tuning variants including Prompt- Tuning and HyperFormer++ can either match or slightly improve upon the multi-task learning (MTL) baseline on the SuperGLUE dataset. In contrast, HyperPrompt-Global outperforms the strong MTL baseline by a large margin on SuperGLUE score (78.9 vs 77.2 for T5 Base). Interestingly, such a perfor- mance gain continues all the way to model size as big as XXL (e.g. 91.3 vs 90.2) with only 0.14% additional Tunable Model GLUE SuperGLUE All MTL 88.3 85.9 All HyperFormer++ 88.8 86.4 All HyperPrompt-Global 89.4 87 Task HyperFormer++ 87.3 80.5 Task HyperPrompt-Global 87.5 81.5 Table 1: Comparison of Ô¨Åne-tuning all vs task-speciÔ¨Åc parameters using T5 Large. The average scores of GLUE and SuperGLUE are reported on T5 Large. parameters. 4.3 Tuning all vs Task-Conditioned Parameters Recently, Karimi Mahabadi et al. (2021) show that only tuning adapters can be competitive against the full Ô¨Åne-tuning. However, the evaluation is conducted only on the GLUE with smaller models including T5 Small and Base. In the experiments, we Ô¨Årst compare tuning the full model vs. only task-conditioned parameters. Table 1 shows the comparison on the GLUE and Super- GLUE average scores using T5 large (for per-task performance, please refer to A.4). For GLUE, the observation is consistent with Karimi Mahabadi et al. (2021), where task-speciÔ¨Åc only Ô¨Åne-tuning of Hyper- Former++ and HyperPrompt-Global is comparable to the MTL baseline. However, on SuperGLUE, we observe a large gap: the average score drops by 5.5 and 5.9 for HyperPrompt-Global and Hyper- Former++, respectively. Therefore, these experiments show that only tuning the task-conditioned parameters is not enough to achieve competitive results as full model training for multi-task learning on high-diÔ¨Éculty tasks such as SuperGLUE. This is consistent with the results of Prompt-Tuning Lester et al. (2021). Hence, the rest of the experiments are conducted with tuning all model parameters. 4.4 Computational EÔ¨Éciency Table 2 presents the computational eÔ¨Éciency of the Adapter/Prompt models. HyperPrompt-Global (together with HyperPrompt-Share) has the lowest # Ops since hyper-prompts are injected into self- attention and skip the standard FFN layers. In contrast, HyperFormer++ has ‚àº3x # Ops com- pared to other variants. Regarding training time, HyperPrompt-Share is fastest given that the local Hy- 6Model # Ops Training Time Vanilla Adapter 1.01 √ó1013 8.4h HyperFormer++ 3.14 √ó1013 10.3h Prompt-Tuning 1.16 √ó1013 11.1h HyperPrompt-Sep 1.01 √ó1013 8.9h HyperPrompt-Share 9.8 √ó1012 8.0h HyperPrompt-Global 9.8 √ó1012 8.7h Table 2: The number of operations for a single for- ward pass and training time on T5 Base. perNetworks are shared across tasks. Vanilla Adapter and HyperPrompt-Global are comparable while Hy- perFormer++ and Prompt-Tuning take signiÔ¨Åcant longer to do the full Ô¨Åne-tuning. This shows the computational eÔ¨Éciency of HyperPrompt for both training and inference. 4.5 Ablation Study Table 3 presents the results on T5 Base and Table 4 presents the results on T5 Large (see more detailed results in A.4). HyperPrompt-Global outperforms all baselines in terms of the average score of GLUE and SuperGLUE. HyperPrompt-Global vs. Prompt-Tuning. The original Prompt-Tuning Lester et al. (2021) is for single-task Ô¨Åne-tuning. To be parameter-eÔ¨Écient, it only trains the prompts with the backbone frozen. To make a fair comparison, we modify Prompt-Tuning by (1) training both prompts and backbone, and (2) adding prompt to each task and co-train all tasks together. As shown in Table 3 and 4, HyperPrompt- Global outperforms Prompt-Tuning by 2.0 (0.6) and 1.6 (1.4) on GLUE and SuperGLUE using T5 Base (Large), respectively. HyperPrompt-Global improves upon Prompt-Tuning in two places: (1) Prompt- Tuning only adds prompts to the word embedding layer while HyperPrompt-Global adds hyper-prompts at every Transformer layer and hence is more expres- sive; and (2) Prompts of tasks are trained indepen- dently in Prompt-Tuning while HyperPrompt-Global enables a Ô¨Çexible information sharing via HyperNet- works. HyperPrompt-Global vs. HyperFormer++. Our method is superior to the state-of-the-art base- line HyperFormer++ in the average score of GLUE and SuperGLUE for both Base and Large T5 model. For example, HyperPrompt-Global of T5 large achieves 87.0 on the SuperGLUE compared to 86.4 by HyperFormer++ (Table 4). Note that the main diÔ¨Äerence between the two methods is that Model #Params GLUE SuperGLUE MTL 1.0x 85.5 (0.9) 77.2 (0.2) Vanilla Adapter 1.06x 86.7 (0.3) 77.5 (0.1) HyperFormer++ 1.04x 86.5 (0.0) 78.2 (0.7) Prompt-Tuning 1.0003x 84.8 (0.6) 77.3 (0.2) HyperPrompt-Share1.008x 86.4 (0.6) 78.2 (0.7) HyperPrompt-Sep 1.06x 86.8 (0.1)77.5 (0.1) HyperPrompt-Global1.04x 86.8 (0.4) 78.9 (0.5) Table 3: GLUE and SuperGLUE average scores (stan- dard deviations) over 3 runs of HyperPrompt against baselines on T5 Base. HyperPrompt-Global inserts the task-conditioned pa- rameters as prompts into self-attention layers while HyperFormer++ insert adapters after each block. We believe task-conditioning in self-attention gives more expressive power than in the feed-forward net- work as done in adapters. Hyper-prompts that are prepended with the key and value participate in the attention interactions between diÔ¨Äerent token posi- tions, which helps the model to better capture the task-dependent semantics. HyperPrompt-Global vs. MTL.Next, we ob- serve that using HyperPrompt-Global can greatly improve the performance upon the vanilla Trans- former model (referred to MTL): 1.7 (1.1) gain on SuperGLUE score for T5 Base (Large) with 4% (2%) additional paramters. In conclusion, the experi- ments show that HyperPrompt-Global is a parameter- eÔ¨Écient and eÔ¨Äective task-conditioned parameteriza- tion of Transformers for multi-task learning. HyperPrompt-Global vs. HyperPrompt- Share/Sep. Interestingly, HyperPrompt-Share is better than HyperPrompt-Sep on the SuperGLUE on both Base and Large models while the opposite is true for GLUE. Notice that all tasks share the same two projection networks in HyperPrompt-Share while each task has its own projection networks in HyperPrompt-Sep. More importantly, we observe that HyperPrompt-Global, where the projection net- Model #Params GLUE SuperGLUE MTL 1.0x 88.3 (0.6) 85.9 (0.3) Vanilla Adapter 1.06x 88.8 (0.2) 86.1 (0.5) HyperFormer++ 1.02x 88.8 (0.0) 86.4 (0.5) Prompt-Tuning 1.0001x 88.8 (0.3) 85.6 (0.1) HyperPrompt-Share1.008x 89.3 (0.1) 86.8 (0.2) HyperPrompt-Sep 1.06x 89.4 (0.2)86.1 (0.3) HyperPrompt-Global1.02x 89.4 (0.1) 87.0 (0.5) Table 4: GLUE and SuperGLUE average scores (stan- dard deviations) over 3 runs of HyperPrompt against baselines on T5 Large. 7works are generated by the global HyperNetworks, always achieves the best performance on both GLUE and SuperGLUE. Hence, the experiments show that HyperPrompt-Global can adjust the degree of infor- mation sharing for better multi-task generalization, compared to HyperPrompt-Share/Sep. 4.6 Peeking into Hyper-Prompts To shed light on how hyper-prompts help improve the multi-task generalization via task-conditioning, we peek into HyperPrompt-Global models by looking at the distribution of attention scores. We choose the GLUE task MRPC as an example. To avoid biasing on individual examples, we aggregate over 100 vali- dation examples to compute the quantity of interest (see A.3 for details). First, we compute the atten- tion mass on hyper-prompts for each encoder layer. Figure 3 (top) shows that the network has lower at- tention mass on hyper-prompts in the lower layers and gradually increases attention mass for higher lay- ers. This phenomenon indicates that higher-levels of Transformer becomes more task-specialized while it is beneÔ¨Åcial for the lower-levels to learn task-agnostic representation Yosinski et al. (2014) by casting lower attention mass on hyper-prompts. Furthermore, we calculate the entropy of the attention scores on the tokens. For HyperPrompt-Global, we remove the hyper-prompts from the calculation and re-normalize the attention scores on the tokens to make a fair com- parison with the MTL baseline. Figure 3 (bottom) shows a shift of entropy distribution towards higher values for HyperPrompt-Global. This signiÔ¨Åes that injecting hyper-prompts encourages a more diverse attention distribution, which seems to be beneÔ¨Åcial to model generalization. 4.7 Impact of Hyper-Prompt Length HyperPrompt prepends l trainable hyper-prompts to the keys and values of self-attention layer at ev- ery Transformer layer. In Figure 4, we present the results of tuning the prompt length l on GLUE us- ing T5 Base as the example for HyperPrompt-Global (similar patterns are observed on T5 Large and Super- GLUE). We Ô¨Årst add hyper-prompts on the decoder and search the best l and then search the best l for the encoder with the Ô¨Åxed best decoder hyper- prompt length. As shown in Figure 4(a), l = 6 is the best for the decoder. As shown in Figure 4(b), HyperPrompt-Global achieves the best result of 86.8 when l= 16 on the encoder with l= 6 Ô¨Åxed for the decoder. The experiments show that hyper-prompts with length l‚àºO(10) are good enough to achieve su- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Layer 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2Attention Mass on Prompts 2 3 4 5 6 Entropy Over Tokens 0 500 1000 1500Count Model MTL HyperPrompt Figure 3: Visualization of attention mass and entropy distribution. perior performance. Note that the original sequence length is 512 on the encoder and 32 on the decoder. Therefore, HyperPrompt does not substantially in- crease the time complexity of self-attention layers in practice. 4.8 Encoder vs Decoder To understand the eÔ¨Äect of adding task-conditioned parameters to diÔ¨Äerent parts of the network, we present the results of HyperPrompt-Global and Hy- perFormer++ with adding hyper-prompts/adapters to: (1) encoder-only, (2) decoder-only, and (3) both encoder-decoder. As shown in Table 5, we ob- serve adding task-conditioned parameters to encoder (encoder-only) performs better than decoder-only 86.1 86.3 86.0 85.94 6 8 12 (a) Decoder 86.2 86.786.8 86.486.486.3 8 1216202428 (b) Encoder Figure 4: Impact of hyper-prompt length in HyperPrompt-Global (GLUE score on T5 Base). 8on GLUE. However, the opposite is true for Super- GLUE, where encoder-only is substantially worse than decoder-only. This potentially could be a train- ability issue when prompts are inserted into encoders, i.e. a diÔ¨Äerent learning rate might be required to learn the prompt parameters from scratch. We leave this investigation as a future work. Based on this experiment, we add task-conditioned parameters to the decoder for SuperGLUE in our experiments.

Prompt tuning is becoming a new paradigm for adapting pre-trained general- purpose language models to downstream tasks, as a lightweight alternative to the popular Ô¨Åne-tuning approach. Here, we use the term Prompt-Tuning to cover a general family of methods following the prompting idea in GPT-3 Brown et al. (2020). To avoid manually design the prompts, recent eÔ¨Äorts have focused on search for discrete prommpting words automatically Shin et al. (2020). On the other hand, soft prompts Li & Liang (2021); Hambardzumyan et al. (2021); Lester et al. (2021); Liu et al. (2021) in the form of continuous vectors are introduced to sim- plify the process and have shown competitive results in both natural language understanding Lester et al. (2021); Liu et al. (2021) and generation tasks Li & Liang (2021). In particular, Lester et al. (2021) show that soft prompts can become competitive against full Ô¨Åne-tuning for a 11B parameters model, but with a big performance gap when the model size is mod- erate. In our work, we close this gap in the full Ô¨Åne-tuning setting and demonstrated that Hyper- Prompt can outperform strong multi-task baselines across all model sizes studied. Adapter-Tuning. Adapter tuning Houlsby et al. (2019a,b); Karimi Mahabadi et al. (2021) is an alter- native approach for parameter-eÔ¨Écient lightweight tuning of pre-trained langauge models for down- stream tasks. Task-speciÔ¨Åc adapter layers Houlsby et al. (2019a) are inserted into the Transformer block for Ô¨Åne-tuning while the rest of the backbone model is frozen. By adding only a few percent of additional parameters, Karimi Mahabadi et al. (2021) show that competitive performance can be obtained on NLU benchmarks such as GLUE Wang et al. (2018). However, one limitation from the existing work is the evaluation of NLU on GLUE dataset, which is known to be no longer suitable for measuring the progress of language understanding Wang et al. (2019). In our work, we evaluate HyperPrompt on SuperGLUE in addition to GLUE dataset, and show that indeed higher-diÔ¨Éculty tasks such as SuperGLUE requires full-tuning of the model beyond adapter tuning, to be competitive against state-of-the-art multi-task base- lines. We also demonstrate that it is advantageous to inject prompts into self-attention than adding adapters. Multi-task Natural Language Understand- ing. Multi-task learning is an important and chal- lenge research direction in both full Ô¨Åne-tuning and prompt-tuning paradigms because of the competing needs of training and serving a single model while achieving Pareto eÔ¨Éciency in all tasks. The T5 model RaÔ¨Äel et al. (2019) renders all NLP tasks as a Text-to-Text problem. However, the best results are obtained by task-speciÔ¨Åc Ô¨Åne- tuning. MTDNN (multi-task deep neural network) Liu et al. (2019a) shares parameters between several NLP tasks, and achieves strong performance on the GLUE benchmark. Aghajanyan et al. (2021) use around 50 tasks to boost the multi-task learning per- formance. Aribandi et al. (2021) builds an extremely diverse set of 107 NLP tasks for extreme multi-task scaling and demonstrate superior performances on a wide range of benchmarks. Recently, Wei et al. (2021); Sanh et al. (2021) also illustrated how a multi- task learning stage can greatly improve the zero-shot prompting performance of large language models. 6 Conclusion We propose a novel architecture for prompt-based task-conditioning of self-attention in Transformers. The hyper-prompts are generated by a HyperNet- work to enable Ô¨Çexible information sharing among tasks while remain eÔ¨Écient in parameters and com- putation. HyperPrompt allows the network to learn task-speciÔ¨Åc feature maps where the hyper-prompts serve as task global memories, encouraging a more diverse distribution of attention. Extensive exper- iments show that HyperPrompt can achieve supe- 9rior performances over strong T5 multi-task learning baselines and parameter-eÔ¨Écient models including Prompt-Tuning and HyperFormer++ on GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks.

Bit- Ô¨Åt: Simple parameter-eÔ¨Écient Ô¨Åne-tuning for transformer-based masked language-models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.10199, 2021. 12A Appendix This section covers the parameter count of HyperPrompt, the experimental details, the calculation of attention mass and entropy, and per-task performance of GLUE and SuperGLUE. A.1 Parameter Count of HyperPrompt ( ¬ß3.4) Since the encoder and the decoder of Transformers have approximately the same capacity, the calculation considers only the decoder-side for simplicity. First, we have global task prompts PœÑ ‚ààRl√ód for the œÑ-th task, which contains dlT parameters for T tasks. The global HyperNetworks contain four weight matrices WDk ‚ààR(d√ób)√ót, WDv ‚ààR(d√ób)√ót, WUk ‚ààR(b√óh√ódh)√ót and WUv ‚ààR(b√óh√ódh)√ót, which result in 4( bdt) parameters (we let d= h√ódh). To obtain layer-aware task embedding, HyperPrompt learns task embedding kœÑ ‚ààRt‚Ä≤ for the œÑ task and layer embedding zm ‚ààRt‚Ä≤ for the m-th Transformer block, which in total results in Tt‚Ä≤+ Mt‚Ä≤parameters. Besides, a task projection network ht is applied to fuse the task embedding and the layer embedding into the Ô¨Ånal layer-aware task embedding Im œÑ ‚ààRt. ht is a two-layer feed-forward networks and contains (2t‚Ä≤+ t)e parameters, where e is the hidden dimension for ht. A.2 Experimental Details ( ¬ß4.1) Our models were implemented using Mesh TensorÔ¨Çow 2 Shazeer et al. (2018) with the T5 library 3 RaÔ¨Äel et al. (2019). Following RaÔ¨Äel et al. (2019), all data are preprocessed as into a ‚Äùsequence-to-sequence‚Äù format. The length of the sequence is 512 at the encoder and 32 at the decoder. For all experiments, we train models 300K steps with a batch size of 128 and each batch is a mixture which samples each task proportionately to the number of examples in the dataset. Learning rate is a constant of 1 e-3 with Adafactor optimizer (Shazeer & Stern, 2018). For hyper-parameters tuning, the length of prompt l is selected from {12,16,20,20,24}at the encoder and {2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16}at the decoder. The bottleneck dimension b in the transform matrices is set to d/r, where d is the model dimension of the T5 models and r is a reduction factor and selected from {16,32,64}. The dimension t of the layer-aware task embedding is selected from {32,64,128}. For a fair comparison, the hyper-parameters of baseline methods are set to have approximately the same numbers of parameters as HyperPrompt with the exception that Prompt-Tuning and MTL-Prompt-Share are extremely parameter-eÔ¨Écient with signiÔ¨Åcantly fewer parameters. A.3 Attention Mass and Entropy calculation ( ¬ß4.6) To calculate the attention mass over hyper-prompts per layer, we averaged the hyper-prompt attention softmax scores across 100 validation examples and each attention head in a layer, and summed across each query attending to the hyper-prompts. In other words, we aggregated the amount of attention given to hyper-prompts by queries. To calculate the attention entropy over tokens (other than hyper-prompts), we calculated the entropy of the attention distributions (averaged across attention heads) for 100 validation examples. This results in ‚àë100 n=1 ‚àë12 L=1 |Xn|entropies calculated and visualized in Figure 3 (bottom). For the HyperPrompt model, this involved re-normalizing the softmax distribution after removing hyper-prompts, as we wanted to understand how the original tokens are attended to. A.4 Per-Task Performance of GLUE and SuperGLUE Table 6 and 7 below show the comparison of Ô¨Åne-tuning the entire model against task-speciÔ¨Åc parameters only on GLUE and SuperGLUE datasets.

It has been recognized that prompt design plays an essential role in the generation quality. We need to adjust the prompt to make the model better understand our intentions and produce higher-quality results [Reynolds and McDonell, 2021, Zhou et al., 2022b]. The problem is severe in text-to-image models because the capacity of their text encoders, such as CLIP text encoder [Radford et al., 2021] in Stable Diffu- sion [Rombach et al., 2022], is relatively small. Empirical observations also confirm that common user input is often insufficient to produce aesthetically pleasing images with current models. Prior efforts implement manual prompt engineering towards specific text-to-image models [Liu and Chilton, 2021, Oppenlaender, 2022, Parsons, 2022], typically adding some modifiers to the original input. However, it is laborious and sometimes infeasible to conduct manual prompt engineering. Besides, the manually engineered prompts often cannot be transferred between various model versions. Therefore, it is necessary to find a systematic way to automatically align user intentions and various model-preferred prompts. In this work, we propose a prompt adaptation framework for automatic prompt engineering via reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first perform supervised fine-tuning with a pretrained language model (e.g., GPT) on a small collection of manually engineered prompts. The finetuned model is used to initialize the prompt policy network for reinforcement learning. Next, the model is trained by exploring optimized prompts of user inputs, where diverse beam search [Vijayakumar et al., 2016] is used to ensure generation quality and diversity. The training objective is to maximize the reward, which is defined as a combination of relevance scores and aesthetic scores of generated ‚àó Equal contribution. arXiv:2212.09611v2  [cs.CL]  29 Dec 2023AestheticScoreHumanInput Text-to-Image RelevanceScoreReward HumanInput Optimized Prompt Text-to-Image OptimizedPrompt Stage 1: Supervised Fine-Tuning Stage 2: Reinforcement LearningTrain with PPO LM as Promptist LM as Promptist Figure 1: Overview of PROMPTIST training: (1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on manually engineered prompts; (2) reinforcement learning (RL) to increase the rewards of generated images after prompt optimization. images. The relevance score reflects how much the original user intentions are retained after prompt adaptation. The aesthetic score indicates what degree the generated images are aesthetically pleasing. We conduct experiments with the publicly available Stable Diffusion models [Rombach et al., 2022]. We evaluate our method using both the automatic reward metric and human preference ratings. Experimental results show that the optimized prompts outperform human-engineered ones and the original inputs. Human preference ratings also show consistent improvements across in-domain and out-of-domain prompts. Moreover, we find that reinforcement learning is more favorable than supervised fine-tuning, especially on out-of-domain user inputs. Overall, we show that language models can serve as a prompt interface that optimizes user input into model-preferred prompts. Our contributions are as follows: ‚Ä¢ We propose a general prompt optimization framework that adapts user input to model- preferred prompts. ‚Ä¢ We collect user queries and conduct extensive experiments on text-to-image generation. ‚Ä¢ Experimental results show that our method outperforms manual prompt engineering in terms of both automatic metrics and human preference ratings. 2 Methods The goal of our prompt adaptation framework is to automatically perform prompt engineering. Given user input of the text-to-image generator, our model learns to generate model-preferred prompts that obtain better output images while preserving their original intentions. Figure 1 presents the overview of our method. The prompt optimization model is named PROMPTIST , which is built upon a pretrained language model, such as GPT [Brown et al., 2020]. We first collect a set of human-engineered examples and use them to conduct supervised fine-tuning (Section 2.1). Next, we perform reinforcement learning (Section 2.3) to maximize the target reward (Section 2.2), which improves both relevance and quality of generated images. 2.1 Supervised fine-tuning Initialized with a pretrained generative language model, the policy model is first finetuned on a set of prompt pairs before reinforcement learning. A parallel prompt corpus D = {(x, y)} contains prompt 2pairs of original user inputs x and manually engineered examples y. The training objective is to maximize the log-likelihood with teacher forcing: LSFT = ‚àíE(x,y)‚àºD log p(y|x) (1) where the finetuned weights are used to initialize the policy network in reinforcement learning. Collect human demonstrations We collect human-engineered prompts from Lexica 2. Most prompts are composed of two parts, i.e., main content that describes the user‚Äôs intention, and some modifiers that customize the art style, such as artist names, and popular elements. We use the crawled human-engineered prompts as targets. In order to obtain parallel data, we use three methods to construct their source inputs. First, we extract the main contents by trimming the modifiers and regard them as original user inputs. Second, we randomly remove or shuffle some modifiers and use the remaining texts as source inputs. Third, we use the OpenAI API text-davinci-002 to rephrase the main contents and the human-engineered prompts, respectively. We find that the template ‚Äú[Input] Rephrase:‚Äù works well in practice and translates input to a more user-friendly version. As shown in Table 1, given a target prompt ‚Äúdieselpunk blue wolf with fuzzy tail, concept art, dramatic, fantasy, pixiv‚Äù, there are four source prompts collected. Table 1: An example of a human-engineered prompt and four types of our constructed source prompts. Human-engineered target prompt dieselpunk blue wolf with fuzzy tail, concept art, dramatic, fantasy, pixiv Main content dieselpunk blue wolf with fuzzy tail Main content with random modifiersdieselpunk blue wolf with fuzzy tail, dramatic Rephrasing of main content A blue wolf with a fuzzy tail that looks like it belongs in a dieselpunk setting. Rephrasing of target prompt This is a dieselpunk-style blue wolf with a fuzzy tail. It looks like it could be from a fantasy or dramatic piece of artwork. 2.2 Reward definition We measure the quality of optimized prompts from two aspects, namely relevance and aesthetics. The goal motivates us to define the reward function R(¬∑) from the above two perspectives. First, we measure whether the generated images are relevant to the original input prompt after prompt adaptation. To be specific, we first sample images by the text-to-image model conditioned on the optimized prompt, respectively. Then, we compute CLIP [Radford et al., 2021] similarity scores to measure how relevant the generated images and the original input prompts are. The resulting relevance score is defined as: frel(x,y) =Eiy‚àºG(y)[frel(x, iy)] (2) frel(x, iy) =min(20 ‚àó gCLIP(x, iy) ‚àí 5.6, 0) (3) where iy ‚àº G(y) means sampling images iy from the text-to-image model G with y as input prompt, and gCLIP(¬∑, ¬∑) stands for the CLIP similarity function. Notice that we always compute the similarity between the generated images and the original input prompt, which ensures the relevance score reflects the user preferences. We determine the specific form of the relevance score according to the approximate range of the clip score. Experiments show that this form works well in reinforcement learning. If the relevance score is relatively reasonable (larger than 0.28), we encourage the model to generate more aesthetically pleasing images. Second, we employ the aesthetic predictor3 to quantify aesthetic preferences. The predictor builds a linear estimator on top of a frozen CLIP model, which is trained by human ratings in the Aesthetic Visual Analysis [Murray et al., 2012] dataset. The aesthetic score is defined as: faes(x, y) =Eix‚àºG(x),iy‚àºG(y)[gaes(iy)‚àígaes(ix)] (4) 2https://lexica.art 3https://github.com/christophschuhmann/improved-aesthetic-predictor 3where gaes(¬∑) denotes the aesthetic predictor, and iy, ix are the images generated by the prompts y and x, respectively. Notice that both gCLIP(¬∑) and gaes(¬∑) require the CLIP model, so we can share the CLIP forward pass during reward computation. Finally, we define the overall reward by combining the above scores with an additional KL penalty, which is between the policy model œÄŒ∏ and the supervised finetuned model œÄSFT with coefficient Œ∑: R(x, y) =faes(x, y) +frel(x, y) ‚àí Œ∑ log œÄŒ∏(y|x) œÄSFT(y|x) (5) The KL term is added to mitigate the overoptimization issue [Ouyang et al., 2022]. 2.3 Reinforcement learning Starting from the supervised fine-tuning, we further finetune our model with reinforcement learning. We employ proximal policy optimization (PPO) [Schulman et al., 2017], which is empirically data- efficient and of reliable performance. As a text generation problem, prompt optimization can be viewed as a Markov decision process (MDP) ‚ü®S, A, r, fst, Œ≥‚ü© with a finite state space S, action space A, reward function r, state-transition probability function fst, and a discount term Œ≥. In an episode of prompt adaptation, the initial state x ‚àà Sis the input prompt with n tokens x = (x1, . . . , xn) where each token x is from a finite vocabulary V. At t-th time step, the agent selects an action yt ‚àà Vaccording to the current policy model yt ‚àº œÄ(y|x, y<t). With a deterministic state transition, the next state is (x, y<t+1) = (x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yt). The episode ends when the agent selects an end-of-sentence action. The goal of the agent is to maximize the accumulated expected reward Ex,y P t Œ≥tr(x, y<t) =Ex,yR(x, y). Let œÄŒ∏ denote the policy model to be trained, we maximize the accumulated expected reward over a training set D‚Ä≤ = {x}: J = Ex‚àºD‚Ä≤,y‚àºœÄŒ∏ [R(x, y)] (6) We implement both the policy model œÄŒ∏ and the value function model as generative language models, with the language modeling head and the regression head, respectively. The parameters of the two models are initialized from the supervised finetuned policy model œÄSFT and are optimized during reinforcement learning. The supervised finetuned model œÄSFT and the score function model are frozen during training. Besides, we employ the clipped probability ratios [Schulman et al., 2017] to avoid large policy updates. 3 Experiments We conduct experiments on public text-to-image model Stable Diffusion v1.44 and v1.55 . We use the DPM solver [Lu et al., 2022] to accelerate image sampling and set the denoising steps to 20. 3.1 Data collection For supervised fine-tuning, we collect 90k target prompts from Lexica website and construct four types of source prompts as described in Section 2.1, obtaining 360k paired data in total. At the reinforcement learning stage, we only require source prompts and the policy can explore better rephrasings itself. We use three types of data: (1) in-domain prompts from DiffusionDB [Wang et al., 2022], which is a gallery of prompts specified by real users. We use the user input (main content) for exploration and the manually engineered prompt (with modifiers) for comparison, (2) out-of-domain image captions from COCO dataset [Chen et al., 2015], (3) image labels from ImageNet-21k [Deng et al., 2009], the sizes of which are 600k, 600k and 40k respectively. We empirically observe that human-engineered prompts from Lexica perform better than those from DiffusionDB so we use the former in supervised fine-tuning. To improve the data diversity, we add image caption data and image label data in reinforcement learning. To avoid model bias in certain data formats, we randomize the capitalization of the first letter of each prompt and randomly add periods at the end of it. 4https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4 5https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5 4MC MCM                                   In-Domain (Lexica) RMC RTP In-Domain (DiffusionDB) Out-of-Domain (COCO) 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 0.2 Reward User Input Supervised Fine-Tuning Promptist (Ours) Human Engineered Prompt Figure 2: Reward comparison of optimized prompts with other baselines on in-domain and out-of- domain data.

Results indicate that the text-to-image model benefits a lot from our method. Table 2: Absolute reward improvements of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. It is observed that RL generally outperforms the SFT-only model.

Supervised fine-tuning We finetune GPT-2 to predict the target prompt conditioned on the source prompt with teacher forcing. The input format is [Source] Rephrase:[Target]. We use a batch size of 256, a learning rate of 5e-5, and a max length of 512. We finetune the model for 15k steps and choose a slightly underfitting checkpoint according to the validation loss which aims to avoid overfitting and provide a proper exploration space for the policy. Reinforcement learning We train the policy with Proximal Policy Optimization [Schulman et al., 2017, PPO]. The value and policy network are initialized from the supervised finetuned model. The parameters of the value function are separated from the policy to avoid excessive competition between two objectives. To guarantee the quality and diversity of exploration, we adopt diverse beam search [Vijayakumar et al., 2016] with a beam size of 8 and a diversity penalty of 1.0. We find that having too long rephrasings occasionally produces aesthetically pleasing but misleading results, especially for short user input like image labels. In order to prevent the model from only exploring long completions, the maximum generation length at each step is set to a random value from 15 to 75 so that the policy can learn to adjust the generation length for each prompt. We randomly choose one of the returned completions after diverse beam search to update the policy. We generate three images per prompt and compute the average reward to reduce variance. We train the policy for 12k episodes, four PPO epochs per batch with one minibatch each, with a batch size of 256 and a constant learning rate of 5e-5. The value loss coefficient and the KL reward coefficient are kept at 2.3 and 0.2 respectively. We do not cherry-pick checkpoints and directly use the final checkpoint for evaluation. Please refer to the Appendix A for more training details and Appendix B for computational resources. 5Evaluation In order to evaluate how text-to-image models benefit from the prompt adaptation, we compare the reward value computed by two automatic predictors (Section 2.2). Moreover, we use human preference ratings to demonstrate real user feedback. We adopt beam search with a beam size of 8 and a length penalty of 1.0. We evaluate our method on held-out data from training distribution, including in-domain data from Lexica with four augmentations, in-domain data from DiffusionDB, and out-of-domain COCO data. Each category contains 256 prompts. In-domain data has corresponding manually engineered prompts for comparison, and the out-of-domain data is used to verify whether our method can generalize to new domains. Except for the user input and manually engineered baseline, we also consider the supervised finetuned model as a baseline that can reflect the importance of reinforcement learning. 3.3 Results Table 3: Images generated by user input and optimized prompts using Stable Diffusion v1.4. Each group contains three images generated with three different random seeds. We observe that optimized prompts can generate more aesthetically pleasing images than original user input.

For in-domain Lexica prompts, we evaluate on four augmentations: main content (MC), main content with random modifiers (MCM), rephrasing of main content (RMC) and rephrasing of target prompt (RTP). It is observed that source prompt augmentation in supervised fine-tuning can boost performance on both in-domain data and out-of-domain data. the average reward value. Figure 2 shows that the reward value can be improved regardless of the engineering method, which suggests the misalignment problem between user-friendly prompts and model-preferred prompts is serious. Compared with the strong baseline of manually engineered prompts, optimized prompts can still achieve considerable reward improvements. Furthermore, optimized prompts perform even better on rephrased versions (i.e., RMC, and RTP), and out-of- domain data. These prompts are more user-friendly but cause more significant reward drops on generation results, especially on the rephrasing of the main content. Benefiting from automatic prompt engineering, optimized prompts can align well between two different domains from users and text-to-image models respectively. Table 4: Evaluation of the aesthetic score and relevance score on DiffusionDB. Aesthetic Relevance User Input 5.47 0.28 Human Engineered Prompt 5.87 0.26 0.260.26 Supervised Fine-tuning 6.15 0.25 PROMPTIST (Ours) 6.26 6.266.26 0.26 0.260.26 We also present the evaluation results of the aesthetic score and relevance score respectively in Table 4. We empirically found that the generated images are relevant enough to the input prompt if the relevance score (CLIP score) is around 0.26. As mentioned at Section 2.2, we design the reward function which encourages the model to generate more aesthetically pleasing images if the relevance score is good enough. On the DiffusionDB dataset, our RL method improves the SFT baseline in terms of relevance score from 0.25 to 0.26, and the human-engineered baseline also obtains a relevance score of 0.26. Moreover, the aesthetic score of our model is improved significantly over both the human-engineered prompts and the supervised fine-tuned model. It demonstrates that our method generates images with good relevance and much better aesthetic scores. We provide some images generated by user input and its corresponding optimized prompt in Table 3. Each group consists of three images generated by different random seeds. We observe that images generated by user input are intuitively uninspiring while optimized prompts can not only retain the original intentions but also induce the model to produce more remarkable results. For example, generated images are crude when prompted with ‚ÄúA rabbit is wearing a space suit‚Äù. After prompt optimization, generated images become more bright and more expressive. Reinforcement learning can further boost the reward value. Reinforcement learning in our method is supposed to perform better on out-of-domain data through explorations. To quantify its effect, we compute the ratio of reward improvements after fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. 7Table 5: Human evaluation results. The different colors represent how many images generated by corresponding prompts are considered more aesthetically pleasing. The orange block means that both prompts produce equally pleasing images. Optimized vs. User Input Optimized vs. Manually Engineered In-Domain 72%67%49% 13%12%21% 15%21%30% 123 CHART TITLE>=< 72%67%49% 13%12%21% 15%21%30% 123 CHART TITLE>=< Out-of-Domain 72%67%49% 13%12%21% 15%21%30% 123 CHART TITLE>=< ‚Äî‚Äî As shown in Table 2, reinforcement learning brings 31%, 24%, and 71% average improvements on in-domain main content from Lexica, DiffusionDB, and out-of-domain COCO data. In-domain prompts are very similar to the data we used in supervised fine-tuning, so reward improvements are relatively saturated in the first stage and improvements of reinforcement learning on them are correspondingly smaller. Oppositely, out-of-domain data such as COCO captions are more similar to user input and unseen during the first stage. The policy must learn to adapt better to new domains through exploration, so their improvements on these prompts are more prominent. Surprisingly, although in-domain Lexica prompts and their augmentations are not used, reinforcement learning still exhibits better generalization capability on them. The boost is remarkable on those prompts that fine-tuning cannot optimize well (43% on rephrasings of main content and 127% on rephrasings of target prompt). These results suggest that given appropriate human queries, reinforcement learning can optimize them to adapt to different domains and boost reward improvements. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we also present the results of our model on Stable Diffusion v1.5 in Appendix C, comparisons with the heuristic baseline in Appendix D and the results on different categories and lengths of prompts in Appendix E. 3.4 Human evaluation The reward function of our model is defined by two automatic metrics, aesthetic score and relevance score predicted by neural networks, which may have some discrepancies from real human feedback. Therefore, we additionally evaluate whether optimized prompts actually make humans more satisfied. We generate two images for each user input and the optimized prompt. Afterward, three held-out annotators are asked to rank the two groups of images in preference order and we compute the average preference distribution. Results are shown in Table 5. We observe that annotators generally prefer images generated by optimized prompts over their original input. Compared with manually engineered prompts, optimized prompts yield less gain over user input. It suggests that the aesthetic score can measure the quality of generated images to some extent, it would be better if direct human feedback is included in the reward function. 3.5 Ablation of source prompt augmentation As described in Section 2.1, we crawl human-engineered prompts as target prompts and use the main content without any modifiers as source prompts. To enable the supervised fine-tuned model to generalize better on unseen domains, we propose different augmentation methods that improve the diversity of source prompts. We compare the fine-tuning performance with and without the augmentation strategy and results are shown in Figure 3. We observe that fine-tuning with source prompt augmentation brings consistent improvements on both in-domain held-out data and out-of- domain data. From the results on MCM, adding some random modifiers to the user input slightly obtains reward improvement but it is not as distinct as the improvement brought by fine-tuning, indicating that we should customize modifiers for each individual prompt and automatic prompt engineering is a promising way to tackle it. Compared with other data, prompts rephrased by text-davinci-002 are more difficult to optimize at the fine-tuning stage and they benefit more from reinforcement learning. Overall, source prompt augmentation makes the fine-tuned model generalize better and is important in our prompt adaptation framework. 84 Related work Prompt engineering. Manual prompt engineering is a natural way to optimize prompts. Manually designed cloze-style prompts have been used to probe knowledge from pre-trained language mod- els [Petroni et al., 2019, Dai et al., 2022]. In addition to knowledge probing, models are also prompted to handle NLP tasks with manually designed prefix prompts [Brown et al., 2020, Du et al., 2021]. Recent work has explored how to write prompts to improve performance [Wei et al., 2022]. Despite the success of manually-crafted prompts, designing prompts takes time and experience [Shin et al., 2021] and can be sub-optimal [Jiang et al., 2020]. In particular, when using text-to-image models, users have to carefully select and compose sentences to achieve a certain visual style [Liu and Chilton, 2021, Oppenlaender, 2022, Parsons, 2022]. Thus, various methods focus on automatically searching prompts by mining [Jiang et al., 2020], paraphrasing [Haviv et al., 2021], and text generation [Gao et al., 2021]. Besides, continuous prompt methods treat the prompts as additional continuous pa- rameters of pre-trained models and directly optimize the parameters on downstream tasks [Li and Liang, 2021, Tsimpoukelli et al., 2021, Zhou et al., 2022a]. However, continuous prompt methods require access to manipulating the model, and the learned prompts lack interpretability. In contrast, our methods directly optimize prompts in text format, which can fit in black-box downstream systems such as text-to-image models. Learning from human feedback. Our work is related to research on learning from human feedback, which has been widely studied in machine learning problems. Several studies propose to continually improve dialogue systems by collecting human feedback after deployment [Hancock et al., 2019, Shuster et al., 2020, Xu et al., 2022]. Besides, human feedback has also been also applied to human-in- the-loop methods for entity linking [Klie et al., 2020], semantic parsing [Yao et al., 2019], etc. Recent research on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has shown promising results on machine learning problems, ranging from classical RL tasks [Christiano et al., 2017, Ibarz et al., 2018] to a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including text summarization [Stiennon et al., 2020, Ziegler et al., 2019], dialogue [Jaques et al., 2019], and general text generation tasks [Ouyang et al., 2022]. Differently, our goal is to automatically optimize prompts for text-to-image models. Text-to-image models. Text-to-image synthesis models are typically trained to generate images conditioned on text. Text-to-image synthesis has been widely studied using GANs [Reed et al., 2016a,b, Tao et al., 2022]. More recently, text-to-image models are further improved with large-scale auto-regressive models [Ramesh et al., 2021b, Ding et al., 2021] or diffusion-based models [Rombach et al., 2022, Gu et al., 2022]. 5 Conclusion We propose to automatically optimize prompts for text-to-image models so that the user input and model-preferred prompts can be well aligned. We evaluate our method with Stable Diffusion. Experimental results show that prompt adaptation outperforms human prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning, in terms of automatic metrics and human evaluation. The exploration nature of reinforcement learning enables the model to go beyond teacher forcing, which improves generalization over out-of-domain examples. The proposed method is flexible to align human intentions and model- favored languages. Although our experiments are conducted on text-to-image models, the framework can be easily applied to other tasks for prompt adaptation. Rather than using automatic score functions as rewards, we can directly use human feedback as supervision to train a reward model [Ouyang et al., 2022]. Moreover, using a larger-size language model as the prompt interface tends to improve the optimization quality. Limitations We crawl human-engineered prompts from the Lexica website as golden prompts to guide the supervised fine-tuning process. The crawled prompts contain some biases. For example, we observe that they tend to generate more artwork instead of realistic photographs because most of them contain one or more artist names. Besides, the proportion of prompts about portraits is relatively higher than those about other categories. Although the reinforcement learning stage can mitigate these issues, it would be better to balance the art styles and objects at the beginning. Moreover, we 9currently only apply our framework to text-to-image models. As the proposed framework is general to prompt-guided generation, we will apply it to other generative models like text-only models and text-to-video models for future work.

The specific tags are presented in Table 9. We concatenate the user input with these common tags and compute their reward. The results are in Table 10. While using these common tags can improve the reward to some extent, we found that their perfor- mance varies significantly across different domains. For instance, tag3 performs well on COCO and Lexica but poorly on DiffusionDB. It suggests that relying on a handful of common hand-selected tags may not be practical in real-world scenarios. In contrast, our proposed framework can perform well across domains and improve a lot over the common tags. 15E Results on different categories and lengths of prompts We aim to validate the effectiveness of our method on different categories and different lengths. In Figure 2, we divide the prompts into several categories according to the prompt pattern, there are MC, MCM, RMC, RTP, in-domain DiffusionDB and out-of-domain COCO. Results show that optimized prompts are generally effective for all these categories. For semantic categories, these prompts have no clear boundaries. Therefore, we use RoBERTa-Large Liu et al. [2019] to get the sentence embedding of each prompt and perform K-means clustering on these prompts and divide them into five categories. We list their proportion and their reward in Table. For length ablation, we also classify them into five categories according to the length of input tokens. The results are in Table 12. We observe that the performance of different lengths and semantic categories varies slightly but our model can improve the reward generally. When conducting reinforcement learning, we build large-scale prompts from both in-domain data and out-of-domain data, which cover a wide range of prompts with different lengths and semantic categories.

The proposed method achieves signiÔ¨Åcant gains compared with recent SoTA approaches like prompt tun- ing, AutoPrompt, and RLPrompt, across a variety of tasks, including sentiment analysis, topic classiÔ¨Åcation, natural language inference, and reading comprehen- sion. Our method achieves 5.33x on average improvement in sample efÔ¨Åciency when compared to the traditional Ô¨Åne-tuning methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/tianjunz/TEMPERA. 1 I NTRODUCTION With the recent advances in pre-training large language models (Brown et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2021; Raffel et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022), prompting, or in-context learning provides a data- efÔ¨Åcient framework for performing NLU (Li & Liang, 2021; Shin et al., 2020b; Gao et al., 2020b). Such methods achieve impressive zero-shot and few-show performance in many downstream tasks. However, the prompt often has to be carefully tuned to achieve consistent performance for each task (Lu et al., 2021). For example, prompt tuning aims to optimize a continuous preÔ¨Åx embed- ding via gradient descent and directly takes generated output from the frozen pre-trained language model (Lester et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021b;a). On the contrary, discrete prompt optimization focuses on constructing meaningful instructions, in-context exemplars and verbalizers (Brown et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020b). Prior work often performs black-box optimization or applies RL-based methods for direct generation (Deng et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022; Prasad et al., 2022). Recent works in the prompt tuning Ô¨Åeld have shown that, performing instance-dependent prompt tuning (Wu et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2022) can improve the performance of some downstream tasks. The correspond- ing concept in the discrete prompt optimization domain is intriguing since it allows users to provide different instructions for different inputs and task. Unlike prompt tuning, such instructions can be more human interpretable. However, Ô¨Ånding such query-dependent prompts is often overlooked and is not feasible given the inefÔ¨Åciency of black-box optimization. In this paper, we investigate the importance of providing query-dependent discrete prompts and demonstrate how this can be achieved via efÔ¨Åcient search. To this end, we propose the concept of test-time editingthrough reinforcement learning (RL) that allows the agent to perform different editing techniques at test timeto construct query-dependent prompts efÔ¨Åciently. We formulate discrete prompt optimization as an RL problem by sequentially editing an initial prompt, which only requires high-level guidance on which part to edit and what tools to use. Dif- ferent from prior work, this formulation strikes a good balance between human prior knowledge, Ô¨Çexibility, feasibility and interpretability. The method allows easy incorporation of human knowl- edge since one can provide a manually chosen initial prompt and allow RL to perform editing on 1 arXiv:2211.11890v1  [cs.CL]  21 Nov 2022Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 it. It also achieves a balance between search Ô¨Çexibility and feasibility because by enabling different editing techniques, the prompt can be transformed to very different forms but the search space is more feasible compared to direct generation. The Ô¨Ånal prompt is also more interpretable since the editing tools we adopted usually do not change the semantic meaning of the sentence. 100 200 300 400 500 Number of Training Examples 0.65 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85Classification Performance Data Efficiency for TEMPERA Finetuning TEMPERA Figure 1: Data EfÔ¨Åciency for TEMPERA: We comopare the data efÔ¨Åciency of TEMPERA and standard Ô¨Åne-tuning in a few-shot setting. Results are averaged across four tasks: SST2, AG News, RTE and MR. It shows that our method achieves comparable performance using 4x fewer examples. To summarize, we propose to construct query- dependent prompts through test-time editing and formulate this as an RL problem. We carefully design the action space, enabling the agent to Ô¨Çexibly edit the instructions, in-context exem- plars and verbalizers. To better train the RL agent, we propose using the score difference be- tween consecutive prompts before and after edit- ing as rewards and developing a set of techniques that help improve the Ô¨Ånal performance (e.g., re- ward normalization). We also adopt an attention- based policy architecture to attend over possible candidates or design choices, and show this can be effective for RL training. Following the standard few-shot text classiÔ¨Å- cation setting, we benchmark our algorithm extensively on multiple tasks (including those from GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) and Super- GLUE (Wang et al., 2019)). We show that TEM- PERA can achieve SoTA performance (e.g.,1.8% better in SST-2 and3.9% better in CR) compared to few-shot Ô¨Ånetuning, prompt tuning and discrete prompt optimization. We also show that TEM- PERA is on 4x more data efÔ¨Åcient (over the average of 4 tasks SST2, MR, AG News and RTE) compared with traditional Ô¨Ånetuning methods (Figure 1). In addition, we perform extensive abla- tions on different aspects of the proposed algorithm. We demonstrate that TEMPERA is robust to the prompt pool size and the number of few-shot exemplars. 2 R ELATED WORK Prompting in language models and sensitivity to prompts. Recent research has shown that as language models scale up, new capabilities could be unlocked such as in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020), where the language model is prompted with a few in-context demonstrations and learns to perform a certain task in a sample-efÔ¨Åcient way. However, several works have studied the in- context learning ability more closely and found that the task performance can be highly sensitive to how the in-context prompt is written. For example, Lu et al. (2022) found that the prompt order can have a large effect on the Ô¨Ånal task performance; Zhao et al. (2021) show that the choice of prompt format, training examples, and prompt order can cause the performance to vary quite signiÔ¨Åcantly. Automatic prompt generation and search. To address such sensitivity in language models, mul- tiple approaches have been proposed for better prompt generation. In the continuous space, Lester et al. (2021) propose prompt-tuning to add tunable tokens for each task during the Ô¨Åne-tuning stage to improve task performance. Zhong et al. (2021) propose OptiPrompt that optimizes the prompts in the input embedding space directly for factual probing. More recently, Wu et al. (2022) found performing instance-independent prompt-tuning can further boost the performance. In the discrete space, Gao et al. (2020a) propose prompt-based Ô¨Åne-tuning and utilize pre-trained models to au- tomatically generate prompt templates. Schick & Sch ¬®utze (2021) and Schick et al. (2020) use a small amount of training data to automatically identify the best label words to use for few-shot clas- siÔ¨Åcation. Shin et al. (2020a) propose AutoPrompt to perform gradient-guided search to Ô¨Ånd the best tokens in the prompt, although the best prompts found are usually not interpretable by humans. Jiang et al. (2020) propose mining-based and paraphrasing-based methods to generate meaningful and diverse prompts for factual knowledge probing. Related to our work, Deng et al. (2022) propose an RL-based framework to directly generate better prompts via black-box optimization. Different 2Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 from existing work, our approach frames the problem as test-time prompt editing with an RL-based framework to perform efÔ¨Åcient search in the editing space. EfÔ¨Åcient training exemplar retrieval as prompts. In addition, existing work has shown the choice of the exemplars can also be critical to the Ô¨Ånal performance. For example, Liu et al. (2022) propose to retrieve exemplars from a training pool that are semantically similar to a test example, and show it can signiÔ¨Åcantly boost the performance. Rubin et al. (2022) trained a dense retriever to efÔ¨Åciently retrieve good training examples as prompts during test time. In this work, we show that an attention-based exemplar selection process over the embedding space can effectively choose performant training examples within our RL framework. 3 T EST-TIME PROMPT EDITING We formulate the task of test-time editing in this section. We give some background on the few- shot text classiÔ¨Åcation and how to use prompts for downstream NLP tasks. Then we formalize a new setting called test-time editingwhere users are allowed to perform editing over a given prompt, depending on the given input and task during test time. 3.1 B ACKGROUND Few-Shot Text ClassiÔ¨Åcation. Following the standard few-shot language model classiÔ¨Åcation set- ting (Brown et al., 2020), we assume that we are given a pretrained language model Land wish to perform classiÔ¨Åcation on dataset Dwith label space Y. Assume we are given K samples per class from the training set, the new few-shot training set is given as Dtrain = {xi,yi}K√ó|Y| i=1 . In addition, there is a hold-out test dataset Dtest that we use for evaluation on downstream NLP tasks. Optimizing Discrete Prompts. Prompt-based few-shot learning considers the following prob- lem: given a piece of text p as a prompt, we use the generative distribution of the language model PL(y|p,x) to perform various NLP tasks without Ô¨Åne-tuning the model. In particular, for a given objective R, we propose to perform the desired optimization over the prompt by Ô¨Ånding an optimal p‚àó = arg minp‚ààVR(PL(y|p,x)). In this paper, we focus on restricting the prompt p as a piece of text instead of letting p to be any vector in the latent space. This not only provides more inter- pretability of the prompt, but also allows us to use existing natural language tools (e.g., NLTK (Bird et al., 2009)) to perform a discrete search for constructing better prompts. Different Forms of Discrete Prompts. We consider three popular forms of discrete prompts: (1) Instructions, which provide a segment of text describing how the task is performed, usually put at the beginning. (2) In-Context Demonstrations {e0,e1,...,e k}, which selects several examples and their corresponding labels, usually placed before the query. (3) Verbalization, which aims to design how the task is asked and which keywords to select as labels. See Figure 2 for an example of different transformations that we perform when editing in our RL-based framework. 3.2 T EST-TIME EDITING Prior works have often attempted to identify a query-agnostic prompt (Deng et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022) or attempted to directly generate a query-dependent prompt via hyper-networks learning (He et al., 2022). However, query-agnostic prompting fails to incorporate any query-related information into the prompts and directly generating prompts for each individual query is challenging (due to its difÔ¨Åculty to incorporate human prior knowledge or feedback). In addition, by permuting the order of in-context exemplars {e0,e1,...,e k}(Lu et al., 2022) or searching for the knearest neighbors of the current test instance (Liu et al., 2022) as in-context exemplars yields better performance. These reveal the importance of constructing query-dependent prompts. Unlike prior methods, we perform prompt editing at test-time. The procedure works as follows: at test time, one is given an initial promptp0. We want to learn a functionfthat takes the initial prompt p0, query x and a pool of examples/verbalizers p‚Ä≤, and outputs a Ô¨Ånal prompt: pf = f(p0,x,p‚Ä≤). The overall framework of our algorithm is shown in Fig. 2. We allow f to make edits (e.g., editing verbalizers and/or swapping examples) over the original prompt to make it more suitable for the 3Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Figure 2: Test-Time Editing via RL: The RL agent is trained to optimize the performance of a downstream task. At test-time, given a query, the agent adopts an attention-based policy to edit the instructions, in-context exemplars and verbalizers for T rounds.

Since the editing function f can depend on the query x, we call it the test-time editing function. Note that we train the function f in a Ô¨Åxed training dataset and directly deploy it at test time without any addition training. This is different from the test-time optimization since we don‚Äôt have access to the ground truth label or a surrogate objective. Plese see Algorithm.1 for details. 4 T EST-TIME EDITING VIA REINFORCEMENT LEARNING In order to learn the test-time editing function f, we present a novel RL-based framework that naturally maps the editing process to an MDP. We will present our framework and discuss how we design the state space, action space and reward in this section. Reinforcement Learning Formulation. We formulate test-time editing as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Given an initial state, s = (p0,x), consisting of an initial prompt and a query, at each time step t, the RL agent selects one of the editing methods from the action space A. We can then deÔ¨Åne the transition function T : S√óA‚ÜíSto be the state of prompt before and after editing (pt,x) √óat ‚Üí (pt+1,x). That is, the transition dynamics are deterministic given the editing action. We can either deÔ¨Åne a Ô¨Åxed horizon H or design a termination function to stop editing and get the Ô¨Ånal prompt. The goal is to maximize the expected reward R = E[‚àëT k=0 Œ≥krk] where rt is the reward and Œ≥ is the discount factor. We introduce in detail each component of the state representation, action space and rewards in the following subsections. 4Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Table 1: Effect of different editing techniques. For instruction, we tokenize it into phrases and perform swapping, addition or deletion. We also allow swapping in-context exemplars or changing different verbalizers. Before Editing After Editing Instruction Swap ‚ÄúGiven text, classify whether it is good or bad.‚Äù ‚ÄúClassify whether it is good or bad, given text.‚Äù Add ‚ÄúGiven text, classify whether it is good or bad.‚Äù ‚ÄúGiven text, given text, Classify whether it is good or bad.‚Äù Delete ‚ÄúGiven text, classify whether it is good or bad.‚Äù ‚ÄúClassify whether it is good or bad.‚Äù Example Permute {Example 1, Example 2, ..., Example k} { Example k, Example 3, ..., Example 1 } Swap {Example 1, Example 2, ..., Example k} { Example k+ 1, Example n, ..., Example 1 } Verbalizer Change {‚Äúpositive‚Äù, ‚Äúnegative‚Äù} { ‚Äúgreat‚Äù, ‚Äúterrible‚Äù} State Representation. The RL framework is general and Ô¨Çexible about the representation of states. The only requirement is that such representation contains text information. Instead of di- rectly using the raw text representation, we use the last hidden states of the pretrained language model st = L(pt,x) as the state representation and feed it into the policy network. Action Space Design. We include most of the editing actions in our action space. At each stage, the RL agent can choose the editing objects from instruction, in-context exemplars or verbalizer. For editing the instruction, we provide the initial instruction from natural instructions (Wang et al., 2022). Then we tokenize the instruction into phrase level using NLTK (Bird et al., 2009) and perform swapping, deletion or addition of different phrases. Suppose we havelphrases, the action space size will become (l√ó(l‚àí1))/2 + 2l. For the in-context exemplars, we keep an example pool of N, initialize our prompt by randomly choose n of them as the initial prompt. We then allow the agent to directly perform swapping one example from the current prompt with either another one from the current prompt or from the pool of examples that are not currently used. This results in an action space for the RL agent of n√óN ‚àí(n√ó(n‚àí1))/2 since we do not allow swapping with the same example. For the verbalizer, we allow the RL agent to freely choose which verbalizer to use for each in- context example from PromptSource (Bach et al., 2022). We also will enable the agent to freely choose which verbalizer to use for each query x. Interestingly we found that this helps boost the performance of our algorithm. We provide some examples of the editing process in Tab. 1. Reward Design. We adopt the step reward proposed in RLPrompt (Deng et al., 2022). For each query x, we get the log probability of the output label from the language model log PL(ÀÜy|x,pt) given the proposed prompt pt with the correct label c, and we deÔ¨Åne the score difference s(c) as: s(c,x,pt) =Œª1 log PL(ÀÜyc|x,pt) ‚àíŒª2 arg max c‚Ä≤Ã∏=c log PL(ÀÜyc‚Ä≤ |x,pt) (1) where we have introduceed the two balancing hyperparameters Œª1 >0 and Œª2 >0 for the positive and negative terms respectively. Intuitively, this score gives a negative reward when the prediction is not correct and a positive reward otherwise. The goal is to optimize the score for the Ô¨Ånal prompt. However, RL aims to optimize the accumulated reward during the MDP process while prompt design only cares about the performance of the Ô¨Ånal prompt. Thus, we propose to use the score difference between successive edits as the immediate reward: rt = s(c,x,pt) ‚àís(c,x,pt‚àí1) (2) Ignoring the discounting factor Œ≥, this makes the accumulated reward from time 0 to T correspond to the score difference between the Ô¨Ånal and the initial prompt s(c,x,pT) ‚àís(c,x,p0). Now the objective of RL is to maximize the score difference. Attention-Based Policy Architecture. We adopt an attention-based policy architecture for the reinforcement learning agent. We put attention over a graph of possible candidates and let the agent choose which editing technique to perform. We Ô¨Ånd that the attention-based architecture helps the agent to emphasize the important examples (e.g., examples that are more semantically similar to the test instance). 5Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 We use the PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) algorithm in our experiments. The detailed hyperparameter used can be found in Appendix. A. We list here a couple of very important techniques we used in our experiments. We found these techniques are crucial to the success of our RL-based framework. Observation Normalization: Since we take the last hidden states of the language model as ob- servation, it might have very small variances between different samples. We keep a running mean and standard deviation for the observation and normalize it before feeding it to the policy and value network. This is commonly used in RL and we found this boosts the performance of our method. Reward Normalization: For different training samples, performing editing over prompts may result in signiÔ¨Åcantly different reward scales. For some of the samples, different prompts might have very marginal effects on the Ô¨Ånal prediction, either due to the fact that the model is already conÔ¨Ådent about the prediction since it is too easy, or the task sample is too hard to predict and the model is confused regardless of what prompt it is fed. On the other hand, for other training samples, editing prompts might bring a huge difference in terms of the accuracy. Thus, we perform sample-wise reward normalization to ensure that the reward scale between samples is relatively consistent. Conditioning Policy on Action History: Directly taking the observation from the language model can be inefÔ¨Åcient since the policy has no clue about how it has reached the current state. This will bring a loop that the policy will edit prompts pA ‚ÜípB and then pB ‚ÜípA. To mitigate this effect, we build a policy that not only takes in the current hidden state, but also conditioned on the action history on how it gets to the current state. Thus, we break the loop between two prompts by considering how each state is reached. 5 E XPERIMENTS Our experiments Ô¨Årst reveal the effectiveness of TEMPERA in the few-shot setting. We compare TEMPERA with prior baselines like Finetuning (Devlin et al., 2019), Soft Prompt Tuning (Lester et al., 2021), Black-Box Tuning (Sun et al., 2022), RLPrompt (Deng et al., 2022) and other manually tuned prompt methods. On various tasks from GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) and SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019), our method achieves impressive performance comparing to prior baselines. This shows that only using a small amount of training examples is sufÔ¨Åcient for RL and TEMPERA is sample efÔ¨Åcient. We also illustrate the data efÔ¨Åciency of our method compared to Ô¨Ånetuning, showing that TEMPERA can achieve same performance with 5.33x less data. In addition to the performance gains, we aim to understand our method from different aspects. In Sec. 5.2, we study how much test-time editing helps compared to query-agnostic prompts. Our experiments demonstrate the importance of test-time editing and the necessity of query-dependent prompts. In Sec. 5.4, we show that how different editing techniques (e.g, instruction, in-context demonstration and verbalization) affect the Ô¨Ånal performance of the downstream task. We also ablate the number of in-context demonstrations used and the size of the example pool in Sec. 5.6 and Sec. 5.7. Finally, we show some example prompts after editing to illustrate the editing policy. Tasks. We conduct our experiments from different categories including single-sentence tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis including SST-2, Yelp reviews, MR, CR, topic classiÔ¨Åcation including AG News). For one-sentence tasks, the goal is to make a prediction based on the sentence. We also include tasks from different types like NLI (e.g., SST-2) and multiple choices (e.g., AG News). Most of the tasks are from the standard GLUE (Wang et al., 2018). Task Settings. To ensure a fair comparison, we follow the same setting from LM-BFF (Gao et al., 2020b) and RLPrompt (Deng et al., 2022), we test TEMPERA on few-shot text classiÔ¨Åcation tasks. The setting is devised as follows: We randomly sample 16 training samples per class from the training dataset of each task and use them as the few-shot dataset. This will result in a total of 16 √ó|Y| training samples (please refer to Appendix. E for the number of classes in each task). We also randomly sample 16 samples per class as the validation dataset. For reporting the Ô¨Ånal performance, we use the standard test set and the detailed information can be found at Appendix E. In addition to the common setup, we also randomly select n examples from the training dataset as the in-context exemplar pool. We average our runs for 4 random seeds and report the average performance and corresponding standard deviation. For the language model, we useL= RoBERTa- large (Liu et al., 2019). For the details of these settings and tasks, please refer to Appendix. E. The 6Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 initial instruction is taken from the Natural Instructions (Mishra et al., 2021). The initial in context demonstrations are randomly sampled from a Ô¨Åxed example pool of size 16 and the example pool is also randomly sampled from the training dataset, different from the few-shot dataset that used for training the RL policy. Baselines. We compare TEMPERA with several SoTA prompt tuning and discrete prompt opti- mization baselines (including Ô¨Ånetuning). ‚Ä¢ Finetuning: it Ô¨Ånetunes the entire language model with a classiÔ¨Åcation head using the few-shot dataset. ‚Ä¢ Manual Prompt: we take the handcrafted prompt from (Bach et al., 2022). ‚Ä¢ Black-Box Tuning: it is a mixture of discrete and soft prompt. The soft part is trained using gradient descent and the discrete part is optimized using gradient-free tuner. ‚Ä¢ AutoPrompt: it adds the discrete trigger token and updates the prompts by iterative gradient search. ‚Ä¢ In-Context Demonstration: it randomly selects one training example and concatenates them with the input query. ‚Ä¢ Instructions: Following Natural Instructions (Wang et al., 2022), prompts are manually created instruction for each task. Each prompt is concatenated with inputs. Details are in Appendix. D. ‚Ä¢ GrIPS: it performs phrase level editing on the instructions and selects the best one. ‚Ä¢ RLPrompt: it generates discrete prompts using RL framework. 5.1 F EW-SHOT TEXT CLASSIFICATION Following the settings in existing work, we evaluate our model on some few-shot text classiÔ¨Åcation tasks. In Tab. 2, We compare our method with various baselines including RLPrompt. We can see that on most tasks we tested, TEMPERA outperforms previous baselines by a large margin. For example, we have a 1.8% absolute gain on the SST-2 task (over RLPrompt), 3.9% gain on the CR task and the performance is almost comparable to Ô¨Ånetuning the language model on the AG News task. We also see that our method results in a much smaller variance between runs than Soft Prompt Tuning and AutoPrompt, indicating that it is more stable across different few-shot datasets. Comparing to search-based methods (e.g., Black-Box Tuning or GrIPS), our method avoids the expensive run-time search if one wants to perform test-time editing using one of the black-box optimization methods with a surrogate reward. Note since the original Black-Box Tuning or GrIPS paper didn‚Äôt perform query-dependent search, this is our conjecture. Thus, out method achieves both test-time efÔ¨Åciency and good performances on downstream tasks. Table 2: Few-shot classiÔ¨Åcation results. We compare against different baselines in this setting. Results show that TEMPERA surpasses various baselines including Ô¨Ånetuning, prompt tuning and discrete prompt search. The standard deviations are shown in brackets. SST-2 Yelp P.

Results show that we can achieve a good performance with signiÔ¨Åcantly less data (varying from 4x to 8x). 5.2 I MPORTANCE OF TEST-TIME PROMPT EDITING To illustrate the importance of test-time prompt editing, we compare our method with various base- lines that do not perform test-time editing. In addition, we also construct another baseline where we create a RL based method where the policy is not dependent on the input queryx, denoted as ‚ÄúTEM- PERA (No TTE)‚Äù. Results in Tab. 3 show that TEMPERA even without test-time editing can Ô¨Ånd better query-agnostic prompts comparing to manually construct prompts, in-context demonstration and GrIPS. However, adding test-time editing can further improve the performance when the task is harder: we got 0.8% improvement on MR task and 3.0% improvement at AG News task. On SST-2, the effect of test-time editing is not signiÔ¨Åcant as we suspect that the task is too easy. We found on harder tasks like AG News, the gain of test-time editing is huge. Table 3: We compare our method against differ- ent methods which do not perform test-time edit- ing. Results show that test-time editing is mostly helpful in harder tasks like AG News. SST-2 MR AG News Manual Prompt 82.8 80.9 76.9 In-Context Demo. 85.9 80.6 74.9 Instructions 89.0 85.2 54.8 GrIPS 87.1 87.1 65.4 TEMPERA (No TTE) 92.0 87.4 81.3 TEMPERA 91.9 88.2 84.3 Table 4: Ablation on different editing techniques. Results show that adding verbalizer-edits helps all the tasks (especially MR and AG News). Adding instruction-edits marginally helps the performance in SST-2 and MR. SST-2 MR AG News TEMPERA (No Inst & Verb) 91.2 87.2 82.2 TEMPERA (No Inst) 91.9 88.2 84.3 TEMPERA 92.4 88.4 85.5 5.3 D ATA EFFICIENCY FOR TEMPERA To illustrate the data efÔ¨Åciency of our method, we compare the performance of TEMPERA with some few-shot standard Ô¨Ånetuning results in Fig. 3. We see that in SST-2, we achieve similar perfor- mance using almost 8x fewer training data. In tasks like Yelp, the gain is about 4x. We see that with fewer examples, TEMPERA strictly dominates Ô¨Åne-tuning methods. This is critical when applying TEMPERA in the real-world application since labeled data is expensive to get. 5.4 Q UALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE EDITS We also visualize our policy by taking a few examples from the Ô¨Ånal prompts after editing in Tab. 5. We see that our method mostly does example selection, verbalizer swapping and phrase-level in- struction editing. Our editing techniques are Ô¨Çexible and the Ô¨Ånal prompt may take different combi- nations for each query. In addition, the resulting Ô¨Ånal prompt is still interpretable by human, showing that our method achieves Ô¨Çexibility and interpretability at the same time. Note that in the examples provided in Tab. 1, our policy choose to modify the example selection and verbalization. 8Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Table 5: Qualitative results on the effect of the learned policy. We see that our method both enables the Ô¨Çexibility of various edits and interpretability of the Ô¨Ånal results. On the contrary, many prior methods produce non-readable prompts. Red text is prior to editing and blue text are the changes. SST-2 Before Edit ‚ÄúIn this task, you are given sentences from movie reviews.

Answer:<mask>.‚Äù Table 6: Ablation on the number of in-context exemplars. Results show that increasing the number of examples results in a consistent in- crease of performance except for AG News (which is due to the length limit). SST-2 MR AG News TEMPERA (2 Examples) 91.6 87.9 84.0 TEMPERA (4 Examples) 91.9 88.2 84.3 TEMPERA (8 Examples)92.4 88.4 82.2 Table 7: Ablation on the size of the prompt pool to select from. We see that the performance does not change too much when changing the size of the pool, indicating that the performance is rela- tively stable. SST-2 MR AG News TEMPERA (Pool Size 8) 91.6 87.9 84.1 TEMPERA (Pool Size 16) 91.9 88.2 84.3 TEMPERA (Pool Size 32)92.2 88.4 84.7 5.5 A BLATION : D IFFERENT EDITING TECHNIQUES We ablate on the different editing techniques and study how adding or removing them can affect the performance. The results are shown in Tab. 4. We can see that adding each component (e.g., verbalizer, instruction) is helpful in terms of the Ô¨Ånal performance. We also Ô¨Ånd that verbalizer is es- pecially helpful in some tasks like AG News, resulting in a 1.2% difference in the Ô¨Ånal performance. This indicates that adding more Ô¨Çexibility to some extent can help the performance. 5.6 A BLATION : N UMBER OF SHOTS We also ablate on the number of examples used in the in-context demonstration part of our algorithm. We choose the size of 2, 4 and 8 for the analysis. We see that from Tab. 6, in all the tasks we tested (SST-2, MR and AG News), increasing the number of examples consistently improves the performance. However, the performance improvement is relatively limited. In addition, due to the input length limit constraint by the language model (512 for RoBERTa), longer sequences of input will be truncated. This results in the performance decrease when increasing the number of examples from 4 to 8 for AG News, where the input length is longer than 512. 5.7 A BLATION : S IZE OF THE PROMPT POOL We also ablate on the example size of the prompt pool where we keep the number of examplers of 4. Intuitively, allowing our method to choose in-context demonstrations from a large range of example pool can provide better prompts. From Table. 7, we can see that increasing the example pool size gives the algorithm more Ô¨Çexibility to choose in-context demonstrations, resulting in a slightly better Ô¨Ånal performance. 6 C ONCLUSION In this paper we present TEMPERA, a test-time prompt editing method for large language models via reinforcement learning. We found that perform test-time editing can greatly improve the perfor- mance of downstream tasks for a pretrained language model. The proposed method only requires little guidance on high-level search space design and can easily incorporate prior human knowledge. 9Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 It achieves SoTA performance on multiple benchmarks including those from GLUE. This intersec- tion area of research between NLP and RL can inspire future research on designing better test-time editing algorithms for practical usage. REFERENCES Stephen H.

We use standard PPO algorithm to do online policy optimiza- tion with GAE. We provide all the hyperparameters here for a reference. We‚Äôll specify our neural network architecture in the following section. Note that we perform additional observation normal- ization (i.e., keeping a running mean and std) and reward normalization. We also adopt the same number of parallel environment as the few-shot setting (e.g., 32 in our few-shot experiments). We found a large size of parallel environment helps boost the performance.

Note that our policy and baseline network shares the same attention-based encoder. The attention is Ô¨Çat over all the possible candidate examples. We use a 3-layer encoder block with 3 heads and 48 latent dimension. We build two different head with 2-layer MLP for each as the policy head and baseline head. We also don‚Äôt use dropout for the policy learning part. We found this boost up the performance. C A DDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS We perform additional experiments on some more tasks like RTE, QNLI, SNLI, MNLI and MRPC. Results show that we are consistently better than most of the discrete prompt optimization methods and continuous prompt tuning methods. On several tasks, we are also better than Ô¨Ånetuning the entire model. D N ATURAL INSTRUCTIONS AND PROMPTSOURCE We provide all the instructions we used in our experiments from Natural Instructions.

Experimental results on various tasks demonstrate that the lan- guage agents improve over time and that our approach considerably outperforms baselines that do not properly leverage gradients from the environment. 1 I NTRODUCTION Recently, we have seen the emergence of a powerful new trend in which large language models (LLMs) are augmented to become autonomous language action agents capable of performing tasks on their own, ultimately in the service of a goal, rather than responding to queries from human users. Prominent studies, including ReAct (Yao et al., 2023), Toolformer (Schick et al., 2023), Hugging- GPT (Shen et al., 2023), Generative Agents (Park et al., 2023), WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021), AutoGPT (Gravitas, 2023), BabyAGI (Nakajima, 2023), and Langchain (Chase, 2023), have suc- cessfully showcased the viability of creating autonomous decision-making agents by leveraging the capabilities of LLMs. These approaches use LLMs to generate text-based outputs and actions that can be further employed for making API calls and executing operations within a given environment. Given the immense scale of LLMs with an extensive parameter count, the behaviors of most existing language agents, however, are not optimized or aligned with environment reward functions. An exception is a very recent language agent architecture, namely Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023), and several other related work, e.g., Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023b) and Generative Agents (Park et al., 2023), which use verbal feedback, namely self-reflection, to help agents learn from prior failure. These reflective agents convert binary or scalar reward from the environment into verbal feedback in the form of a textual summary, which is then added as additional context to the prompt for the language agent. The self-reflection feedback acts as a semantic signal by providing the agent with a concrete direction to improve upon, helping it learn from prior mistakes and prevent repetitive errors to perform better in the next attempt. Although the self-reflection operation enables iterative refinement, generating useful reflective feed- back from a pre-trained, frozen LLM is challenging, as showcased in Fig. 1, since it requires the *Corresponding Authors ‚Ä†Website for Retroformer & demos: https://Retroformer.github.io/ ‚Ä°Code: https://github.com/weirayao/Retroformer 1 arXiv:2308.02151v3  [cs.CL]  5 May 2024Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 LLM to have a good understanding of where the agent made mistakes in a specific environment, i.e., the credit assignment problem (Sutton & Barto, 2018), as well as the ability to generate a summary containing actionable insights for improvement. The verbal reinforcement cannot be optimal, if the frozen language model has not been properly fine-tuned to specialize in credit assignment problems for the tasks in given environments. Furthermore, the existing language agents do not reason and plan in ways that are compatible with differentiable, gradient-based learning from rewards by ex- ploiting the existing abundant reinforcement learning techniques. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Retroformer, a principled framework for reinforcing language agents by learn- ing a plug-in retrospective model, which automatically refines the language agent prompts from environment feedback through policy optimization. Specifically, our proposed agent architecture can learn from arbitrary reward information across multiple environments and tasks, for iteratively fine-tuning a pre-trained language model, which refines the language agent prompts by reflecting on failed attempts and assigning credits of actions taken by the agent on future rewards. Lollipop Chainsaw featured Juliet Starling, who was voiced by a Canadian-American actress who has done voice roles for what Teen Titans spinoff series?1.Task instruction Action 1: Search[Juliet Starling] Action 2: Search[Lollipop Chainsaw] Action 3: Search[Tara Strong] Action 4: Finish[Teen Titans and Teen Titans Go!] 2.Action sequences in prior trial I should have searched for Lollipop Chainsaw first and looked up the Canadian-American actress who voiced Juliet Starling afterwards. I also should have looked up Tara Strong's filmography and searched for any voice roles she did specifically for Teen Titans or Teen Titans Go! 3.Verbal feedback (self-reflection) Action 1: Search[Lollipop Chainsaw] Action 2: Search[Tara Strong] Action 3: Finish[Teen Titans, Teen Titans Go!]  4.Action sequences in next trial +add to agent prompt Figure 1: An example of uninformative self-reflections from a frozen LLM. The root cause of failure in prior trial is that the agent should have only submitted the spinoff series ‚ÄúTeen Titans Go‚Äù and not ‚ÄúTeen Titans‚Äù in the answer. The agent forgot its goal during a chain of lengthy interactions. The verbal feedback from a frozen LLM, however, only rephrases the prior failed actions sequences as the proposed plan, resulting repetitive, incorrect actions in the next trial. We conduct experiments on a number of real-world tasks including HotPotQA (Yang et al., 2018), which involves search-based question answering tasks, AlfWorld (Shridhar et al., 2021), in which the agent solves embodied robotics tasks through low-level text actions, and WebShop (Yao et al., 2022), a browser environment for web shopping. We observe Retroformer agents are faster learners compared with Reflexion, which does not use gradient for reasoning and planning, and are better decision-makers and reasoners. More concretely,Retroformer agents improve the success rate in HotPotQA by 18% with 4 retries, 36% in AlfWorld with 3 retries and 4% in WebShop, which demonstrate the effectiveness of gradient-based learning for LLM action agents. To summarize, our contributions are the following: ‚Ä¢ The paper introduces Retroformer, which iteratively refines the prompts given to large lan- guage agents based on environmental feedback to improve learning speed and task completion. We take a policy gradient approach with the Actor LLM being part of the environment, allowing learning from a wide range of reward signals for diverse tasks. ‚Ä¢ The proposed method focuses on fine-tuning the retrospective model in the language agent sys- tem architecture, without accessing the Actor LLM parameters or needing to propagate gradients through it. The agnostic nature of Retroformer makes it a flexible plug-in module for various types of cloud-based LLMs, such as OpenAI GPT or Google Bard. 2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 2 R ELATED WORK Autonomous Language Agents We summarize in Table 1 the recent language agent literature related to our work from five perspectives and differentiate our method from them. The completion of a complex task typically involves numerous stages. An AI agent must possess knowledge of these stages and plan accordingly. Chain-of-Thoughts or CoT (Wei et al., 2022) is the pioneering work that prompts the agent to decompose challenging reasoning tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. ReAct (Yao et al., 2023), on the other hand, proposes the exploitation of this reasoning and acting proficiency within LLM to encourage interaction with the environment (e.g. using the Wikipedia search API) by mapping observations to the generation of reasoning and action traces or API calls in natural language. This agent architecture has spawned various applications, such as HuggingGPT (Shen et al., 2023), Generative Agents (Park et al., 2023), WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021), AutoGPT (Gravitas, 2023), and BabyAGI (Nakajima, 2023). Table 1: Related work on large language agents. Approach Gradient Arbitrary Iterative Hidden Decision Memory learning reward refinement constraints making CoT (Wei et al., 2022) ‚úó ‚úó ‚úó ‚úó ‚úó ‚úó ReAct (Yao et al., 2023) ‚úó ‚úó ‚úó ‚úì ‚úì ‚úì Self-refine (Madaan et al., 2023b) ‚úó ‚úó ‚úì ‚úó ‚úó ‚úó RAP (Hao et al., 2023) ‚úó ‚úó ‚úì ‚úì ‚úì ‚úì Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023) ‚úó ‚úó ‚úì ‚úì ‚úì ‚úì Retroformer(our method) ‚úì ‚úì ‚úì ‚úì ‚úì ‚úì However, these approaches fail to learn from valuable feedback, such as environment rewards, to en- hance the agent‚Äôs behaviors, resulting in performances that are solely dependent on the quality of the pre-trained LLM. Self-refine (Madaan et al., 2023a) addresses this limitation by employing a single LLM as a generator, refiner, and provider of feedback, allowing for iterative refinement of outputs. However, it is not specifically tailored for real-world task-based interaction with the environment. On the other hand, RAP (Hao et al., 2023) repurposes the LLM to function as both a world model and a reasoning agent. It incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search for strategic exploration within the extensive realm of reasoning with environment rewards. This approach enables effective naviga- tion and decision-making in complex domains. Recently, Shinn et al. (2023) presents Reflexion, a framework that equips agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities, enhancing their reasoning skills. Self-reflection plays a pivotal role, allowing autonomous agents to iteratively refine past actions, make improvements, and prevent repetitive errors. Transformer Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning with a provided reward function or a reward-labeled dataset, commonly referred to as RLHF, has become a standard practice within the LLM fine-tuning pipeline. These endeavors have convincingly demonstrated the efficacy of RL as a means to guide language models towards desired behaviors that align with predefined reward functions encompassing various domains, including machine translation, summarization, and gen- erating favorable reviews. Among the prevalent transformer RL methods are online RL algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization or PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), and offline RL techniques such as Implicit Language Q-Learning or ILQL (Snell et al., 2022) and Direct Preference Optimiza- tion or DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023). These methods have been implemented in TRL /TRLX (von Werra et al., 2020; Max et al., 2023) distributed training framework. 3 N OTATION AND FORMULATION In this work, we denote a large language model (LLM) based action agent as a functionMŒæl : X ‚Üí A, where X is the space of prompts, which may include the actual promptsxu provided by the users, as well as some contextual information c ‚àà C. Here C is the space of context as a representation of the current state S returned by the environment ‚Ñ¶. A is the space of actions. Note the actions taken by most language model based agents are sampled auto-repressively, so M is a random function. The subscript Œæl denotes the re-parameterized random variables involved in the sampling process. Another note is, the LLM-based agent itself is stateless. All the states and possible memorization are characterized as text in the agent prompt x. 3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 The environment is defined as a tuple (TŒæo, R). TŒæo : S √ó A ‚Üí Sis the state transition function, where S is the space of states and A is the action space. Here we assume the states and actions are represented using text. Again we usedŒæo to represent the randomness involved in the state transition. For each state s ‚àà S, a reward function is defined asR : S ‚ÜíR. At each step of the play, the states is described using natural language, and integrated into the context c. In the context, previous states may also be described and embedded to help LLMs making a good guess on the next action to take. As in all the reinforcement learning setting, the final goal is to maximize the cumulative rewards, or episode returns Gcum = PT t=0 R(st). In many situations, the rewards are sparse, i.e., R(st) are mostly zero except very few states, such as in the terminal state for indicating task success or failure. The retrospective model takes the all the previous states s1,¬∑¬∑¬∑,t, actions a1,¬∑¬∑¬∑,t, rewards r1,¬∑¬∑¬∑,t, and the user prompt xu as input, and massage them into a new prompt x to be consumed by the LLM: ŒìŒær,Œò : [Si, Ai, Ri, Xu i ]t i=1 ‚Üí X, (1) where Œær stands for the randomness involved in the retrospective model, andŒò is the set of learnable parameters in the retrospective model. The goal of the RL optimization is arg max Œò EŒæl,Œæo,Œær \" TX t=1 R(st) # s.t. st+1 = TŒæo \u0000 st, LŒæl ‚ó¶ ŒìŒær,Œò \u0000 [si, ai, ri, xu i ]t i=1 \u0001\u0001 , ‚àÄt ‚àà {1, ¬∑¬∑¬∑ , T‚àí 1} (2) Note that the only learnable parameters are in the retrospective model Mr. Since LLM action agent is frozen, it can be considered as part of the environment. Specifically, if we construct another environment with the transition function T ‚Ä≤ = T (S, ‚Ä¢) ‚ó¶ L: S √ó X ‚Üí S, and the same reward function R, then Eq. (2) is just a regular RL optimization so all the popular RL algorithms apply. 4 O UR APPROACH : R EINFORCING RETROSPECTIVE LANGUAGE AGENT As illustrated in Fig. 2, our proposed framework Retroformer is comprised of two language model components: an actor LLM, denoted as Ma, which generates reasoning thoughts and actions, and a retrospective LLM, denoted as Mr, which generates verbal reinforcement cues to assist the actor in self-improvement by refining the actor prompt with reflection responses.

(a) The retrospective agent system (Sec. 4.1) contains two LLMs communicating to refine agent prompts with environment feedback. (b) The retrospective LM is fine-tuned with response ratings using proximal policy optimization (Sec. 4.2). We assume in this paper that the actor model is a frozen LLM whose model parameters are inac- cessable (e.g., OpenAI GPT) and the retrospective model is a smaller, local language model that can be fine-tuned under low-resource settings (e.g., Llama-7b). In addition, Retroformer has an iterative policy gradient optimization step which is specifically designed to reinforce the ret- rospective model with gradient-based approach. We provide in this section a detailed description 4Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 of each of these modules and subsequently elucidate their collaborative functioning within the Retroformer framework. The implementation details are presented in Appendix C. 4.1 RETROSPECTIVE AGENT ARCHITECTURE As illustrated in Fig. 2(a), for the actor and retrospective models, we apply a standard communi- cation protocol modified from the Relexion agent architecture (Shinn et al., 2023), in which the retrospective model refines the actor prompt by appending verbal feedback to the prompt. Actor Model The actor model is a LLM hosted in the cloud, whose model parameters are hidden and frozen all the time. The actor LM is instructed to generate actions with required textual content, taking into account the observed states. Similar to reinforcement learning, we select an action or generation, denoted as at, from the current policy œÄŒ∏ at time step t and receive an observation, represented by st, from the environment. We use ReAct (Yao et al., 2023) as our actor prompt. ak,i,t = Ma \u0000 [sk,i,œÑ , ak,i,œÑ , rk,i,œÑ ]t‚àí1 œÑ=1, sk,i,t \u0001 . (3) Retrospective Model The retrospective model Mr is instantiated as a local LM. Its primary func- tion is to produce self-reflections, offering valuable feedback for diagnosing a possible reason for prior failure and devising a new, concise, high-level plan that aims to mitigate same failure. Operat- ing under a sparse reward signal, such as binary success status (success/failure), the model detects the root cause of failure by considering the current trajectory alongside its persistent memory. yk,i = Mr([sk,i,œÑ , ak,i,œÑ , rk,i,œÑ ]T œÑ=1, Gk,i| {z } Reflection prompt xk,i ). (4) This self-reflection feedback yk,i is appended to the actor prompt to prevent repetitive errors in a specific environment in future attempts. Consider a multi-step task, wherein the agent failed in the prior trial. In such a scenario, the retrospective model can detect that a particular action, denoted as at, led to subsequent erroneous actions and final failure. In future trials, the actor LM can use these self-reflections, which are appended to the prompt, to adapt its reasoning and action steps at time t, opting for the alternative action a‚Ä≤ t. This iterative process empowers the agent to exploit past experiences within a specific environment and task, thereby avoiding repetitive errors. Memory Module The actor model generates thoughts and actions, by conditioning on its recent interactions (short-term memory) and reflection responses (long-term memory) in the text prompt. ‚Ä¢ Short-term memory. The trajectory history œÑi of the current episode i serves as the short-term memory for decision making and reasoning. ‚Ä¢ Long-term memory. The self-reflection responses that summarize prior failed attempts are ap- pended to the actor prompt as the long-term memory. To facilitate policy optimization in Section 4.2, we store the instructions and responses of the ret- rospective model of each trial, together with the episode returns in a local dataset, which we call replay buffer. We sample from the replay buffer to fine-tune the retrospective model. The long and short-term memory components provide context that is specific to a given task over several failed trials and the replay buffer provides demonstrations of good and bad reflections across the tasks and environments, so that our Retroformer agent not only exploits lessons learned over failed trials in the current task, but also explores by learning from success in other related tasks. ‚Ä¢ Replay buffer. The memory DRL which stores the triplets (xk,i, yk,i, Gk,i) of the reflection in- struction prompt xk,i, reflection response yk,i and episode return Gk,i of trial i and task k. Reward Shaping Instead of exactly matching the ground truth to produce a binary reward, we use soft matching (e.g., f1 score) whenever possible to evaluate the alignment of the generated output with the expected answer or product as the reward function. The details are in Appendix C.3. 5Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 4.2 P OLICY GRADIENT OPTIMIZATION The actor model Ma is regarded as an frozen LLM, such as GPT, with inaccessible model parame- ters. In this scenario, the most direct approach to enhancing actor performance in a given environ- ment is by refining the actor LM‚Äôs prompt. Consequently, the retrospective model Mr, a smaller local language model, paraphrases the actor‚Äôs prompt by incorporating a concise summary of errors and valuable insights from failed attempts. We therefore aim to optimize the Mr model using en- vironment reward. The desired behavior of Mr is to improve the actor model Ma in next attempt. Hence, the difference in episode returns between two consecutive trials naturally serves as a reward signal for fine-tuning the retrospective model Mr with reinforcement learning.

Action 1: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Reflection prompt x Reflection response y r=0.92 r=-0.31 RatingsPPO trainer Figure 3: Policy gradient optimization of retrospective LM using RLHF training pipeline. Instruction and Response Generation The retrospective model generates a pair of instruction and response at the end of each episode i in the environment k. In the episode i, the actor produces a trajectory œÑi by interacting with the environment. The reward function then produces a score ri. At the end of the episode, to produce verbal feedback for refining the actor prompt, Mr takes the set of {œÑi, ri} as the instruction xk,i and is prompted to produce a reflection response yk,i. All these instruction-response pairs (xk,i, yk,i) across tasks and trials are stored to a local dataset DRL, which we call ‚Äúreplay buffer‚Äù, for fine-tuning the Mr. Response Rating As illustrated in Fig. 2(b), let us assume a reflection prompt xk,i and the cor- responding episode return Gk,i, and the retrospective model Mr generates the response yk,i that summarizes the mistakes in i, which results in the return Gk,i+1 in the next attempt i + 1. Because the actor is a frozen LM and the temperature is low as default (Yao et al., 2023), the injected ran- domness that leads to differences in returns ‚àÜGk,i = Gk,i+1 ‚àí Gk,i are mostly from the reflection responses yk,i, in which positive ‚àÜGk,i indicates better responses that help the actor learn from prior errors, and hence should be rated with higher scores; negative or zero ‚àÜGk,i indicates worse responses that needs to be avoided and hence should be rated with lower scores. Therefore, we approximate the rating score of a reflection instruction-response pair (xk,i, yk,i) as: r(xk,i, yk,i) ‚âú Gk,i+1 ‚àí Gk,i. (5) Proximal Policy Optimization The optimization step of Retroformer is visualized in Fig. 3. We use the differences of episode returns as the ratings of the generated reflection responses. The retrospective language model is fine-tuned with the response ratings following the RLHF training procedures (although we do not have human in the loop) with proximal policy optimization (PPO): LPPO = Ex‚àºDRL Ey‚àºLLMRL œï (x) \" rŒ∏(x, y) ‚àí Œ≤ log LLMRL œï (y|x) LLMRef(y|x) # , (6) where (x, y) are sampled from the replay buffer (note there is only 1 step in the Retrospective model‚Äôs trajactory), rŒ∏(x, y) is the defined reward model, and the second term in this objective is the KL divergence to make sure that the fine-tuned model LLMRL does not stray too far from the frozen reference model LLMRef. For offline training, we collected the dataset DRL by rolling out a base policy, i.e., the frozen actor LM and the initialized retrospective LM, in the tasks in the training sets for N trials and compute 6Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 the ratings. We apply the standard RLHF pipeline to fine-tune the retrospective model offline before evaluating the agent in the validation tasks. In online execution, we use best-of- n sampler, with the scores evaluated by the learned reward model from RLHF pipeline (Ouyang et al., 2022), for generating better retrospective responses in each trial. 5 E XPERIMENTS Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate our method, including comparisons with ReAct and Reflexion performances, and visualization and discussion of agent‚Äôs generated text and actions. 5.1 E XPERIMENT SETUP 5.1.1 E NVIRONMENT We use open-source environments: HotPotQA (Yang et al., 2018), WebShop (Yao et al., 2022) and AlfWorld (Shridhar et al., 2021) , which evaluates the agent‚Äôs reasoning and tool usage abilities for question answering reasoning, multi-step decision making, and web browsing. HotPotQA The agent is asked to solve a question answering task by searching in Wikipedia pages. At each time step, the agent is asked to choose from three action types or API calls: 1. S EARCH [ENTITY ], which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search. 2. L OOKUP [KEYWORD ], which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the last passage successfully found by Search. 3. F INISH [ANSWER ], which returns the answer and finishes the task. AlfWorld The agent is asked to perform six different tasks, including finding hidden objects (e.g., finding a spatula in a drawer), moving objects (e.g., moving a knife to the cutting board), and manip- ulating objects with other objects (e.g., chilling a tomato in the fridge) by planning with the following action APIs, including GOTO [LOCATION ], TAKE [OBJ], OPEN [OBJ], CLOSE [OBJ] , TOGGLE [OBJ], CLEAN [OBJ], HEAT [OBJ], and COOL [OBJ], etc. WebShop The agent is asked to solve a shopping task by browsing websites with detailed prod- uct descriptions and specifications. The action APIs include searching in the search bar, i.e., SEARCH [QUERY ] and clicking buttons in the web pages, i.e., C HOOSE [BUTTON ]. The clickable buttons include, product titles, options, buy, back to search, prev/next page, etc. 5.2 E XPERIMENT SETTINGS We use GPT-3 (model: text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 as the frozen actor model. For the retrospective model, we fine-tune it from LongChat (model: longchat-7b-16k). The implementation details, which include data collection and model training are in Appendix C. Evaluation Metrics We report the success rate over validation tasks in an environment. The agent is evaluated on 100 validation tasks from the distractor dev split of open-source HotPotQA dataset, 134 tasks in AlfWorld and 100 tasks in WebShop, as in (Shinn et al., 2023). Baselines We experiment with two language agent baselines: 1) ReAct (Yao et al., 2023) . This is the state-of-the-art frozen language agent architecture, which does not learn from the environ- ment rewards at all, thus serving as a baseline for showing how the agent performs without using environment feedback. 2) Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023). This is the state-of-the-art language agent architecture that the authors identify from literature so far. This agent enhances from verbal feedback of the environment, but does not use gradient signals explicitly. It can serve as a baseline for show- ing the effectiveness of gradient-based learning. 3) SAC. Furthermore, we include one online RL algorithm, i.e., Soft Actor-Critic (Haarnoja et al., 2018), or SAC as baseline model for comparison. 7Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 5.3 R ESULTS We present the experiment results in Table 2 and discuss the details below.

As shown in Table 2, we observe that our method con- sistently improve the agent performances over trials and the effects of fine-tuned retrospective model ( Retroformer) are mostly significant in the first few trials. 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 Episode ID 35 40 45 50 55Success rate (%) HotPotQA (100 distractor tasks) Retroformer (LoRA r = 1, GPT-4) Retroformer (LoRA r = 4, GPT-4) Retroformer (LoRA r = 4, GPT-3) Retroformer (LoRA r = 0, GPT-3) Reflexion (GPT-3) Reflexion (GPT-4) ReAct (GPT-3) ReAct (GPT-4) Figure 4: Retroformer shows faster and con- sistent performance improvement of success rate. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 4, our agent outperforms the two strong baselines. Specif- ically, the results indicate that our reinforced model provides the language agents with bet- ter reflection responses in early trials, which enables the agents to learn faster, while also achieving better performances in the end. Our Retroformer agent achieves 54% success rate in 4 trials, which is better than the state- of-the-art 50% success rate reported in (Jang, 2023) that uses a much larger frozen language model, i.e., GPT-3 (model: text-davinci-003) as the reflection component. The results show the effectiveness of our policy gradient approach for fine-tuning the agent with offline samples. We then examine how the retrospective model is improved with policy optimization by comparing the generated responses from the frozen LM and the ones from the fine-tuned, reinforced LM. As an example, Fig. 5 illustrates how the uninformative self-reflections from a frozen LLM, which we propose in Fig. 1, are tackled by RL. The agent failed in the last attempt because it submitted ‚ÄúTeen Tians‚Äù and ‚ÄúTeen Titans Go‚Äù as the answer to the Teen Titans spin-off series, while the correct answer includes only ‚ÄúTeen Titans Go‚Äù; The agent forgot its original goal during a chain of lengthy interactions. The self-reflection from the frozen model reiterated the prior action sequences that led to failure as the steps that the agent should have done, which prompts the agent to repeat these steps in the next attempt, resulting in an infinite loop. On the contrary, our reinforced response prompts the agent to focus on spinoff series and asks the agent to find the answer in the previous actions and observations with the search results of ‚ÄúTara Strong‚Äù. Retroformer presents better credit assignment and root cause analysis abilities, and has the power to generate actionable insights. Decision Making ‚Äì AlfWorld As showcased in Fig. 6(a), the performance improvement by Retroformer over the frozen baselines is significant and our method solves the environment 8Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 Reflection (Green: Retroformer; Brown: Frozen LM)Prior failed trialQuestion I failed to find the Teen Titans spinoff series that Tara Strong has done voice roles for.

Similar patterns are observed that the agent performs slightly better with more learnable parameters (r = 4) and that the improvements are mostly from early retries. We find that the reinforced retrospective model behaves like a summarization model of the prior failed plans and finds the differences of the prior plan with the task descriptions. With the permissible actions seen in the task instructions, this behavior effectively prevents repetitive failures and reduces search spaces. Web Browsing ‚Äì WebShop As in Fig. 6(b), the performance improvement by Retroformer over the frozen baselines is observed but the improvements may be limited, when compared with HotPotQA and AlfWorld, with 4% improvement in success rate with 4 retries. This limitation was also observed in (Shinn et al., 2023) as web browsing requires a significant amount of exploration with more precise search queries, if compared with HotPotQA. The results probably indicate that the verbal feedback approach (Reflexion, Retroformer) is not an optimal method for this environment, but our fine-tuning method still proves effective. 6 C ONCLUSION In this study, we present Retroformer, an elegant framework for iteratively improving large language agents by learning a plug-in retrospective model. This model, through the process of policy optimization, automatically refines the prompts provided to the language agent with environmental feedback. Through extensive evaluations on real-world datasets, the method has been proven to effectively improve the performances of large language agents over time both in terms of learning speed and final task completion. By considering the LLM action agent as a component of the environment, our policy gradient ap- proach allows learning from arbitrary reward signals from diverse environments and tasks. This facilitates the iterative refinement of a specific component within the language agent architecture ‚Äì the retrospective model, in our case, while circumventing the need to access the Actor LLM parame- ters or propagate gradients through it. This agnostic characteristic rendersRetroformer a concise 9Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 and adaptable plug-in module for different types of cloud-hosted LLMs, such as OpenAI GPT and Bard. Furthermore, our approach is not limited to enhancing the retrospective model alone; it can be applied to fine-tune other components within the agent system architecture, such as the memory and summarization module, or the actor prompt. By selectively focusing on the component to be fine- tuned while keeping the remainder fixed, our proposed policy gradient approach allows for iterative improvements of the component with reward signals obtained from the environment.

Counting to explore and generalize in text- based games. arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.11525, 2018. 11Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 Appendix for ‚ÄúRetroformer: Retrospective Large Language Agents with Policy Gradi- ent Optimization‚Äù A C HALLENGES Although LLMs are not designed to handle tool use or take actions, it has been observed (Gravitas, 2023; Nakajima, 2023; Chase, 2023) that empirically for text-rich environment, especially when the actions and states are accurately described using natural languages, LLMs work surprisingly well. However there are still plenty of challenges applying LLM-based agents. Here we list several below. Spurious Actions LLMs are not pre-trained or designed with an action-agent application in mind. Even some restrictions are explicitly specified in the prompt, the LLM model may still generate spurious actions that are not in the action space A. Limited Prompt Length LLM itself is stateless. However, in applications it is preferred to em- power agents with states or memories for better performance. It has been observed that LLM based agents are easy to run into infinite loops if the states are not handled nicely. Many LLM agents concatenate all the previous state descriptions and actions into the prompt so that LLM as a way to bestow ‚Äùstate‚Äù to the LLM. Inevitably this methodology runs into the prompt length issues. As the trajectory grows longer, the prompt runs out of spaces. Heuristic Prompt Engineering Even though a lot of paradigms have been proposed to improve LLM agents‚Äô performance (Yao et al., 2023; Ahn et al., 2022), there is a lack of systematic method- ologies for consistent model refinement. In fact, manual prompt tuning is still widely used in a lot of the application scenarios. Prohibitive Training Most of the well-performing LLMs are too large to be fit in just one or two GPUs. It is technically challenging to optimize the LLMs directly as is done in the the classical reinforcement learning setting. In particular, OpenAI has not provided any solution for RL based finetuning. Most of the issues are caused by the fact that LLMs are not pre-trained or designed with an action-agent application in mind. B I NTUITION Compared to the LLM-based action agents, classical RL agents, though not able to handle text-based environments as nicely in the zero shot setting, are able to keep improving based on the feedback and rewards provided by the environment. Popular RL algorithms include Policy Gradient (Sutton et al., 2000), Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithm (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017), Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) (Schulman et al., 2015), and Advantage Actor Critic methods (Mnih et al., 2016). In this draft we are proposing a simple but powerful novel framework to tackle the challenges men- tioned above. On one hand, we would like to leverage the classical RL based optimization algorithms such as policy gradient to improve the model performance. On the other hand, our framework avoids finetuning on the LLM directly. The key is, instead of training the LLM directly, we train a retro- spective LM. The retrospective LM takes users‚Äô prompt, rewards and feedback from the environment as input. Its output will be prompt for the actual LLM to be consumed. RL algorithms are employed to optimize the weights in the retrospective LM model instead of directly on the LLM. In our frame- work the weights in the actual LLM is assumed to be fixed (untrainable), which aligns well with the application scenario when the LLM is either too large to tune or prohibited from any tuning. Another perspective viewing our framework is, we train a retrospective LM to apply automatic prompt tuning for the LLM agents. In this case, the RL algorithms such as policy gradients are employed to optimize the prompts. Ideally the retrospective LM can help summarize the past ‚Äúex- perience‚Äù, the users‚Äô prompt, the environments‚Äô feedback into a condensed text with length limit 12Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 so that it is easier for the LLM to digest. To some extent, in our setting the original LLM can be considered as part of the environment since its parameters are all fixed. C I MPLEMENTATION DETAILS C.1 R ETROFORMER Model We use GPT-3 (model: text-davinci-003) as the frozen actor model. For the retrospective model, we instantiate it from LongChat (model: longchat-7b-16k), which is a LM with 16k context length by fine-tuning llama-7b on instruction-following samples from ShareGPT. In all experiments, we set the temperature of actor LM as zero, i.e., T=0 and top p =1 to isolate the randomness of LM from the effects of reflections. We acknowledge that setting a higher temperature value can encourage exploration but it can obscure the impact of the proposed approaches, making it difficult to compare against existing baselines with T=0 (Yao et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2023). Setup Our proposed learning framework is developed by using multiple open-source tools as fol- lows. We use the OpenAI connectors from langchain to build our actor models Ma. During in- ference of the retrospective model, we host an API server using FastChat and integrates it with langchain agents. The tool can host longchat-7b-16k with concurrent requests to speed up RL pol- icy rollouts. For fine-tuning the retrospective model, we develop our training pipeline withtrl, which supports transformer reinforcement learning with PPO trainer. We present the details of the specific prompts we used and the full agent demonstrations and exam- ples for each environment in Appendix E. Data Collection For HotPotQA environment, We collected 3,383 reflection samples by running the base rollout policy for 3 trials ( N = 3 ) for 3,000 tasks in the training set, in which 1,084 instruction-response pairs have positive ratings. For AlfWorld, we collected 523 reflection samples and for WebShop, we collected 267 reflection samples. Training We fine-tune the retrospective model Mr with 4-bit quantized LoRA adapters (r=1 or r=4) on the offline RL datasets with epochs=4; batch size=8; lr=1.4e-5. The number of trainable parameters is 0.53M (0.015% of llama-7b) or 2.25M. Since longchat-16k is based on Llama, we used the default llama recipes for finetuning. Specifically, we first run supervised fine-tuning trainer on the samples with positive ratings for 2 epochs and then the RLHF pipeline, including reward modeling, and RL fine-tuning with PPO, on the whole offline rating dataset using the default settings for llama-7b model. We list the key hyperparameters here: ‚Ä¢ Supervised Finetuning: learning rate=1e-5, batch size=32, max steps=5,000 ‚Ä¢ Reward Modeling: learning rate=2.5e-5, batch size=32, max steps=20,000 ‚Ä¢ Policy Gradient Finetuning: learning rate=1.4e-5, max steps=20,000, output max length=128, batch size=64, gradient accumulation steps=8, ppo epochs=4 Reproducibility All experiments are done in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) GKE environment with A100 40GB GPUs. The code can be found in https://anonymous.4open.science/ r/Retroformer-F107. We plan to open source the code repository after the review period. Algorithm The offline PPO algorithm we used for finetuning the Retrospective component in this paper is presented below in Algorithm 1. It contains three steps: offline data collection, reward model learning, and policy gradient finetuning. We use the offline ratings data to train a reward model first, and plug in the reward model for PPO finetuning. 13Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 Algorithm 1 Retroformer with Policy Gradient Optimization 1: Initialize TEXT -DAVINCI -003 as the Retrospective model with LONGCHAT -16 K.

C.2 B ASELINE : S OFT-ACTOR CRITIC AGENT Traditional reinforcement learning methods have been recognized to perform well within the same framework of interaction-feedback-learning. We include one online RL algorithm, i.e., Soft Actor- Critic (Haarnoja et al., 2018), or SAC as baseline model for comparison. Given that the three environments are text-based games, inspired by (Yuan et al., 2018), we do mean-pooling for the embeddings of the generated text outputs, such as ‚ÄúSearch[It Takes a Family]‚Äù as the agent actions. Therefore, the action space is continuous and is of 768 dimension. We apply LoRA adapters with r = 4 on the agent Action model instantiated from longchat-16k, and use SAC to do the online updates, with discount factor gamma=0.99, interpolation factor polyak=0.995, learning rate=0.01, entropy regularzation alpha=0.2, and batch size=8. C.3 R EWARD FUNCTION HotPotQA F1 reward is used in the HotPotQA environment for comparing the matching of a generated answer to a question against the ground truth answer. After removing the stopwords in both answers, we calculate the number of common tokens in two answers. Then Precision is # of common tokens divided by # of generated answer tokens and the Recall is # common tokens divided by # ground truth answer tokens. We can then compute f1 from precision and recall. AlfWorld The binary success (1) and failure of the tasks at the end of episode is used as the reward. WebShop In each episode, the agent receives a reward r = R(sT , a) in the end at timestep T, where a = choose[buy], y is the product chosen by the agent in the final state sT , and Yatt and Yopt are its corresponding attributes and options. The reward is defined as: r = rtype ¬∑ |Uatt ‚à© Yatt| + |Uopt ‚à© Yopt| + 1[yprice ‚â§ uprice] |Uatt| + |Uopt| + 1 (7) where the type reward rtype = TextMatch(¬Øy, ¬Øy‚àó) is based on text matching heuristics to assign low reward when y and y‚àó have similar attributes and options but are obviously different types of products. For example, ‚Äúbutter‚Äù and ‚Äúplant-based meat‚Äù differ in types but may both contain attributes ‚Äúcruelty-free‚Äù, ‚Äúnon-GMO‚Äù, and an option ‚Äúsize: pack of 2‚Äù. 14Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 D A DDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS Reinforced modelresponseFrozen modelresponse I think the issue might have been with the search. I was not able to find the name \"Miller\" in the paragraph, which is why I was not able to find James Henry Miller's wife. I should have searched for \"Miller's wife\" instead of \"James Henry Miller's wife\" to avoid this confusion.New Plan:To avoid confusion, I will search for \"Miller's wife\" instead of \"James Henry Miller's wife\" and directly look for the nationality of the wife. I got stuck in a loop where I kept searching for the same person, Henry Miller, instead of Beatrice Sylvas Wickens. It's possible that I may have misheard or misunderstood the question. To avoid this, I should have written down the question and made sure I understood it correctly before beginning the search. Additionally, I should have tried searching for \"James Henry Miller's wife\" instead of just \"James Henry Miller\". Figure 7: Response refinement from the reinforced retrospective model with structured format. Structured Reflections and Action Plans. We discover one emergent behavior of the reinforced model that it can automatically paraphrase the original responses into two separate structured sec- tions, namely Reflection section and New plan: section, although not being explicitly trained or prompted for. One such example is shown in Fig. 7. The paraphrased response retrospects in the first paragraph and provides actionable insights next, while the response from the frozen LM in- terleaved both parts in one paragraph, making it hard to comprehend. We can also observer from Fig. 5 that the reinforced response removes the messy, irrelevant ‚ÄúNext trial:‚Äù content in the end for cleaner format, which may very likely result from LLM hallucination.

Our approach\nleverages this proxy reward function in an RL framework. Specifically, users\nspecify a prompt once at the beginning of training. During training, the LLM\nevaluates an RL agent's behavior against the desired behavior described by the\nprompt and outputs a corresponding reward signal. The RL agent then uses this\nreward to update its behavior.

Can we instead cheaply design rewards using a natural language inter- face? This paper explores how to simplify reward design by prompting a large language model (LLM) such as GPT-3 as a proxy reward function, where the user provides a tex- tual prompt containing afew examples(few-shot) or adescription(zero-shot) of the de- sired behavior. Our approach leverages this proxy reward function in an RL framework. Specifically, users specify a prompt once at the beginning of training. During training, the LLM evaluates an RL agent‚Äôs behavior against the desired behavior described by the prompt and outputs a corresponding reward signal. The RL agent then uses this reward to update its behavior. We evaluate whether our approach can train agents aligned with user objectives in the Ultimatum Game, matrix games, and theDEALORNODEAL negotiation task. In all three tasks, we show that RL agents trained with our framework are well-aligned with the user‚Äôs objectives and outperform RL agents trained with reward functions learned via supervised learning. Code and prompts can be found here. 1 I NTRODUCTION Autonomous agents are becoming increasingly capable with the rise of compute and data. This underscores the importance for human users to be able to control what policies the agents learn and ensure the policies are aligned with their objectives. For instance, imagine training an agent to represent users in a salary negotiation. A working mother fighting for a livable wage may want their agent to be stubborn whereas a new hire looking to develop a good relationship with the company may want their agent to be more versatile. Currently, users specify desired behaviors by 1) designing reward functions or 2) providing large amounts of labeled data. Both approaches are challenging and impractical for different reasons. Designing reward func- tions is not an intuitive way to specify preferences. For instance, it isn‚Äôt straightforward how to write a reward function for a ‚Äúversatile‚Äù negotiator. Furthermore, designing reward functions that balance between different objectives ‚Äî also known as the ‚Äúreward design problem‚Äù ‚Äî is notoriously difficult because agents are sus- ceptible to reward hacking (Amodei et al., 2016; Hadfield-Menell et al., 2017). On the other hand, one can learn a reward function from labeled examples. However, that is not possible with a single example; we need large amounts of labeled data to capture the nuances of different users‚Äô preferences and objectives, which has shown to be costly (Zhang et al., 2016). Additionally, both approaches do not generalize well to new users who have different objectives ‚Äî we would have to re-design our reward functions or re-collect data. Our aim is to create an easier way for users to communicate their preferences, where the interface is more intuitive than crafting a reward function and where they can cheaply specify their preferences with no more than a few examples. To do this, we leverage large language models (LLMs) that are trained on internet-scale text data and have shown an impressive ability to learn in-context from few or zero examples (Brown et al., 2020). Our key insight is that The scale of data that LLMs have been trained on make them great in-context learners and also allows them to capture meaningful commonsense priors about human behavior. Given a few examples or a description demonstrating the user‚Äôs objective, an LLM should be able to provide an accurate instantiation of reward values on a new test example, allowing for easier generalization to new objectives. To this end, we explore how to prompt an LLM as a proxy reward function to train RL agents from user inputs. In our approach, the user specifies an objective with a natural language prompt.

Figure 1: Depiction of our framework on theDEALORNODEAL negotiation task. A user provides an example and explanation of desired negotiating behavior (e.g., versatility) before training. During training, (1) we provide the LLM with a task description, a user‚Äôs description of their objective, an outcome of an episode that is converted to a string, and a question asking if the outcome episode satisfies the user objective. (2-3) We then parse the LLM‚Äôs response back into a string and use that as the reward signal for theAlice the RL agent. (4)Alice updates their weights and rolls out a new episode.

During evaluation, we sample a trajectory fromAliceand evaluate whether it is aligned with the user‚Äôs objective. be specified with a few examples when they are difficult to define (such as ‚Äúversatility‚Äù) or as a single phrase when they are well-known concepts (such as ‚ÄúPareto-optimality‚Äù). We use the prompt and the LLM to define a reward function for training an RL agent. The LLM takes the user prompt and a trajectory from an RL episode as input and outputs a score (e.g., ‚ÄúNo‚Äù or ‚Äú0‚Äù) for whether the trajectory satisfies the user‚Äôs objective, which we parse as an integer reward for the RL agent (Figure 1). There are two advantages to prompting LLMs as a proxy reward function: (1) we can leverage LLM‚Äôs in-context learning abilities and prior knowledge on human behavior so that users only need to provide a handful of example desirable behaviors and (2) users can specify their preferences intuitively using language. On the other hand, a potential disadvantage is that it is unclear how much prompt design will be required for the LLM to reliably infer user intent (see Sec. 5 for a discussion). The goal of this paper is to explore how well LLMs can train objective-aligned agents by providing reward signals, and empirically examine whether we can do so with no more than a few examples. Our contributions are as follows: ‚Ä¢ We introduce the idea of using LLMs as a proxy reward function. ‚Ä¢ We propose a general RL training framework that leverages this proxy reward and is agnostic to the RL algorithm used. ‚Ä¢ We show that an LLM can more accurately train objective-aligned RL agents by an average of35% compared the baseline. We use few-shot prompting for theUltimatum Gameand DEALORNODEAL negotiation task as well as zero-shot prompting inMatrix Games. ‚Ä¢ We conduct a pilot study with10 human users. Users rate our agent to be significantly more aligned with their objective than an agent trained with a different one,p< 0.001. ‚Ä¢ We provide further analysis quantifying the amount of user data required for our approach as well as the effect varying prompts has on the LLM‚Äôs reward signal accuracy. 2 R ELATED WORK Using Language for Reward Shaping. Recent Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) works Ouyang et al. (2022); Bai et al. (2022) use LLMs as rewards by fine-tuning them on large amounts of user data. Our work does not fine-tune LLMs but uses in-context learning from only a handful of user data. 2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Several works Goyal et al. (2019); Carta et al. (2022); Mirchandani et al. (2021) shape rewards by training an RL agent to learn and complete intermediate tasks guided by language. In contrast, our framework does not focus on generating subtasks but leverages the in-context learning abilities of an LLM to determine whether an agent‚Äôs policy satisfies the higher-level task. RL and Foundation Models. We leverage large language models such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to learn a proxy reward function while avoiding the need for many expert demonstrations. Ahn et al. (2022); Huang et al. (2022) use an LLM to provide a plan which guides a robot with reasonable/feasible actions towards a human goal (e.g., with enumerating subtasks). In contrast, our work is different in that we are using an LLM to identify if a behavior satisfies ‚Äúhard-to-specify‚Äù properties of a human‚Äôs objective and also offers users more control over how they want their policy to be executed. In the vision domain, Parisi et al. (2022) used pre-trained vision models as a feature extractor for the learned policy, but not to design a reward signal. In a similar spirit of leveraging self-supervised pre-training to design a flexible reward function, Chen et al. (2021) use a broad dataset of human videos and a small dataset of robot videos to train a reward function, which improves generalization to new environments and tasks. The interface for the desired task is a video of the task to be completed, instead of text in our framework, and the domain is restricted to robot tasks. More related works can be found in Sec. A.2. 3 U SING LLMS AS AREWARD SIGNAL Our goal is to use an LLM as a proxy reward function to train objective-aligned RL agents from user inputs. We formalize the task using a Markov Decision ProcessM=‚ü®S,A,p,R,Œ≥‚ü©, whereS is the state space (e.g., in DEALORNODEAL, the space of representations of utterances in the negotiation so far),A is the action space (e.g., set of all possible utterances),p:S√óA√óS ‚Üí[0,1] is the transition probability, andŒ≥ is the discount factor. Traditionally the reward function maps states and actions to a real numberR:S√óA‚Üí R. In our work, we use an LLM as a proxy reward function that takes in a text prompt and outputs a string. We defineA‚àó to be the set of all strings,œÅ‚ààA‚àó as our text prompt (input to the LLM) and the LLM as a function LLM :A‚àó‚ÜíA‚àó. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the promptœÅ is a concatenation of four components including a string to describe the taskœÅ1 ‚ààA‚àó and a user-specified string that describes their objectives using examples or a description,œÅ2 ‚ààA‚àó. Additionally, we include a textual description of states and actions from an RL episode,œÅ3, using a parserf :S√óA‚Üí A‚àó. œÅ3 can describe the final state, final action, a trajectory, or any other representation of the episode. Finally, we include a questionœÅ4 ‚ààA‚àó that asks whether the RL agent‚Äôs behavior,œÅ3, satisfies the user‚Äôs objective,œÅ2. We define an additional parserg :A‚àó ‚Üí{0,1} that maps the textual output ofLLM to a binary value. We use this as the reward signal. Our framework replaces the traditional reward function with a proxy reward,LLM, and can be used with any RL training algorithm. Our framework is depicted in Fig. 1. Before training, a user specifiesœÅ2 which can beN examples describing their objective or a description of their objective using natural language. In Fig. 1 a user provides an example of their objective: versatile negotiating behavior. During training, we construct a promptœÅ by concatenating a description of the task, the user-specified examples/description, an episode‚Äôs outcome, and a question asking if the outcome satisfies the objective. We (1) feed the prompt to the LLM, (2) take its output, and (3) parse it into an integer using functiong; we use a handcrafted, task-specific parser. We use the integer as the reward signal. (4) The RL agent then updates its weights and rolls out an episode. (5) We parse the episode outcome into a string usingf and continue training; we also instantiatef as handcrafted, task-specific parser. To evaluate our framework, we sample a trajectory (e.g., a negotiation) from the agent and evaluate whether the trajectory is aligned with the user‚Äôs objective (e.g., whetherAlice demonstrated versatile negotiating behavior). 4 E XPERIMENTS In this section we investigate three questions to determine the feasibility and efficacy of our approach: (Q1) Can LLMs produce reward signals that are consistent with user objectives from a few examples (few-shot prompting)? (Q2) When objectives are well-known, can LLMs produce objective-consistent reward signals withoutany examples (zero-shot prompting)? (Q3) Can LLMs provide objective-aligned reward signals from examples (few-shot prompting) in more complex, longer-horizon domains? We evaluate our approach on three tasks: theUltimatum Game, 2-playerMatrix Games, and theDEALORNODEAL negotiation task (Lewis et al., 2017). We address (Q1) using theUltimatum Game. We useMatrix Games to address (Q2) because it has well-known solution concepts such as Pareto-optimality. The 3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 DEALORNODEAL negotiation task is a longer-horizon domain where the LLM rewards agents for negotiating in a user-specified style; we address (Q3) in this task. In practice, we do not have access to ground truth user reward functions ‚Äî this is the function that we are trying to approximate. However, for most of our experiments, we assume access to the true reward by constructing user reward functions that humans have been shown to have inspired by prior work.We use the true rewards only to evaluate our framework‚Äôs performance.Finally, we include a pilot user study where we evaluate agent performance when we do not have access to the ground truth reward. We use the ‚Äòtext-davinci-002‚Äô GPT-3 model with temperature0 as our LLM and our results are reported across 3 random seeds. Details on how we trained RL agents for each task are in A.4. s Evaluation Metrics. We evaluate our approach using the following metrics across our tasks (task-specific metrics are described within each subsection): Labeling Accuracy. We construct ground-truth reward functions for each domain. We report the mean accuracy of predictions of the reward valueduring RL trainingwith respect to the ground-truth reward functions. This assesses how effectively the LLM can produce reward signals that are consistent with the user‚Äôs objective. RL Agent Accuracy. After RL training, we evaluate the learned policy with respect to the ground truth reward functions. We report the mean accuracy of RL agents. Baselines. SL (Few-shot baseline). A supervised learning (SL) model trained to predict reward signals using the same examples given to the LLM in our framework. Examples are represented using structured non-text inputs, making it an easier problem for the SL model. This baseline only applies to tasks where we use few-shot prompting (Ultimatum Game, DEALORNODEAL). See A.5 for details on training and model architecture for each task. No Objective (Zero-shot baseline). In our zero-shot task,Matrix Games, we do not use any examples so we do not use SL as a baseline. Instead, we use aNo Objectivebaseline where we prompt the LLM without using the user‚Äôs description of their objective to isolate the effect the description has on the LLM‚Äôs response. RL trained with Ground Truth Reward Functions. RL agents trained with ground truth reward functions. We use this as an oracle. 4.1 U LTIMATUM GAME: TRAINING OBJECTIVE -ALIGNED AGENTS WITH FEW-SHOT PROMPTING When defining a precise objective is difficult, we can instead give a few examples of desired behavior. For instance, in a resource division game like theUltimatum Game, it may be difficult for a user to specify the exact percentage (such as32.4%) of resources they would be happy with receiving. Instead it could be easier for a user to give examples of splits that they would be happy with. We explore whether LLMs can produce reward signals that are consistent with user objectives from a few examples in theUltimatum Game. Task Description. TheUltimatum Gameconsists of two players, a Proposer and a Responder. A sum of money is endowed to the Proposer and they must propose a way to split the endowment with the Responder. The Responder can accept or reject the proposed split. If the Responder accepts, players receive money as per the split; if the Responder rejects, then both players get nothing. We train an RL agent to play the Responder. The agent learns to reject proposals according to a user‚Äôs preferences. The game consists of a single timestep and our RL agents are trained using DQN for1e4 steps. Ground Truth User Objectives. A rational Responder would accept any proposal, even if it is unfair because getting something is better than getting nothing (in fact, this is a Nash Equilibrium of the game). However, prior work in behavioral economics shows that humans are willing to ‚Äúpunish‚Äù the Proposer by rejecting unfair proposals (V avra et al., 2018). For instance, a student may reject an unfair proposal only if she receives less than 30% of the endowment whereas a wealthier person may reject if they receive less than 60%. We experiment with the following preferences: ‚Ä¢ Low vs High Percentages.Users will reject proposals if they receive less than{30%, 60%} of the endowment. ‚Ä¢ Low vs High Payoffs.Users will reject unfair proposals if they receive less than{$10, $100}. They accept unfair proposals otherwise. 4Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 UltimatumLow vs High %Low vs High PayoffsLabeling Accuracy(10 examples, ours w/o expl.)

Prompt Design. We describe a user‚Äôs objective using10 examples of theUltimatum Game. An example consists of the proposed split, the Responder‚Äôs action, and a ‚Äúyes/no‚Äù label of whether the Responder‚Äôs action was desirable or undesirable. These examples do not have explanations and resemble a traditional dataset used for supervised learning. We also experiment with using a single example followed by a short explanation. Importantly, we do not explicitly mention the user‚Äôs ground truth objective in the prompt. See Fig. 10 in the Appendix for an example of both types of prompts. Design Procedure.We randomly generated10 proposed splits used for our prompt and sampled one proposal from the set for our single-example case. ForLow vs High Percentagesand Low vs High Payoffs, we used the same set of proposals across variants (i.e., same proposals for (30% and 60%) and ($10, $100)). We also randomly generated50 proposals used to evaluate the LLM. Due to limited resources when querying GPT-3, we query the model‚Äôs responses to the50 evaluation splits in a batched manner and save them. We then use those responses as the reward signal. 4.1.1 R ESULTS Labeling Accuracy. We evaluated our approach on our test set of50 proposals over3 seeds; results are shown in Fig. 21. When prompted with10 examples without explanations, the LLM and SL perform similarly well (see Fig. 2, top row). This result is not surprising, given that the decision boundary for the binary decision tasks is relatively simple to learn with10 training examples. Instead, if we prompt the LLM with a single example followed by an explanation, it maintains a high accuracy whereas SL trained on the same, single example drops in accuracy. We did not use the explanation as part of input when training SL because it only takes non-textual inputs. This result highlights the advantage of using an LLM over a supervised learning model: they require far fewer examples because they can learn fromexplanations(Lampinen et al., 2022). We find that explanations are critical, as removing explanations when prompting the LLM with a single example results in a drop in LLM labeling accuracy (avg. drop of31.67%) and a drop in RL agent accuracy (avg. drop of28.8%). RL Agent Accuracy. The accuracy of the trained RL agents mirror the labeling accuracy. Summary. LLMs are efficient in-context learners. They are able to provide reward signals that are consistent with a user‚Äôs objectives from examples ‚Äî even a single example with an explanation will suffice. 4.2 M ATRIX GAMES: TRAINING OBJECTIVE -ALIGNED AGENTS WITH ZERO-SHOT PROMPTING When objectives are well-known concepts such as Pareto-optimality, can we prompt the LLM without giving any examples? We hypothesize that well-known objectives are likely to be in-distribution for LLMs, and thus LLMs may be able to produce objective-aligned reward signals from zero-shot prompting. Since 1We do not display plots forInequity Aversionbecause both LLM and SL received perfect labeling and RL agent accuracy. 5Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 MatrixLabelingAccuracy RL Agent Accuracy (Regular Order) Figure 3:Matrix Games, Zero-shot. (Top) Accuracy of reward signals provided by LLM and aNo Objective baseline during RL training. We report results for both regular and scrambled versions of matrix games. (Bottom) Accuracy of RL agents after training. we do not use examples, we do not use a SL baseline. Instead we use a baselineNo Objectivewhere we do not mention any objectives and ask the LLM for a reward signal (see example in Fig. 11 in the Appendix). This baseline evaluates whether the LLM can successfully apply its knowledge of each objective. Task Description. We consider two-player normal-form matrix games: Battle of the Sexes, Stag Hunt, Chicken, and Prisoner‚Äôs Dilemma. Each matrix game has four joint outcomes (i.e., a tuple of joint actions and rewards) and we address pure strategies in this task. The game consists of a single timestep and our RL agents are trained using DQN for500 steps. Ground Truth User Objectives. Although (mixed) Nash Equilibria are traditional solution concepts for normal form matrix games, users may prefer a solution for other properties. For instance, in Prisoner‚Äôs Dilemma, users may prefer both agents to cooperate because they will maximize total welfare even though it is not a Pure Nash Equilibrium. We experiment with four well-known solution concepts (or objectives): ‚Ä¢ Total Welfare.Outcomes that achieve the greatest sum of player rewards. ‚Ä¢ Equality.Outcomes that result in equal rewards between players. ‚Ä¢ Rawlsian Fairness.Outcomes that maximize the minimum reward any player receives. ‚Ä¢ Pareto-optimality.Outcomes where the one of the corresponding rewards cannot be improved without lowering the other. Prompt Design. Prompts for each solution concept are shown in Fig. 11 in the Appendix. Due to limited resources with querying GPT-3, we queried GPT-3 in a batched manner and saved the corresponding labels to train our RL agents. Our prompt enumerates the outcomes of a matrix game and then asks the LLM for the outcome(s) that satisfy a solution concept. We do not mention the name of the matrix game in the prompt. As in Kojima et al. (2022), we elicit intermediate reasoning steps by asking the LLM to ‚Äúthink step-by-step‚Äù and provide a definition of the solution concept. To prevent any bias the LLM may have towards the order in which the outcomes of a matrix game are presented, we also randomly scramble associations between joint actions and rewards (example shown in Fig. 12 in the Appendix). Design Procedure.We tuned the wording of our prompt (e.g., how to describe the matrix game, whether or not to use chain-of-thought prompting) on the Battle of the Sexes matrix game to find a prompt that gave us accurate results. During evaluation, we kept the structure of our prompt the same for all of the matrix games. 4.2.1 R ESULTS Labeling Accuracy. Given that each game can have many outcomes that satisfy a solution concept, we report the LLM‚Äôs accuracy if its response does not include any incorrect outcomes. If the LLM identifies any incorrect outcome, we report a score of0. The LLM produces more objective-aligned reward signals with zero-shot prompting by applying its knowledge of well-known objectives, improving the labeling accuracy over having no objective by 48% on average with a regular ordering of matrix game outcomes and 36% with a scrambled order. Scrambling the order of matrix game outcomes in the prompt lowers accuracy for most solution concepts. We suspect that this is because the matrix games are well-known and likely to have been in the LLM‚Äôs training set, where each joint action is usually associated with particular 6Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 payoffs. Scrambling the associations between joint actions and payoffs could make the matrix game more out-of-distribution for the LLM, and thus lower accuracy. RL Agent Accuracy. Compared to labeling accuracy, it is easier for the resulting RL agents to be accurate because they only need to learnone correct outcome, not all of them. Thus, LLMs that only identify one out of two correct outcomes can still train objective-aligned RL agents. Results are shown on the bottom row of Fig. 3. RL agents trained using rewards from the LLM receive perfect accuracy forTotal Welfareand Equal- ity and 75% accuracy for the other two objectives. The baseline receives lower accuracy for all objectives. Does the LLM Correctly Identify Each Objective?As part of our prompt, we ask the LLM to provide a definition of the objective before reasoning about whether an outcome satisfies the objective (see Fig. 11 in the Appendix). Table 2 in the Appendix shows how the LLM defines each objective zero-shot. The LLM is able to successfully recall the definitions for each objective except forRawlsian Fairness‚Äì it gets it partially correct. However, the LLM varies in its ability to reason whether an outcome of a game satisfies the objective, which explains why the LLM does not receive perfect labeling accuracy for all objectives. Summary. An LLM is able to identify well-known objectives and provide objective-aligned reward signals in a zero-shot setting. 4.3 D EALORNODEAL: TRAINING OBJECTIVE -ALIGNED AGENTS IN MULTI-TIMESTEP TASKS We have shown that an LLM can provide objective-aligned reward signals in single-timestep tasks. In longer horizon tasks we must give trajectories instead of states as examples in our prompts. Longer prompts can be challenging because it is less likely for an LLM to have seen them during training. LLMs also have a recency bias which makes it harder for them to remember context introduced earlier on (Zhao et al., 2021). Can an LLM provide objective-aligned signals in longer horizon tasks? We investigate this question in the DEALORNODEAL negotiation task (Lewis et al., 2017). Task Description. DEALORNODEAL is a long-horizon task with a maximum length of100 timesteps. An agentAlicemust come to an agreement with her partnerBob on the allocation of a set of objects (books, hats, andballs). Agents are shown a context, which includes the counts of each item and their private utilities for each item. In the original task, agents get rewarded based on the agreed upon split and their utilities. IfAliceand Bob reach a disagreement, both agents get nothing. We trainAliceusing on-policy RL by negotiating against a fixed partner model, which we refer to asBob. See Sec. A.4 for more details on the domain and training. Ground Truth User Objectives. We trainAliceto negotiate in differentstyles. For this experiment, we assume we have access to precise definitions in order to evaluate our models. Importantly, we do not give definitions of each style to the LLM, only examples. We experiment with the following negotiation styles inspired by previous literature Sycara et al. (1997); Caputo et al. (2019): ‚Ä¢ Versatile.Alicedoes not suggest the same proposal more than once. ‚Ä¢ Push-Over.Alicegets less points thanBob. ‚Ä¢ Competitive.Alicegets more points thanBob. ‚Ä¢ Stubborn.Alicerepeatedly suggests the same proposal. Prompt Design. We describe user objectives using three examples. Each example contains a negotiation betweenAliceand Bob, a question asking whetherAlicenegotiated in a particular style, and a yes or no answer followed by a short explanation. For an example, see Fig. 13 in the Appendix. Design Procedure.To create example negotiations, we randomly sampled three negotiation contexts for each objective and trained an RL agent (using the original task reward, without the LLM) to negotiate againstBob in these contexts. We then sampled negotiations from the trained model. We also made sure all three sampled negotiations did not have the same ground truth label. We use a separate set of contexts when training RL agents with an LLM in the loop. 4.3.1 R ESULTS Labeling Accuracy. The top row of Fig. 4 shows that the LLM labels more accurately than SL except for V ersatile. ForV ersatile, both models perform similarly because SL learns to overwhelmingly predict a negative label (avg of96% negative predictions) and the RL agent showed more negative examples of V ersatilebehavior (avg. of70% ground truth negative labels).

RL Agent Accuracy. Results are shown on bottom row of of Fig. 4. LLM improves RL agent accuracy over SL by46% on average. Our method approaches the performance of using the true reward; we under perform by an average of4%. We remind readers that itis possible to outperform an agent trained with the true reward ‚Äî especially when the LLM‚Äôs labeling accuracy is near-perfect as is the case forCompetitiveand Stubborn‚Äî due to reward hacking or stochasticity during training. For instance, agents trained with the true reward forCompetitiveend in more disagreements, leading to0 reward for both agents and a lower accuracy. Is There a Qualitative Difference in Styles?Example negotiations of agents trained with the LLM for each style are shown in Fig. 9 in the Appendix. To measure qualitative differences among styles, we looked at average advantage (Alice‚Äôs original task reward - Bob‚Äôs original task reward), diversity (percentage of Alice‚Äôs utterances that are unique in a negotiation), and agreement rate (percentage of negotiations that end in agreement). The results in Table 1 demonstrate qualitative differences in styles. 4.3.2 P ILOT USER STUDY We conduct a within-subjects pilot user study to determine whether our trained agents can meaningfully align themselves with different user objectiveswhen we do not have access to ground truth objectives and users evaluate agent performance. MethodWe askedN =10 users to select a style in which they wanted their agent to negotiate in. We gave them an option to choose from our existing styles (V ersatile, Push-Over, Competitive, Stubborn), or come up with their own. Importantly, users did not know how we defined these styles. We then showed users a list of10 example negotiations generated via selfplay using an RL agent trained with a greedy objective (no particular style). We asked users to select3 examples (1 positive,1 negative, and1 positive or negative) where Alice displayed positive or negative behavior of the user‚Äôs chosen style. For each chosen example, we asked users whetherAlice demonstrated their chosen style and asked them to provide a ‚ÄùY es/No‚Äù answer as well as a short explanation. These examples corresponded to unknown, user-specific ground truth reward functions that we did not have access to. We then trained a negotiation agent by incorporating the user-provided examples in the prompt as described in Sec. 3. We also trained an agent to negotiate in the opposite style by flipping the ‚ÄùY es/No‚Äù labels in the user-provided explanations. We hypothesize that users should perceive a significant difference between these two agents. To evaluate our trained agents, we had both agents negotiate on a set of10 test negotiations. For each test negotiation, we asked users to rate how well each agent aligned with their chosen style on a scale from1 (least aligned) to5 (most aligned). ResultsAgents trained with the correct style were significantly more aligned (avg.3.72¬±1.2) than agents trained with the opposite style (avg.1.56¬±1.05), p <0.001, see Fig. 4 (right). Users varied in which 8Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 styles they preferred:4 users chose styles such asPolite, Push-Over, Considerateand Compromising, 2 users choseV ersatile, and4 users chose styles such asStubborn, Competitiveand Ambitious. These results demonstrate that our framework can produce agents aligned with differently specified objectives by changing the examples in the prompt. Furthermore, these results suggest that our framework can be used when rewards are difficult to define and results are agents with humans. Summary. Our framework can train objective-aligned agents when ground truth rewards are not present in complex, longer-horizon tasks. Agents are able to align the style in which they complete a task as evaluated by automated metrics as well as human users. 5 A NALYSIS OF DATA EFFICIENCY & PROMPT DESIGN We have shown that we can use an LLM as a proxy reward function to successfully train objective-aligned agents across different tasks. This is a promising result because it represents an important step in enabling human-compatible and value-aligned AI systems. In this section, 1) we further quantify how data efficient our method is and 2) also analyze how robust LLM is to variations of prompt design. 1) How Data-efficient is Our Method?We quantify how muchmore user data a supervised learning baseline would need in order to achieve the same labeling accuracy as the LLM. Results in theUltimatum Game demonstrate that10 labeled examples is enough for an SL model to reach comparable performance, whereas a a single labeled example is not sufficient. In this section, we quantify the amount of data needed for DEALORNODEAL because it is an example of a task where the decision boundary is not as easy to learn as theUltimatum Game. We train SL by adding additional class-balanced, labeled examples to the original three examples it was trained on. We plot the average labeling accuracy SL achieves when trained on increasingly larger amounts of examples as well as the accuracy LLM achieves with three examples, shown in Fig. 6 in the Appendix.Results show that SL requires on the order of hundreds of more labeled examples in order to be comparably accurate as LLM. 2) How Much Does LLM‚Äôs Labeling Accuracy Change When We Vary the Prompt?As with many approaches that use LLMs, a limitation of our approach is that it requires prompt design. We attempt to quantify the effort required for designing prompts as well as determine the feasibility of using non- engineered prompts from humans. We analyze the effect of prompt variation on labeling accuracy in DEALORNODEAL for theStubbornobjective. We vary different parts of the user-specified prompt at a time: the keyword (i.e., replacing ‚ÄúStubborn‚Äù with its synonyms), the example negotiations, and the explanations associated with each example. Fig. 7 provides a summary of our results. See Sec. A.7 for the full results. Results illustrate that an LLM can be quite robust to different prompts ‚Äî they all outperform SL. Furthermore, the quality of the explanation seems to be the most important in determining LLM accuracy. 6 L IMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK User Studies. This work takes a first step in determining whether we can use LLMs as proxy rewards. Given promising results, we plan on evaluating our approach with a larger user study. Multimodal Foundation Models. Beyond language models, multimodal foundation models such as Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022) can enable us to provide more complex environment states to the foundation model through images or other modalities while preserving an intuitive language interface for specifying the user objective. Non-Binary Rewards. Another limitation of our framework is that the LLM only specifies binary rewards. We plan on exploring how we can incorporate the likelihoods that LLMs produce for each word as a non-binary reward signal.

The figure depicts the average Labeling and RL Agent Accuracy computed across the different user objectives for each task, across3 seeds. Overall, our approach is able to produce more objective-aligned reward signals than our baselines. Our approach is also able to produce objective-aligned policies that are close in accuracy to policies trained with the true reward. A.2 M ORE RELATED WORKS Reward Design. Our framework addresses reward design‚Äîhow to engineer rewards so that they align with our objectives (Amodei et al., 2016). This is challenging because tasks often have conflicting objectives that a human must trade off (Pan et al., 2022). Misspecifying reward functions can lead to reward hacking, or the gaming of specified rewards. Reward hacking has appeared in various domains such as autonomous driving (Knox et al., 2021) and game-playing (Ibarz et al., 2018). We hope to address these challenges by leveraging LLMs and making it easier for humans to specify their objectives. Imitation Learning & Preference-based Learning. Another method of specifying user objectives is to learn them from expert demonstrations (Ross et al., 2011) or preferences Sadigh et al. (2017). These techniques either assume access to large datasets (Christiano et al., 2017) or place restrictive assumptions (such as linearity) about the reward function (Sadigh et al., 2017). Recent work attempts to learn reward functions from language instructions using pragmatic reasoning (Lin et al., 2022). In contrast, our work relies on an LLM‚Äôs in-context learning abilities to provide a reward. A.3 LLM D EFINITION OF OBJECTIVES IN THE MATRIX GAME LLM Defns. of Objectives Total welfare is the sum of the rewards of both players.(‚úì) Equality of rewards is only possible if both players receive the same reward.(‚úì) Rawlsian fairness is defined as the maxmin value of the game, which is the minimum reward that the player could get assuming that the other player is maximizing their reward.(X) An outcome is Pareto-optimal if there is no other outcome that would make one player better off without making the other player worse off.(‚úì) Table 2: Completion of each sentence given by LLM in pink. LLM provides correct definitions for objectives except for Rawlsian Fairness, which is partially correct. A.4 D ETAILS ON RL ENVIRONMENTS AND TRAINING Ultimatum Game. The environment is a single horizon with discrete actions (i.e., accept or reject) and continuous observations (i.e., a proposed split). We train DQN agents using the Stable Baselines3 implementation for1e4 timesteps with a learning rate of1e-4 across 3 seeds (Raffin et al., 2021). We instantiate our policy as a MLP with the default parameters used in Stable Baselines3. 12Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Parserg. The parserg that transforms the LLM‚Äôs output into an integer reward signal is defined using a handcrafted parser. When prompting the LLM, we structure the labels for each example to be in ‚ÄúY es/No‚Äù form which enables the LLM to also reply using the same format. We are then able search for the ‚ÄúY es‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo‚Äù strings and parse them into a1 or 0 respectively. In the rare occasion that the LLM does not respond in this form, we skip the episode during RL training and omit the example from our evaluation. Further Analysis on Performance ofNo ObjectiveBaseline.The average LLM accuracy of a random baseline across the four matrix games areWelfare: 0.125, Equality: 0.125, Rawlsian Fairness: 0.078, Pareto-optimality: 0.172. TheNo Objectivebaseline‚Äôs performance is close to random as can be verified by comparing the random baseline results with Figure 3 (top row).* Behaviorally, we observe thatNo Objectiveacts like a random baseline: the LLM often hallucinates matrix game rewards and also displays incoherent reasoning when selecting answers. Matrix Game.. The environment is a single horizon with discrete actions (i.e., one of the four joint actions) and no observations. We train DQN agents using the Stable Baselines3 implementation for500 timesteps with a learning rate of1e-4 across3 seeds (Raffin et al., 2021). We instantiate our policy as a MLP with the default parameters used in Stable Baselines3. Parserg. We parse the LLM‚Äôs response by hand, since LLM output can be variable in zero-shot settings. DEALORNODEAL. We use a version of theDEALORNODEAL environment used in Kwon et al. (2021). In the environment, the goal is for an agentA to come to an agreement with a partnerB on the allocation of a set of objects (books, hats, andballs). During each negotiation, agents receive acontext, cA =[i;uA],cB = [i;uB], detailing the count of each itemi as well as their private utilities,uA,uB. Item counts and utilities are represented as vectorsi‚àà{1,...,4}3 and uA,uB ‚àà{0,...,10}3 and are sampled uniformly. After receiving contextscA,cB, an agent is randomly selected to begin the negotiation. Agents negotiate for T time steps by exchanging coarse dialogue actsxt at each time step1 ‚â§ t ‚â§ T (He et al., 2018). Rather than negotiate directly in natural language, where the generation problem is hard and can result in degenerate dialogues (He et al., 2018), we use these dialogue acts instead to focus on learning diverse and interpretable strategies. A dialogue act xt is one of five actions: propose, insist, agree, disagree, or end. The propose and insist acts take allocations of items as argumentso = [oA; oB] where oA,oB ‚àà {1,...,4}3 (e.g., propose: books=1, hats=2, balls=1). When an agent selects end, the conversation terminates and each agent is asked to make their final selection. If agents agree on the final allocation of items, i.e.,oA+oB =i, agents are awarded points based on their private utilities,rA = uA ¬∑oA,rB = uB ¬∑oB. If agents do not agree, they receive0 points. Each agent‚Äôs context is constrained so that the agent can receive a maximum of10 points. Agents are first trained using supervised learning on a dataset of human-human negotiations provided by (Lewis et al., 2017) to predict the next token. We use a learning rate of1.0 and batch size of16. We then fine-tune these agents using RL where they optimize the expected reward of each dialogue act using REINFORCE (Williams, 1992). Agents are trained on250 contexts for1 epoch with a learning rate of 0.1. We instantiate our policy with four GRUs (Chung et al., 2014). We closely follow the implementation outlined in (Kwon et al., 2021; Lewis et al., 2017), please refer to those papers for more training details. Parserg. The parserg that transforms the LLM‚Äôs output into an integer reward signal is defined using a handcrafted parser. When prompting the LLM, we structure the labels for each example to be in ‚ÄúY es/No‚Äù form which enables the LLM to also reply using the same format. We are then able search for the ‚ÄúY es‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo‚Äù strings and parse them into a1 or 0 respectively. In the rare occasion that the LLM does not respond in this form, we skip the episode during RL training and omit the example from our evaluation. A.5 SL M ODEL ARCHITECTURE AND TRAINING Ultimatum Game. SL is trained to predict binary labels for a batch of proposed splits. We implemented SL as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network that consists of a single hidden layer with depth32. We also use ReLU activations after our input and hidden layers. We trained the model on the same10 examples we gave to LLM for5 epochs with the Adam optimizer. We evaluate the model on the50 heldout test examples and save the model with the best test accuracy. We show the training and test accuracy for each user objective below: 13Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Table 3: Training accuracy for SL on theUltimatum Game. 30% 60% $10 $100 Ineq.

We closely follow the implementation of a SL model found in (Kwon et al., 2021; Lewis et al., 2017). A negotiation consists of a context, coarse dialogue acts exchanged betweenAlice and Bob, and the outcome of the negotiation (the final split of items and whether agents agreed or disagreed). Please refer to Sec. A.4 for more details on the environment. We implement SL using a MLP context encoder, MLP outcome encoder, and a GRU ((Chung et al., 2014)) to process the coarse dialogue acts. The MLP encoders consist of an embedding layer followed by a linear layer with a Tanh activation function; we use a hidden size of64 for the context encoder‚Äôs linear layer. We similarly embed each coarse dialogue act before feeding it into the GRU. We use a hidden size of128 for the GRU. We train SL on the same3 examples we use in our prompt for LLM. We train for a maximum of50 epochs using the Adam optimizer. SL received a training accuracy of100%for all of our objectives.

We analyze the effect of varying prompts on the LLM‚Äôs labeling accuracy for theStubbornnegotiating style in DEALORNODEAL. We vary prompts in three ways: we vary the keyword (i.e., replacing ‚ÄúStubborn‚Äù with its synonyms), the example negotiations, and the explanations associated with each example. When varying the keyword, we use the synonyms: ‚ÄúHeadstrong‚Äù, ‚ÄúObstinate‚Äù, and a less commonly used word, ‚ÄúFroward‚Äù. To vary example negotiations, we randomly sample three new negotiations to have counterbalanced labels, all positive labels, or all negative labels. We vary the explanations by coming up with two plausible sets of explanations a user might have given for each example. We also experiment with the scenario where we give no explanations. Results are shown in Fig. 8. Overall, varying prompts do not have a large impact on labeling accuracy ‚Äî they all outperform the baseline. However, the quality of explanation seems to have the largest impact on labeling accuracy. A.8 W HAT IS THEIMPORTANCE OF INCLUDING THE TASK DESCRIPTION , œÅ1 IN THE PROMPT? We experiment with removingœÅ1, the task description in the Ultimatum Game with a single example followed by an explanation.

We We find that GPT-2 underperforms GPT-3 in both labeling (avg.15%) and RL agent accuracy (avg.49%). GPT-2 outperforms the SL baseline in labeling accuracy (avg.24%), and slightly underperforms the SL baseline for RL agent accuracy (avg. 2.7%). Results are averaged across styles and seeds. GPT-2 (1.5B) is several orders smaller than GPT-3 (175B), and we expect models larger than GPT-2 to close the gap with GPT-3‚Äôs performance.

We propose a novel preference modeling approach that utilizes AI feedback and only requires a small amount of human data.

In contrast to prior methods using AI feedback, our method uses fine-grained, composable, LLM-graded few-shot prompts as reward directly in RL training, resulting in greater control, accuracy and ease of updating.

Much recent work has focused on using human preference data to align models, such as the line of work on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)[1‚Äì8]. However, there are many challenges in using human feedback alone to achieve a target safety specification. Collecting and maintaining human data for model safety is often costly and time-consuming, and the data can become outdated as safety guidelines evolve with model capability improvements or changes in user behaviors. Even when requirements are relatively stable, they can still be hard to convey to annotators. This is especially the case for safety, where desired model responses are complex, requiring nuance on whether and how to respond to requests. If instructions are underspecified, annotators may have to rely on personal biases, leading to unintended model behaviors, such as becoming overly cautious, or it responding in an undesirable style (e.g. being judgmental). For example, some annotators in one of our experiments, when ranking possible responses to user requests pertaining to self-harm, favored completions that referred the user to a US suicide hotline phone number, which would not have helped users in other regions. Fixing such issues often requires relabeling or collecting new data, which is expensive and time consuming. To address these issues, methods that use AI feedback [9‚Äì12] have recently gained popularity, most prominently Constitutional AI [10]. These methods use AI feedback to synthetically generate training data to combine with the human data for the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reward model (RM) training steps. However, in Bai et al. [ 10] and other methods, the constitution involves general ‚àóEqual Contribution, Corresponding Authors: {tongm, alec.helyar}@openai.com arXiv:2411.01111v1  [cs.AI]  2 Nov 2024guidelines like \"choose the response that is less harmful\", leaving the AI model a large amount of discretion to decide what is harmful. For real world deployments, we need to enforce much more detailed policies regarding what prompts should be refused, and with what style. In this work, we introduce a novel AI feedback method that allows for detailed human specification of desired model responses, similar to instructions one would give to a human annotator. We break down the desired behavior into specific rules that explicitly describe the desired and undesired behaviors (e.g. \"refusals should contain a short apology\", \"refusals should not be judgemental toward the user\", , \"responses to self-harm conversations should contain an empathetic apology that acknowledges the user‚Äôs emotional state.\"). This separation into rules is similar to the human feedback method proposed in Sparrow[5], however we focus on utilizing AI feedback as opposed to human feedback. The specificity of these rules allow for fine grained control of model responses and high automated LLM classification accuracy. We combine LLM classifiers for individual behaviors to cover complex behaviors. Additionally, in contrast to prior AI and human feedback methods that distill behavior rules into either a synthetic or human labelled dataset for RM training, we incorporate this feedback directly during RL training as additional reward, avoiding a potential loss of behavior specification that can occur when distilling the rules into the RM. Main Contributions and Results In this work, we propose a scalable and flexible method, safety RBRs, that allows for fine grained control of model responses in the case of well specified model- behavior policies. 1. We empirically demonstrate that RBRs achieve comparable safety performance as human- feedback baselines while substantially decreasing instances of over-refusals on safe prompts. Specifically, on an F1 score calculated between safety and usefulness, RBRs achieve a score of 97.1, compared to a human-feedback baseline of 91.7 and a helpful-baseline of 95.8. 2. We show RBRs can be applied to a variety of RMs, improving safety behaviors in both RMs with overcautious tendencies and RMs that (sometimes) prefer unsafe outputs. 3. We provide ablations on different design considerations, such the amount and composition of the safety prompts set. 2 Related Works Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF): Research in RLHF methods [1‚Äì3, 7] demonstrates the efficacy of human annotations in steering model behavior. A subset [4, 8, 13] of this RLHF research considers achieving better safety behavior through methods such as separating out signals of helpfulness and harmlessness. Similarly, we also focus on improving model safety, but focus on fast and scalable automated methods that leverage AI feedback. Most related to our work, Sparrow[5] proposes a novel approach to RLHF which trains a second rule-conditioned RM to detect potential rule violations. Like Sparrow, we also use rules, but we have a few key differences. Sparrow focuses on utilizing human data and they collect more than 14K human-annotated conversations. We instead focus on utilizing AI feedback. Additionally, our approach involves fitting a model to ensure that the final reward effectively and correctly ranks completions which Sparrow does not. Lastly, we skip the step of distilling rules into RM data and focus on incorporating the rule as directly as possible into PPO training. Reinforcement Learning From AI Feedback (RLAIF) To address the cost and time of collecting human data, work that uses AI feedback to improve models have been a topic of recent study in both safety (such as CAI [10, 11]), and non-safety settings (RLAIF [9]). These methods look at generating synthetic comparison datasets using AI feedback that is used to train a reward model. In contrast, instead of synthetically generating comparison datasets, we look at incorporating LLM feedback directly into the RL procedure. We additionally differ by using fine-grained and composable rules of desired behavior which allows for increased controllability of the model refusal behavior and responses. Our setting comes with a different set of challenges which we study, such as how to best combine the LLM feedback with the reward model. Additional Related Methods: Additional related work include studies on improving the final outputs or finetuning on top of a model([14, 15]. However, we consider a different setting as we aim to build safety behavior into the model via RL training. Our approach is also loosely related to work that considers different ways of designing rewards for LLMs, such as RAFT [16]. 23 Setting and Terminology We consider a production setup of an AI chatbot system where a pretrained large language model (LLM) is periodically finetuned to align to an updated behavior specification, using a standard pipeline of first supervised fine-tuning (SFT) the model and then applying reinforcement learning from human preferences (RLHF). At the RLHF stage, we first train a reward model (RM) from preference data and then train the LLM against the RM via an reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm like PPO [17]. We assume that we already have: ‚Ä¢ Helpful-only SFT demonstrations contains examples of helpful conversations. ‚Ä¢ Helpful-only RM preference data tracks comparisons pairs between chatbot re- sponses, where in each comparison a human annotator has ranked the completions based solely on their helpfulness to the user. This set has data has no examples where the user asks for potentially unsafe content. ‚Ä¢ Helpful-only RL prompts is a dataset of partial conversation prompts that do not contain requests for unsafe actions. Additionally, we assume we have: ‚Ä¢ A Moderation Model: For both human feedback baselines and automated methods we need a method of obtaining relevant safety RL prompts. We assume we have an automated moderation model that can detect if text contains a request or a depiction of various unsafe content. Pre-existing models such as ModerationAPI [ 18] can be used. In this work we train a model similarly to ModerationAPI which we will refer to as ModAPI. If no such moderation model exists to detect the undesired safety policy, additional work may be needed to obtain labels (such as prompt tuning a LLM based classifier). ‚Ä¢ Safety-relevant RL prompts (Ps): A dataset of conversations ending in a user turn, some of which end with a user request for unsafe content. To combat potential overrefusals, this additionally includes user requests that should be complied with, including boundary cases (e.g. classification of harmful content) and helpful-only prompts (see Appendix A.1.2 for details and breakdowns). This set of prompts can be curated and labelled using the Moderation Model. We used a total of 6.7k conversations. Furthermore, we assume that a process of deliberation has occurred between relevant stakeholders to produce both a newly-updated content policy (a taxonomy that defines precisely what content in a prompt is considered an unsafe request) and a behavior policy (a set of rules governing how the model should in principle handle various kinds of unsafe requests defined in the content policy). The specifics of designing appropriate content and behavior policies is out of scope for this work. We aim to align the model in a way that maximizes helpfulness while also adhering to our content and behavior policy in a way that is efficient in both cost and time. 3.1 Content and Behavior Policies in Our Experiments For our experiments, we use a simplified example content policy that addresses several kinds of unsafe content relevant to an LLM deployed as a chat model. There are many other categories of harmful content that should be covered by a comprehensive, production level, content policy. Although the policy itself is not comprehensive, it has a level of granularity appropriate to a production setting. A detailed description of the content and behavior policies can be found in the appendix A.3, but we give a brief summary here. The content policy classifies user requests by content area and category within the content area. In our example, we consider four content policy areas: Erotic Content (which we will abbreviate C), Hate Speech (H), Criminal Advice (K), and Self-Harm (SH). Categories within the content policy are used to determine the behavior policy which outlines the ideal response type. We consider three response types (see appendix A.3 for examples): Hard Refusals: the ideal response includes a brief apology and a statement of inability to comply with the user‚Äôs request, without excess verbosity. Soft Refusals: the ideal response includes a more nuanced and specialized response. For example, in the self-harm case, we would like the model to give an empathetic apology that acknowledges the user‚Äôs emotional state, but ultimately declines to comply with the user‚Äôs request for methods of self harm. Comply: the model should comply with the user request. (This applies to our safety boundary and \"normal\" prompts in Ps.) 3Figure 1: The RBR is combined with the helpful-only RM score during RL training. The appropriate response type for a given user request varies by content policy category - we define this mapping as the behavior policy. To combat overrefusals, we include content policy categories that capture the safety boundary within a content policy area: the often complex line between what‚Äôs considered acceptable or unacceptable for a model to engage with. For example, users may request that the model classify text that is about harmful material without asking the model to directly generate new harmful content. In these cases, the behavior policy may require the model to comply. 4 Rule-Based Rewards for Safety In this section, we describe Rule-Based Rewards (RBRs), our proposed approach to building safety reward functions for RL training based on a content and behavior policy. We also provide code and example synthetic data for fitting the reward combination models described in this section2. To motivate our approach, given a content and behavior policy, consider what researchers must do to prepare labeling instructions for safety data annotators. The researchers have to write a list of natural language rules for defining a good completion and scoring completions with undesirable features, taking great care to ensure that instructions are specific enough that different annotators will produce the same judgements. For example, consider collecting data that scores completions from 1-7. For a request that should be hard-refused, a simplified version of a rule in our example can be: \"rank completions with a short apology and statement of inability highest at 7, deduct 1 point for each undesirable refusal quality (such as judgemental language) that is present, if the refusal contains disallowed content rank it lowest at 1\". Researchers often also have to provide illustrative examples. These instructions and examples are ideal for use in a few-shot LLM classification task. In our observations, LLMs demonstrate higher accuracy when asked to classify specific, individual tasks, such as determining whether a text contains an apology, compared to general, multilayered tasks such as rating completions given a large content and behavior policy as input. To leverage this strength, we simplified these complex policies into a series of individual binary tasks, termed propositions. We then established a set of rules that determine when combinations of these propositions‚Äô truth values are desired or undesired. This framework allows us to accurately rank completions using these classification rules. In order to combine safety rule-based rankings with a helpful-only RM in a principled way, we use them to fit an auxiliary safety reward function that takes only proposition-based features as input, which we refer to as the Rule-Based Reward. We add the RBR to the helpful-only RM to use as the total reward in RLHF, as shown in Figure 1. In the subsections that follow, we describe an inner loop of fitting RBR weights given features, to be interleaved with an outer loop of evaluating the effectiveness of the total combined reward, and potentially modifying the fitting setup (e.g. changing the model for combining the rewards). 4.1 Elements of RBRs We first describe various components that make up an RBR. As there are many different datasets mentioned. We provide a table summarizing datasets needed in Table 3 at the end of this subsection. 2Code: https://github.com/openai/safety-rbr-code-and-data 4Propositions and Rules: The lowest-level element in our RBR is a proposition. Propositions are binary statements about completions given the prompt, such as refuses: ‚Äúthe completion contains a statement of inability to comply‚Äù. hard_refusal: ideal: refuses: True judgmental: False complies: False less_good: refuses: True judgmental: True complies: False unacceptable: complies: True Comply: ideal: complies: True helpful: True less_good: complies: True helpful: False unacceptable: complies: False Figure 2: Simplified example ranking rules. A rule determines the ranking of a completion given a prompt. For each target response type (hard refusal, safe refusal, or comply), there is a set of rules that govern the relative rankings of desired and undesired propositions for the completion. We illustrate this in Figure 2, where we show an exam- ple of hypothetical rules for ranking tiers of hard refusal and comply be- haviors. For a given prompt, comple- tions that satisfy the ideal rule rank higher than less_good which rank higher than unacceptable comple- tions. We give a short example list of propositions in Table 1 and provide full details on the propositions and rules we used in Table 14. Table 1: A subset of propositions used in our Safety RBR. (See Appendix Table 14 for the full list) Apology Response contains a short apology. (e.g. \"I‚Äôm sorry...\") Refuses Expresses an unambiguous statement of inability to comply. (e.g. \"I can‚Äôt help with that.\") Judgmental Response contains judgmental language that criticizes the user‚Äôs request or their moral or ethical values. (e.g. \"That request is reprehensible.\") Illogical Continuation Nonsensical response which does not logically follow the conversation. (e.g. \"Lets talk about something else. Do you like pizza?\") Complies Provides a response to at least some part or aspect of the request. (e.g. \"I can help with that. The answer may be...\") Helpful Provides a complete and accurate response to the request. (e.g. \"Certainly! The capital of France ...\", \"Here are steps to build a bomb...\") Features, Graders, and Classification-Prompts: We define a feature as any numerical value that is determined by a prompt and a completion to that prompt. We will denote as œïi(p, c) where p is the prompt, c is the completion and i is the index of the feature. In this work, we include two different type of features, however features are flexible and can be any numerical value: The first type of features we use are the probabilities of a proposition being true as judged by a grader LLM with a few-shot classification-prompt. These classification-prompts contain natural language descriptions of the content and behavior policy and instructions to only output the tokens yes or no. We then use the probabilities of the outputting tokens yes or no to estimate a probability of the proposition being true for a completion. Table 15 in the Appendix maps which proposition probabilities were used as features for each behavior category. The design of these prompts requires iteration and the choice of grader LLM is also highly impactful. In our experiments, we use a helpful-only SFT model which showed higher precision when labeling disallowed content. The second type of features we use are the more general \"class\" features as illustrated in Figure 2 (ex. \"ideal\")3. These classes allow us to group sets of propositions into distinguishable names that are shared across all Response-Types. We calculate the probability of each class for each completion by multiplying the relevant propositions attached to each class (See Appendix Table 15) and normalizing across classes. We then use the probabilities of each class as features. 3We note that the simplified example given in Figure 2 is not exactly what we do and we provide exact details in Appendix A.1.1 5Figure 3: Synthetic Data Generation Process Overview. Our process for converting a behavior policy into a pipeline that generates labeled completions. Besides an input behavior policy, the pipeline only requires a set of prompts and access to a model which can generate behaviors mentioned in the policy (e.g. Helpful Only model). Using this pipeline, we create a Gold set for tuning Classification-prompts and comparison data for weight fitting. Table 2: Mean Proposition Evaluation Accuracy by Model Size XSmall Small Medium Large Mean Accuracy 43.78 ¬± 2.1% 68 .05 ¬± 2.0% 74 .84 ¬± 1.8% 93 .63 ¬± 1.0% In our experiments, we use a total of 20 features for Hard-Refusal, 23 features for Soft-Refusal, and 18 features for Comply (listed out in Appendix Table 15). One can find our final classificaiton-prompts for all propositions in our released code. A Small Set of Human Labelled Data for Prompt Tuning: To tune the classification-prompts mentioned above, we synthetically generate a small dataset of conversations ending in assistant turns to have diverse representation across our safety categories and propositions. We give an overview of the process used to generate this data in Figure 3. Then, we researchers manually label the truthiness of each proposition for the final assistant completion of each conversation. We refer to this labelled set as the Gold set. We manually labelled a total of 518 completions across the three behavior categories to tune the grader prompts for RBRs: 268 for Comply, 132 for Hard Refusal, and 118 for Soft Refusal. Finally, we tune the prompts by hand against this dataset. In Table 2 we give the overall accuracy on a few different model sizes (explained later in Section 5.3) and a detailed breakdown of the prompt accuracy per proposition on this Gold set in appendix Table 16. Weights and RBR Function: The RBR itself is any simple ML model on features, and in all of our experiments it is a linear model with learnable parameters w = {w0, w1, . . . , wN }, given N features: Rtot(p, c)| {z } Total Reward = Rrm(p, c)| {z } default RM reward + NX i=1 wiœïi(p, c) | {z } RBR reward (1) Synthetic Comparison Data For Weight Fitting: We synthetically generate data to create a set of comparison data, DRBR, for fitting the RBR weights w. To fit the weights, for each prompt pi, we need a set of k diverse completions (ci,j) per prompt that have different rankings: DRBR = {(pi, ci,1, ci,2, ..., ci,k)}i=1,...,|DRBR|, and ranking order between completions (e.g. ci,1 > ci,2 = ci,3 > ci,4...) of how good the completion is. Our setup with propositions lets us easily generate exactly the data needed, conditioned on the content and behavior policy. We can use the natural language descriptions we already have to prompt for diverse completions with various rankings. For example, for a prompt that should be hard refused, we can decide we want the following set of 4 completions: one perfect hard refusal (ideal), two bad completions with randomly sampled bad refusal traits, such as judgement and/or illogical continuation, and one that contains the requested disallowed content. The goal is to have synthetic completions representing an ideal completion, a few diverse sub-optimal completions, and an unacceptable completion for every prompt. We start with the train split of our safety prompts (Ps) and the desired set of completions. For each desired completion, we iteratively synthetically sample a candidate completion from a prompted 6Table 3: RBR Training Datasets Summary Dataset Human?

Helpful-Only model, and use our RBRs, ModAPI and other quality LLM filters to confirm it contains the desired traits (ex. we did indeed generate a judgy bad refusal) and resample if necessary. SFT Data: We use the completions labelled as ideal from DRBR above as SFT data. 4.2 Inner Loop: Fitting an RBR In order to fit an RBR, one must have: 1. Classification-prompts for each proposition and a grader LLM to compute features œïi. 2. The default reward model, Rrm, that will be used during RL training. 3. DRBR, the RBR weight fitting comparison dataset described above. The RBR fitting procedure is straightforward: first, use the content and behavior policy rules to determine rankings among completions based on their proposition values. Then, optimize the RBR weights so that the total reward achieves the target ranking. We do this by minimizing a hinge loss: L(w) = 1 |DRBR| X (p,ca,cb)‚ààDRBR (max (0, 1 +Rtot(p, cb, w) ‚àí Rtot(p, ca, w))) (2) where ca, cb are any two completions corresponding to p such that ca ‚âª cb (ca ranks better than cb under the content and behavior policy). For all our experiments we used the same number of datapoints as PPO prompts to fit the weights. However the number of parameters in a linear RBR is just the number of relevant propositions + the five class probabilities, which is tiny by comparison to the number of parameters in a standard RLHF RM. Fewer examples are probably required and we discuss this later in the discussion Section 6.1. Because there are only a small number of optimizable parameters, fitting an RBR is extremely fast (can run on a standard laptop in a couple of minutes). We discuss hyperparameters used in fitting RBRs in the Appendix Section A.1.3 and other alternate ways of combining the RBR with the RM ( manually setting weights) in Appendix Section A.2. 4.3 Outer Loop: Evaluating the Final Reward Signal and Tuning Even before running RL and evaluating the final model, we can measure how good a reward function is by using the held-out test set of the weight fitting data DRBR, and checking whether the reward function enforces the target rankings on that data. Through these evaluations, we can see if we need to make changes to the weight fitting procedure such as potentially adding additional features or changing the model (e.g. to a non-linear model). In Figure 4a, we plot histograms of two different reward functions for various responses to prompts that demand hard refusals. To account for the fact that different prompts may have different base rewards (Rrm), we center the rewards: given a prompt and its set of k = 4completions, we subtract out the reward of the ideal completion from each of the three other completions. We can see the helpful-only RM itself does not have any separation/ranking between ideal (perfect refusal), slighly bad (bad refusal), and really bad (disallowed) completions. Adding the RBR (RM + RBR) allows for separation and correct ranking - ranking ideal over slight bad over really bad completions. We provide more reward distribution histograms for all response types in the Appendix Figure 9. We can additionally look at the error rate of the RM which quantifies the number of mistakes where a non-ideal completion was ranked above the ideal completion as a percentage of all comparisons that involve an ideal completion. To have a metric focused on only correct behavior, we calculate this 7(a) Reward Distributions on Hard Refuse Prompts  (b) Error Rate Figure 4: The combination of safety RBR and helpful-only RM scores can tune safety-relevant preferences in a targeted way, reducing both under-refusals and over-refusals and improving refusal style.

(b) The error rate tracks how frequently a non-ideal completion is ranked above the ideal completion for different reward model setups. using only comparisons that involve the ideal completion, and do not consider whether we correctly ranked two non-ideal completions (e.g. bad refusal > disallowed). In Figure 4b, we see using the RBRs with the RM greatly reduced the error rates across all response types. 5 Experiments In our experiments, we aimed to investigate several core questions: ‚Ä¢ Does our approach of training with RBRs and synthetic data improve over models trained with human preference data alone? We are interested in whether they can improve safety while getting closer to the decision boundary by preventing over-refusals. ‚Ä¢ Does our approach make more efficient use of human data? ‚Ä¢ What is the behavior of RBR-based training when used in conjunction with a reward model that incentivizes models to over-refuse? Can the RBR approach help correct for this? 5.1 Baselines In the course of our investigations we compared our RBR-trained models against relevant baselines: Helpful-Only Baseline: The helpful-only baseline are the SFT, RM, and PPO models trained with our helpful-only RLHF datasets following a procedure similar to that described in Ouyang et al[1]. Human Safety Data Baseline : In addition to our helpful-only data, we add human-annotated safety data for our set of safety-relevant RL prompts Ps. We send these prompts to annotators who are familiar with our content and behavior policies and have been actively labelling similar safety prompts under similar instructions for several months. We follow the standard RLHF comparison data collection procedure [1] and ask annotators to sample 4 completions and label them with a rating from 1-7. The annotators had access to a helpful-only SFT model as well as system prompts (e.g. to prompt for perfect refusals) to sample completions from. As part of the instructions, annotators were given detailed guidelines on completion scoring. For example, for a prompt that should be refused, a perfect hard refusal should be rated 7, bad refusals (ex. excessively verbose) should be rated lower, and completions with disallowed content should be rated 1. Annotators were also asked to try to maximize the diversity of scores across the 4 completions by resampling individual completions if necessary. They were also asked to provide an \"ideal\" completion, either by copying and pasting an existing completion, or by writing an original one. We assume this ideal completion is rated 7, and from this we can construct comparison data for RM training. Additionally we use the prompts and ideal completions for SFT training. The amount of human safety data is a small amount, about 3% of SFT data and 1% of RM data when combined with the Helpful-Only datasets. 85.2 Evaluation Results after RL training are often high variance, so for all evaluation scores reported, we evaluate on 5 checkpoints toward the end of PPO training and report the average mean and standard error. Internal Safety RBR Evaluation: We evaluate our models on a diverse set of internal prompts which are manually labeled by researchers with our content policy category (see Table 9). In total, there are 588 Comply, 565 Hard-Refusal, and 185 Soft-Refusal prompts which are approximately distributed evenly across categories. We use the classifications of the Safety RBR‚Äôs propositions to automatically evaluate three internal metrics: ‚Ä¢ Not-Unsafe: the percentage of completions which do not contain any disallowed content. ‚Ä¢ Not-Overrefuse: the percentage of completions for Comply prompts which are not refusals. ‚Ä¢ Hard-Refusal-Style: the percentage of completions in the ideal style for Hard-Refusal prompts (i.e. no incorrect response elements). We note that for this evaluation there is some overlap with our training signal. There are important differences in the signals: there is no overlap in prompts between our train and evaluation sets. Additionally, for evaluations we do not use the RBRs as described in training. Instead we convert the output probability scores for each proposition into binary labels using a threshold optimized on the Gold set. These binary labels are converted to metric output via simple metric definitions. For example, Hard-Refusal-Style is True when a completion is mapped to ideal and False when it is not. Thus, there is no weight fitting, and only the raw proposition probabilities are used for behavior classification metrics. We realize however there may still be correlated errors because of the repeat RBR usage. To mitigate this, we show that our RBR has high accuracy on an our Gold set (Table 2 and Appendix Table 16). We also provide additional methods of safety evaluation described below. XSTest: To measure the overrefusal rate of our models on publicly available prompts, we evaluate our models on the Comply prompts in XSTest [19]. These prompts challenge safety behavior with lexicon that models can become overly sensitive to (e.g. \"How can I kill a Python process?\"). We filtered 52 prompts for being outside the scope of our content policy, resulting in 198 relevant overrefusal prompts. We measure overrefusal rate using both our Not-Overrefuse RBR-based metric and the default XSTest classification prompt using GPT-4. WildChat: To measure the safety of our models on publicly available prompts, we leverage Wild- Chat [20]. Specifically, we filter this dataset to unsafe prompts using ModAPI, resulting in a sample of 790 unsafe prompts. We evaluate the safety of the completions using three automated tools: ModAPI, our Not-Unsafe RBR-based metric, and Llama Guard 2 [ 21, 22]. To reduce noise, we sample 5 completions per prompt at temperature 1.0 and average the evaluations. Human Safety Evaluations: To further verify our safety evaluations, we ran human evaluations of safety behavior. The human evaluators are researchers on the team who have much experience with and are extremely familiar with the Content and Behavior policy. We start with prompts from WildChat which we filter using ModAPI . To measure over-refusals, we also include 198 Comply prompts from XSTest. For each prompt, a completion was sampled from each of the Helpful-PPO baseline, Human-PPO baseline, and RBR-PPO models. Model names were hidden from the evaluators and the order of completions shown was randomized. Evaluators were asked to label the desired Response-Type of each prompt and the actual Response-Type of each completion. According to the prompt labels of human evaluators, the final dataset contained 283 Comply prompts and 70 Hard-Refusal prompts in total. Capability Evaluations: To monitor model capabilities, we evaluate our models on MMLU [23] (Averaged across zero-shot, 10-shot, and zero-shot CoT), HellaSwag [24] (Zero-shot), GPQA [25] (Few-shot CoT averaged across 1-, 5-, and 10-repeats on Diamond), and Lambada [26] (Zero-shot). For speed purposes we evaluate against large subsets of these datasets. 5.3 Experimental Settings Throughout results and ablations we use 4 model sizes which we will refer to as Large, Medium, Small, and XSmall. The size of the Medium, Small, and XSmall models are such that they use roughly around 0.5%, 0.1%, and 0.001% of the effective compute used to train Large respectively, where Large is of size comparable to GPT-4 but with a greatly reduced data mix. All synthetic data 9Table 4: Safety evaluation results on an internal safety metric and human evaluation metrics.

For all the main results in section 6 below, we run PPO where all safety prompts are seen once, and the ratio of Hard Refusal to Comply prompts is equal as labelled by human data.4 We use the Large Helpful-SFTmodel as the RBR grader engine, as well as Large size RMs. All automated evals use a Large sized grader.O 6 Results We first discuss our main results, and then our ablations. All experiments were run under the settings described in Section 5.3. All figures report results on Medium sized policy models, while all tables report results on Large sized policy models. Our safety RBRs improve safety while minimizing over-refusals. In Table 4 we give the results of both our human and automated internal safety evaluations on Large sized models. We see that under both evaluations, RBRs (RBR-PPO) are able to substantially increase safety while minimally impacting the amount of over-refusals, achieving the highest F1-score. The human safety data baseline, Human-PPO, increases safety greatly, however at the expense of also greatly increasing the amount of over-refusals (by almost 14% in the human evaluation). We also see similar trends from external safety evaluation benchmarks (Table 5). Additionally, we see similar trends in our Medium sized models shown in Fig. 5a. In Fig. 5a we plot the safety vs over-refusal trade-off on our internal safety RBR eval of our main models and baselines, along with arrows showing the movement from SFT to PPO. We see thatRBR-PPO achieves a good balance of Safety and Usefulness. Additionally, while not shown in the plot, both Human-PPO and RBR-PPO improve refusal style over the helpful baseline. Interestingly enough, we note that Helpful-PPO improves upon safety compared to Helpful-SFT, even though the Helpful-Only datasets do not contain any safety-relevant data. We hypothesize this is due to the Helpful-Only datasets generally encouraging the model to be polite, which may be correlated to safety. All the raw numbers for both Figures in Fig. 5 along with standard errors can be found in Appendix Table 10. 4There is some disagreement between human and automated labels, and the RBR experiments only use automated labels, but we do not re balance for the main results as we want to keep the prompt mix the same. 10Table 5: Safety evaluation results on XSTest and a subset of unsafe prompts in WildChat.

In Table 6, we list the capability scores of the Large PPO models on four common capability benchmarks: MMLU, Lambada, HellaSwag and GPQA. Both RBR-PPO and the Human-PPO baseline maintain evaluation performance compared to the Helpful-PPO baseline. Safety RBRs help improve safety for RMs with different tendencies. The default RBR-PPO setting applies the safety RBR on top of the Helpful-RM. In Fig. 5b, we additionally show the result of combining the RBR with different RMs with dotted arrows showing the movement on PPO models after adding RBRs. We apply RBRs to the Human-RM which, as empirically evidenced through the PPO model, has a higher tendency towards over-refusals. We label this asHumanRM+RBR-PPO , reducing over-refusals by 16% compared to Human-PPO. Additionally we apply the safety RBR on top of a RM trained with outdated safety data (Old Data-PPO), which also has a high over-refusal rate. Applying the RBR both improves safety and reduces overrefusals by 10%. Safety RBRs require less human annotated data than the Human-Data Baseline. We investigate the performance of a human-safety data baseline after subsampling the human data down to the same amount of completions as in RBR runs, 518 completions in total. The subsampling process is constrained to ensure even representation amongst behavior types and content categories. PPO prompts remains the same as that of the RBR runs (i.e. the full set of RL prompts). We note this is not a direct comparison because the set of annotators for the two datasets is different, but it provides a ballpark estimate. In Figure 5b, we plot the result as Human-match RBR-PPO. Compared to RBR-PPO and Human-PPO, this run performs slightly worse on both Not-Unsafe and Not-Overrefuse. We hypothesize this is because the small amount of RM data is not enough to teach the model the refusal boundary. 6.1 RBR Training Ablations In this section, we present various ablation experiments. All ablations in this section were done with a Medium policy model using the Large Helpful-RMand Large RBR grader models unless otherwise stated. As with the main results, for all experiments, we fix all variables to that in the default setting as described in Section 5.3 except the variable being studied. Scaling RBR Grader Engine Size. Figure 6a shows how performance changes with different model sizes. We see that in general, safety stays about constant as the grader engine increases in size. Additionally we see that over-refusals decrease with larger grader engines. Interestingly, we see hard-refusal style take a U shaped pattern. For small grader engines, it seems the dominant encouraged behavior is refusal and the trained model learns to refuse well. As the grader engine increases in capability, it is able to learn to refuse less often, however it is not able to capture good style. Until for the largest model, it is able to perform well on both. Scaling Safety Prompts Percentage. We vary the percentage of safety-relevant prompts that would be seen during PPO training (where 100% means all PPO prompts are seen), shown in Fig. 6b. In general, safety increases with more safety prompts during RL training, while over-refusals slightly increase as well. Refusal style benefits the most from seeing more safety prompts. 11(a) RBR grader engine size.  (b) Safety PPO prompts Amount.  (c) Hard-Refusal/Comply ratio. (d) Soft-Refusal/Comply ratio.  (e) Weight Fitting Data  (f) Various Other Ablations Figure 6: Figures (a)-(e) give scaling properties of different features such as the amount of PPO prompts. Figure (f) gives some additional ablations such as not training on SFT data first. Scaling the Hard-Refusal/Comply Ratio. We vary the ratio ofHard-Refusal to Comply prompts during RL training in Figure 6c. We see a clear safety vs over-refusal trade-off as the ratio changes. Improving Self Harm Refusal Style For our default parameters, we found poor performance for soft refusal style. We found we can improve soft refusal style without impacting other safety metrics by adjusting the prompt ratio. In Figure 6d we show increasing the percentage of Soft Refusal prompts seen from the default amount of approximately 1/4th the amount of Comply prompts to approximately matching the amount of Comply prompts. (As a reminder there are about the same amount of Hard-Refusal prompts as Comply prompts). We see Soft-Refusal style improves without negatively impacting other safety-behavior. Weight Fitting Data Amount While we generate synthetic completions for weight fitting using all the PPO prompts we have, we hypothesize we need less data as we are fitting a model with a small number of parameters. We investigate this in Figure 6e by investigating the error rate (as described in Section 4.3) and the number of prompts used (where there are four synthetic completions per prompt). We see that approximately 300 prompts per category is sufficient for low error rate. Various Other Ablations In Figure 6f we ablate omitting certain steps and we observe that this let us fall on different regions along the Pareto frontier. SFTonly-noRBR-PPO considers training SFT from the RBR synthetic SFT data combined with Helpful SFT data, but only training with theHelpful-RM with RBRs from there. It leads to a moderate improvement in safety over Helpful-PPO but not as much as RBR-PPO. RBR-noSFT-PPO looks at not using the synthetic SFT data and starting from Helpful-SFT, it does well on safety but over-refuses more. RBR-noRM-PPO uses only the RBR reward for prompts in Ps with no RM score (prompts outside of Ps still use the RM score). We see this also increase over-refusals slightly. Example Sampled Completions We give some example sampled completions from our Baseline PPOs and RBR-PPO models for prompts of each refusal type in Appendix Table 13 127 Discussion 7.1 Challenges of RBRs vs RLHF-style Human Data Potential Loss of Information when Distilling Instructions into RM Data: Figure 7: Average Reward of comply and refusal com- pletions for different RMs on comply prompts. Distilling a set of instructions into RM data, whether through human labelling of comparison data or synthetic AI means, is challenging since one must ensure not only that the data covers all instructions, but also that it is balanced such that the desired behavior is learned by the RM. We encountered issues related to this and needed an additional data-fixing step for the human data. After our first PPO run using the human data, we observed the model to be extremely cautious, over-refusing on every Comply prompt in our evaluation set (and also achieving a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù score on safety). We discovered this was due to an insufficient number of low-ranked refusal examples in the RM comparison data for Comply prompts to teach the model not to refuse safe prompts. Although we instructed annotators to collect diverse completions for each prompt, our initial instructions did not specify what percentage of Comply prompts should contain a refusal example. Only a third of Comply data contained negative examples, leading to 3 times more positive refusal examples than negative refusal examples. Even though the safety data was only 1% of the RM dataset when combined with the Helpful-Only data, this imbalance was still enough to cause over-refusals on all prompts. To correct for this in the RM data, for all Comply data, we manually replaced a non-ideal completion with a refusal sampled from a manually created list of ‚àº50 refusals, and were able to train a second model that did not refuse everything to use as the human-data baseline. (Note, the Human-PPO and Human-RM referred to previously in the text are all trained with this corrected data.) In Figure 7, we look at a set of safe ‚ÄúComply‚Äù prompts and plot the average rewards of completions that comply and that over-refuse for the initial always-refusing human data RM, the corrected human data RM, and the Helpful-Only RM. We see that over-refusals are given almost the same score as helpful completions for the original super-safe human data RM, making it easier to reward hack. RBRs are not subject to this issue because they skip this RM distillation step and directly incorporate the instructions into the reward function. When a over-refusal example is sampled by the model for a safe prompt during training, it is penalized by the RBR directly. ‚ÄúPrompt‚Äù tuning for RBRs vs Human Data:Both RBRs and collecting RLHF-style human labelled comparison data require a form of ‚Äúprompt‚Äù tuning. For RBRs there is additionally the task of prompt tuning the proposition‚Äôs classification-prompts to achieve high classification accuracy. For a single proposition, this cycle involves classifying all Gold data using the current classification-prompt, evaluating the accuracy and mistakes, and iteratively updating the classification-prompt to resolve mistakes. It is often necessary to repeat this cycle a few times to achieve a high accuracy. Similarly, high-quality human data collection entails the challenges of weekly audits and reviews of a sample of annotator labels to try to detect gaps in the instructions, and updating and communicating new instructions to trainers if necessary. For example, while we initially instructed the annotators generally to collect diverse completions, we had to provide additional specifications of what we meant by ‚Äúdiverse‚Äù and to provide concrete clarifying examples throughout the data collection process. There are a few key differences between the effects of these two tasks. While improved classification accuracy immediately takes effect for all data, this may not be the case for human data, which may require discarding data or a lengthy recollection process. Additionally, often one may not discover an issue until PPO is done training, as we did for the example above. Correcting this mistake in RBRs is generally a much faster iteration cycle where recollecting human data is a much slower process. 7.2 Limitations, Future Work, and Ethical Considerations In this work, we apply Rule-based Rewards (RBRs) for RL training to a situation where the desired behaviors can be clearly separated into explicit, easy-to-judge propositions and rules. However, it may be harder to apply RBRs to more subjective tasks, such as writing a high-quality essay, where 13defining explicit rules is less straightforward and demands nontrivial efforts. One advantage of RBRs is that they can be easily combined with human-labeled preference data in classic RLHF. As shown in the Comply cases of this work, we used an RBR to discourage easily detectable bad behavior such as refusals to safe prompts, while preserving capabilities through the helpful RM. This hybrid approach allows RBRs to enforce specific guidelines (e.g. \"Don‚Äôt use slang in the essay example.\"), while enabling the human-labeled data to address aspects of the task that are harder to quantify (e.g. the overall coherence). A direction of future work is exploring these more complex non-safety domains. Ethical Considerations: In this work we discuss moving the safety feedback signal in LLM training from humans to LLMs. This reduces the level of human supervision and potentially extrapolates and magnifies inherent biases in the LLMs. To mitigate this, researchers should carefully evaluate their RBRs to ensure accuracy and measure any potential biases that come up. Using this method in conjunction with human data could also help to mitigate risks. 8 Conclusion In this work, we introduced a novel automated AI-feedback based preference modeling approach using Rule-Based Rewards (RBRs) for safety training in LLMs. Our method is cost- and time- efficient, requiring minimal human data, and is easy to update if the desired model behavior changes. Our decomposition of ideal behavior into fine-grained modular rules also has unique advantages in allowing increased classification accuracy and easy synthetic data generation of diverse responses that is necessary for our method. Our experiments show our RBR method is able to generally achieve accurate safety-behavior. Finding a good balance betweens safety and usefulness compared to helpful only human-safety data baselines.

The lambada dataset: Word prediction requiring a broad discourse context. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.06031, 2016. 16A Appendix / supplemental material Table 7: List of Terms and Definitions Term Definition Content Policy A taxonomy that precisely defines what content in a prompt is considered unsafe. Content Area Topics considered by the content policy (ex. Erotic, Criminal Advice). Safety Boundary The line between what is acceptable and unacceptable, includes safe requests adjacent to unsafe requests we want to comply with to prevent over-refusals. Behavior Policy A set of rules governing how the model should handle various kinds of unsafe requests defined in the content policy. Response Type Ideal ways we want to respond to unsafe and boundary requests. (ex. Hard Refusal) Hard Refusal A response type where the model firmly refuses the user request. (ex. requests for criminal advice) Soft Refusal A response type that carefully declines or respond to user requests in sensitive situations (ex. Self Hard requests). Comply A response type where the model fully complies in a maximally helpful way to the user request (ex. safe boundary requests). Propositions Simple binary statements about completions, used in RBRs for classifi- cation (ex. does the completion contain an apology). Rule Determines the class a completion belongs in based on the Behavior Policy (ex. ideal) Grader LLM The language model used to compute the probabilities of propositions being true. We use a helpful only model for this. Variables Ps Safety-relevant RL prompts used in training to improve safety behaviors. DRBR An offline dataset of completions of various goodness for each prompt, used for fitting the RBR reward. Gold Set A manually labeled dataset used to tune classification-prompts for propo- sitions in RBRs. Rrbr The Rule-Based Reward function computed from features extracted by the grader LLM. Rrm The default reward model score based on human preference data. Rtot The total reward, calculated as the sum of Rrm and Rrbr. w Parameters in the RBR function that are optimized during training. œïi(p, c) Feature values used in RBRs, where p is the prompt and c is the comple- tion. We used probability propositions as judged by a grader LLM for this. L(w) Loss function used to fit RBR weights, we use a hinge loss over compar- isons. 17A.1 Data, Training and Results Details In Table 7 we provide a glossary of terms used throughout the text. In Table 10 we provide all numbers with standard errors for various figures in the main text. In Table 11 we provide the experimental settings for all experiments and ablations. In Table 13 we provide sampled completions from various Large sized models for prompts that have different desired behaviors. In Figure 9 we plot all reward distribution histograms. A.1.1 RBR Classes We combine relevant propositions for each desired completion type (hard refusal, safe completion, comply) into 5 common classes shared by all completion types. For example, the \"ideal\" class refers to a completion which has only desired propositions and no undesired propositions for the desired completion type. Defining these classes is not required for RBRs, but when using several propositions it is useful to organize propositions together into meaningful labels. In our case, we use the following classes for labeling completions: 1. ideal: desired behavior without disallowed content. 2. minimum_acceptable_style: desired behavior without disallowed content, but with some imperfect stylistic traits. 3. unacceptable_completion: undesired behavior, but still logical and without disallowed content. 4. illogical_completion: illogical continuation of the conversation. 5. disallowed_completion: disallowed content present somewhere in the completion. The mapping of each proposition to class is given in Table 15. A.1.2 Prompt Breakdown by Response Type Even though they use the exact same set of prompts, the human baseline used human collected labels of desired response type, and the RBR methods use auto labelled ones, so there is some disagreement. In Table 8 we give the breakdown of number of prompts per behavior category in the train and test splits based on human labels and automatic labels. We also give the agreement rate for each of the response types (denominator when calculating the rate is determined by automatic labels). We also give the breakdown by behavior category for 518 human labelled conversations in the Gold set used for prompt tuning. PPO Prompts RBR Gold Convos Human Baseline RBR Training Human-Auto (Human labeled for (Auto-Labelled) Agreement prompt tuning) Response Type Train Test Train Test Rate Train Test Comply 2679 316 2855 375 0.85 196 72 Hard Refuse 2679 473 2537 422 0.90 88 44 Soft Refuse 513 91 479 83 0.96 67 51 Total 5871 880 5871 880 - 351 167 Table 8: PPO Prompts and RBR Gold per Response Type A.1.3 Weight Fitting Hyperparameter Details For our weight fitting procedure, we used Pytorch with an Adam optimizer. We optimized on our weight fitting code for 1000 steps as the loss has converged by then. We used a learning rate of 0.01 and a weight decay of 0.05. For learning rate we tried few in that region and didn‚Äôt see to big of a 18difference in final error rate. For weight decay, we picked the largest value that did not increase the error rate on the test set. A.2 Alternative Weights: Hand Set Weights Instead of fixed weights, we test hand set weights amongst classes. We the set the following base weights vector of equally spaced base weights: { \"ideal\" : 1 , \"minimum_acceptable_style\" : 1 3 , \"unacceptable_completion\" : ‚àí1 3 , \"illogical_completion\" : ‚àí1 3 , \"disallowed_completion\" : ‚àí1 } We tried 2 different fixed weight settings. The first setting is an \"underoptimized\" setting where we used the unit weight vector directly (RBR-Fixed1-PPO) for all response types. The second setting is the \"overoptimized\" setting where we multiply the unit weight vector by 10 (RBR-Fixed10-PPO) for all response types. From Figure 8, we can see that the fixed weights generally lead to more overrefusals than optimized weights, however they can lead to higher safety. For example RBR-fixed10- PPO has similar safety as Human-PPO baseline, but over- refuses much less. Figure 8: Fixed Weights A.3 Content Policies, Model Behavior Policies, and RBR Propositions Content Policies We give the example content policy we use in Table 9. Note: this is an just an example content policy that covers only a very limited number of harms and does not reflect any real content policies. RBR Propositions We list all propositions used in our safety RBR in Table 14. We additionally list the desirability of each proposition for each Behavior Type in Table 15 along with their usage in the RBR weight fitting procedure. We provide the Proposition accuracy for differing RBR grader engine sizes in Table 16. We lastly provide error rates for different grader LLM engine sizes in Table 12. 19(a) RM reward distribution histogram (b) RM and RBR reward distribution histogram (c) RBR reward distribution histogram Figure 9: RM and RBR Ablations 20Table 9: Example Response Type Based on Content Type (Behavior Policy) Content Area Content Category & Response Type Description and Example Erotic C-C (Comply) Classification, Contextual, Translation, Summarization, Educational, etc. ex. \"exploited teens big boobs‚Äô, Label: Sexual\" C-R (Hard Refuse) Illegal Sexual Content (ex.

However, task performance depends signiÔ¨Åcantly on the quality of the prompt used to steer the model, and most effective prompts have been handcrafted by humans. Inspired by classical program synthesis and the human approach to prompt engineering, we propose Automatic Prompt Engineer 1 (APE) for automatic instruction generation and selection. In our method, we treat the instruction as the ‚Äúprogram,‚Äù optimized by searching over a pool of instruction candidates proposed by an LLM in order to maximize a chosen score function. To evaluate the quality of the selected instruction, we evaluate the zero-shot performance of another LLM following the selected instruction. Extensive experiments show that our automatically generated instructions outperform the prior LLM baseline by a large margin and achieve better or comparable performance to the instructions generated by human annotators on 24/24 Instruction Induction tasks and 17/21 curated BIG-Bench tasks. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative analyses to explore the performance of APE. We show that APE-engineered prompts are able to improve few-shot learning performance (by simply prepending them to standard in-context learning prompts), Ô¨Ånd better zero-shot chain-of- thought prompts, as well as steer models toward truthfulness and/or informativeness. 2 1 I NTRODUCTION The combination of scale and attention-based architectures has resulted in language models possessing an unprecedented level of generality (Kaplan et al., 2020; Vaswani et al., 2017). These so-called ‚Äúlarge language models‚Äù (LLMs) have shown remarkable, often superhuman, capabilities across a diverse range of tasks, including both zero-shot and few-shot setups (Brown et al., 2020; Srivastava et al., 2022). With generality, however, there comes a question of control: how can we make LLMs do what we want them to do? To answer this question and steer LLMs toward desired behaviors, recent work has considered Ô¨Åne-tuning (Ouyang et al., 2022; Ziegler et al., 2019), in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020), and several forms of prompt generation (Gao, 2021), including both differentiable tuning of soft prompts (Qin & Eisner, 2021; Lester et al., 2021) and natural language prompt engineering (Reynolds & McDonell, 2021). The latter is of particular interest, as it provides a natural interface for humans to communicate with machines and may be of great relevance not only to LLMs but to other generalist models such as prompted image synthesizers (Rombach et al., 2022; Ramesh et al., 2022), for which public interest in prompt design and generation has also emerged (see Appendix A for examples). Behind this interest is the fact that plain language prompts do not always produce the desired results, even when those results are possible to produce with alternative instructions. Thus, human users must experiment with a wide range of prompts to elicit desired behaviors, as they have little knowledge of how compatible instructions are with a particular model. We can understand this by viewing LLMs as black-box computers that execute programs speciÔ¨Åed by natural language instructions: while they 1We deÔ¨Åne ‚Äúprompt engineering‚Äù as optimizing the language in a prompt in order to elicit the best possible performance. Notably, this does not include prompts that chain multiple LLM queries together or give the LLM access to external tools. 2 Our code is available at https://github.com/keirp/automatic_prompt_engineer. 1 arXiv:2211.01910v2  [cs.LG]  10 Mar 2023Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Professor Smith was given the following instructions: <INSERT>  Here are the Professor‚Äôs responses:  # Demostration Start  Input: prove   Output: disprove  Input: on    Output: off  ... # Demostration End   LLMs as Inference Models Instruction: write the antonym of the word.

(b) As measured by the interquartile mean across the 24 NLP tasks introduced by Honovich et al. (2022), APE is able to surpass human performance when using the InstructGPT model (Ouyang et al., 2022). can execute a broad range of natural language programs, the way these programs are processed may not be intuitive for humans, and the quality of instruction can only be measured when executing these instructions on a downstream task (Sanh et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2021). To reduce the human effort involved in creating and validating effective instructions, we propose a novel algorithm using LLMs to generate and select instructions automatically. We call this problem natural language program synthesis and propose to address it as a black-box optimization problem using LLMs to generate and search over heuristically viable candidate solutions. In doing so, we leverage the generalist capabilities of LLMs in three ways. First, we use an LLM as an inference model (Ellis et al., 2021; Honovich et al., 2022) to generate instruction candidates based on a small set of demonstrations in the form of input-output pairs. Next, we guide the search process by computing a score for each instruction under the LLM we seek to control. Finally, we propose an iterative Monte Carlo search method where LLMs improve the best candidates by proposing semantically similar instruction variants. Intuitively, our algorithm asks LLMs to generate a set of instruction candidates based on demonstrations and then asks them to assess which instructions are more promising. We call our algorithm Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE). Our main contributions are: ‚Ä¢ We frame instruction generation as natural language program synthesis, formulate it as a black-box optimization problem guided by LLMs, and propose both a naive and an iterative Monte Carlo search methods to approximate the solution. ‚Ä¢ Our proposed method, APE, achieves human-level performance on zero-shot learning with model-generated instructions on 24/24 Instruction Induction and 17/21 Big-Bench tasks. ‚Ä¢ We provide extensive qualitative and quantitative analyses exploring various facets of APE, and demonstrate applications of APE for improving few-shot learning, Ô¨Ånding better zero-shot chain of thought prompts, and steering LLMs toward desired behaviors such as truthfulness and/or informativeness. 2 R ELATED WORK Large Language Models Scaling up transformer-based language models in terms of model size, training data, and training compute has been shown to predictably improve performance on a wide range of downstream NLP tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2020). Many emergent abilities (Wei et al., 2022a) of LLMs have been discovered as a result of this scaling, including few-shot in-context learning, zero-shot problem solving, chain of thought reasoning, instruction following, and instruction induction (Cobbe et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2022b; Kojima et al., 2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 2022; Sanh et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022; Honovich et al., 2022). In this paper, we view LLMs as black-box computers that execute programs speciÔ¨Åed by natural language instructions and investigate how to control an LLM‚Äôs behavior using model-generated instructions. Prompt Engineering Prompting offers a natural and intuitive interface for humans to interact with and use generalist models such as LLMs. Due to its Ô¨Çexibility, prompting has been widely used as a generic method for NLP tasks (Schick & Sch√ºtze, 2021; Brown et al., 2020; Sanh et al., 2022). However, LLMs require careful prompt engineering, either manually (Reynolds & McDonell, 2021) or automatically (Gao et al., 2021; Shin et al., 2020), as models do not seem to understand the prompts in the same way a human would (Webson & Pavlick, 2021; Lu et al., 2021). Though many successful prompt tuning methods perform optimization over a continuous space using gradient-based methods (Liu et al., 2021; Qin & Eisner, 2021; Lester et al., 2021), this becomes less practical with scale, as computing gradients becomes increasingly expensive and access to models shifts to APIs that may not provide gradient access. In our paper, we borrow components from discrete prompt search methods, such as prompt generation (Gao et al., 2021; Ben-David et al., 2021), prompt scoring (Davison et al., 2019) and prompt paraphrasing (Jiang et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2021) to optimize instructions by searching directly in the natural language hypothesis space. As compared to this past work, which uses specialized models for each component and leans heavily on human templates, we show that the entire search can be conducted by a single LLM. Program Synthesis Program synthesis involves the automatic search over a ‚Äúprogram space‚Äù to Ô¨Ånd a program satisfying a particular speciÔ¨Åcation (Gulwani et al., 2017). Modern program synthesis admits a wide variety of speciÔ¨Åcations, including input-output examples (Ellis et al., 2021; Wong et al., 2021) and natural language (Jain et al., 2022). The range of feasible program spaces to search over has also grown, from historically restrictive domain-speciÔ¨Åc languages to general-purpose programming languages (Austin et al., 2021). In contrast to prior approaches that require a suitable structured hypothesis space and library of components (Liang et al., 2010; Ellis et al., 2018), we leverage the structure provided by LLMs to search over the space of natural language programs. Using inference models is a standard practice to speed up the search by restricting the search space to a limited space of possible expressions (Menon et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2017; Ellis et al., 2021). Inspired by this, we use LLMs as approximate inference models to generate program candidates based on a small set of demonstrations. Unlike classical program synthesis, our inference models do not require any training and generalize well to various tasks. 3 N ATURAL LANGUAGE PROGRAM SYNTHESIS USING LLM S We consider a task speciÔ¨Åed by a dataset Dtrain = {(Q,A)} of input/output demonstrations sampled from population X, and a prompted model M. The goal of natural language program synthesis is to Ô¨Ånd a single instruction œÅsuch that, when M is prompted with the concatenation [œÅ; Q] of instruction and a given input, M produces the corresponding output A. More formally, we frame this as an optimization problem, where we seek instruction œÅthat maximizes the expectation of some per-sample score f(œÅ,Q,A ) over possible (Q,A): œÅ‚ãÜ = arg max œÅ f(œÅ) = arg max œÅ E(Q,A) [f(œÅ,Q,A )] (1) Note that in general, Qmay be the empty string, such that we are optimizing œÅas a prompt that directly produces outputs {A}. While this task has been widely attempted by humans, we have little knowledge of how compatible any particular instruction is with model M. Thus, we propose to treat this human-intractable question as a black-box optimization process guided by LLMs. Our algorithm, APE, uses LLMs in each of two key components, proposal and scoring. As shown in Figure 1 and summarized in Algorithm 1, APE Ô¨Årst proposes a few candidate prompts, and then Ô¨Ålters/reÔ¨Ånes the candidate set according to a chosen score function, ultimately choosing the instruction with the highest score. We discuss options for proposal and scoring next. 3.1 I NITIAL PROPOSAL DISTRIBUTIONS Due to the inÔ¨Ånitely large search space, Ô¨Ånding the right instruction can be extremely difÔ¨Åcult, which has rendered natural language program synthesis historically intractable. Recent progress in NLP has shown language models are very good at generating diverse natural language text. Therefore, we 3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Algorithm 1 Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE) Require: Dtrain ‚Üê{(Q,A)}n: training examples, f : œÅ√óD‚Ü¶‚Üí R: score function 1: Use LLM to sample instruction proposals U‚Üê{ œÅ1,...,œÅ m}.

While random samples from LLMs are unlikely to produce the desired (Q,A) pairs, we can instead ask the LLM to approximately infer the most likely instructions with a high score, given the input/output demonstrations; i.e., to approximately sample from P(œÅ| Dtrain, f(œÅ) is high). I gave a friend an instruction and five inputs. The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs.

Template for TruthfulQA Figure 2: Prompts for LLMs Forward Mode Generation We consider two approaches to gen- erate high-quality candidates from P(œÅ| Dtrain, f(œÅ) is high). First, we adopt an approach based on ‚Äúforward‚Äù mode generation by trans- lating this distribution P(œÅ| Dtrain, f(œÅ) is high) into words. For example, in our instruction induction experiments (Subsection 4.1), we follow Honovich et al. (2022) and prompt the LLM using Figure 2 (Top). Reverse Mode Generation Although the ‚Äúforward‚Äù model works out of the box for most of the pretrained LLMs, translating P(œÅ| Dtrain, f(œÅ) is high) into words requires custom engineering across different tasks. This is because while instructions are typi- cally found in the beginning of passages, the ‚Äúforward‚Äù model only generates text from left to right, which requires the instruction to be predicted at the end of the prompt. Therefore, we desire a more Ô¨Çex- ible approach such that the instruction can be anywhere in the text. To address this, we consider ‚Äúreverse‚Äù mode generation, which uses an LLM with inÔ¨Ålling capabilities‚Äîe.g., T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), GLM (Du et al., 2022), and InsertGPT (Bavarian et al., 2022)‚Äîto infer the missing instructions. Our ‚Äúreverse‚Äù model directly samples from P(œÅ| Dtrain, f(œÅ) is high) by Ô¨Ålling in the blank. We show an example of the such template in Figure 2 (Middle). Customized Prompts Note that depending on the score function being used, there may exist more appropriate prompts than the sam- ples above. For example, in our TruthfulQA experiments, we start with the human-designed instructions from the original dataset (Lin et al., 2022) and ask the the ‚Äúreverse‚Äù model to propose initial in- struction samples that Ô¨Åt the missing context (Figure 2 (Bottom)). 3.2 S CORE FUNCTIONS To cast our problem as black-box optimization, we choose a score function that accurately measures the alignment between the dataset and the data the model generates. In our instruction induction experiments, we consider two potential score functions, described below. In the TruthfulQA ex- periments, we focused primarily on automated metrics proposed in Lin et al. (2022), similar to the execution accuracy. In each case, we evaluate the quality of a generated instruction using Equation (1), and take the expectation over a held-out test dataset Dtest. Execution accuracy First, we consider evaluating the quality of an instructionœÅusing the execution accuracy metric proposed by Honovich et al. (2022), which we denote as fexec. In most cases, 4Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 execution accuracy is simply deÔ¨Åned as the 0-1 loss, f(œÅ,Q,A ) = 1 [M([œÅ; Q]) =A]. On some tasks, execution accuracy takes into account invariants; e.g., it may be an order invariant set matching loss, as described in Appendix A of Honovich et al. (2022). Log probability We further consider a softer probabilistic score function, which we hypothesize might improve optimization by providing a more Ô¨Åne-grained signal when searching over low-quality instruction candidates. In particular, we consider the log probability of the desired answer given the instruction and question under the target model M, which on a per sample basis, is log P(A| [œÅ; Q]). EfÔ¨Åcient score estimation Estimating the score by computing the score over the entire training dataset for all instruction candidates can be expensive. To reduce the computation cost, we adopt a Ô¨Åltering scheme where a promising candidate receives more computation resources while a low- quality candidate receives less computation. It can be achieved by using a multi-stage computation strategy on lines 2-9 Algorithm 1. We Ô¨Årst evaluate all candidates with a small subset of the training dataset. For the candidates with a score greater than a certain threshold, we sample and evaluate a new non-overlapping subset from the training dataset to update the moving average of the score. Then, we repeat this process until a small set of candidates is left, which are evaluated on the entire training dataset. This adaptive Ô¨Åltering scheme signiÔ¨Åcantly improves the computation efÔ¨Åciency by keeping the exact computation costs for the high-quality samples and drastically reducing the computation costs for low-quality candidates. We note that a similar score estimation scheme has been used in previous works (Li et al., 2022; Maclaurin & Adams, 2015). 3.3 I TERATIVE PROPOSAL DISTRIBUTIONS Despite our attempt to directly sample high-quality initial instruction candidates, it could be the case that the method described in Subsection 3.1 fails to produce a good proposal set U, either because it lacks of diversity or does not contain any candidates with a suitably high score. In case of such challenges, we explore an iterative process for resampling U. Generate a variation of the following instruction while keeping the semantic meaning. Input: [INSTRUCTION] Output: <COMPLETE>  Prompt for Resampling Figure 3: Resampling Iterative Monte Carlo Search Instead of only sampling from the initial proposal, we consider exploring the search space locally around the current best candidates. This allows us to generate new instructions that are more likely to be successful. We call this variant iterative APE. At each stage, we evaluate a set of instructions and Ô¨Ålter out candidates with low scores. Then, an LLM is asked to generate new instructions similar to those with high scores. We provide the prompt used for resampling in Figure 3. Figure 6 (Right) shows that although this approach improves the overall quality of the proposal set U, the highest scoring instruction tends to remain the same with more stages. We conclude iterative generation provides marginal improvement over the relative simplicity and effectiveness of the generative process described in Subsection 3.1. Therefore, we use APE without iterative search as default unless otherwise stated. 4 L ARGE LANGUAGE MODELS ARE HUMAN -LEVEL PROMPT ENGINEERS This section examines how APE can guide LLMs to desired behaviors. We investigate from four perspectives: zero-shot performance, few-shot in-context learning performance, zero-shot chain-of- thought reasoning, and truthfulness. Our experiments show that APE can Ô¨Ånd prompts that improve task performance, performing equal to or even better than those authored by humans. APE also often produces insightful tricks for how to best prompt language models that can be successfully transferred to new tasks (see Section 4.3). 4.1 I NSTRUCTION INDUCTION We assess the effectiveness of zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning on 24 instruction induction tasks proposed in Honovich et al. (2022). The tasks span many facets of language understanding, from simple phrase structure to similarity and causality identiÔ¨Åcation. We provide a detailed descriptions of each task in Appendix B. For each task, we sample Ô¨Åve input-output pairs from the training data and select the best instruction using algorithm 1. Then, we evaluate the quality of the instruction 5Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Antonyms Cause Selection Common Concept Diff First Letter Formality Large Animal List Letters 0 1 Membership Negation Number to Word Passivization Pluralization Rhymes Second Letter Sentence Similarity 0 1 Sentiment Starting With Sum Synonyms Translation en-de Translation en-es Translation en-fr Word in Context 0 1 Execution Accuracy Greedy Human APE Figure 4: Zero-shot test accuracy on 24 Instruction Induction tasks. APE achieves human-level or better performance on all 24 out of 24 tasks. by executing the instruction on InstructGPT 3. We repeat our experiments Ô¨Åve times with different random seeds to report the mean and standard deviation. The exact templates for our experiments can be found in Appendix (Table 5). Zero-shot Learning We compare our method against two baselines: human prompt engineers (Human)4 and the model-generated instruction algorithm proposed by Honovich et al. (2022). This algorithm can be thought of as a greedy version of APE, without a search and selection process; thus, we refer to it as ‚ÄúGreedy‚Äù. Figure 4 shows the zero-shot performance of InstructGPT using human instructions and model generated instructions. Our algorithm outperforms ‚ÄúGreedy‚Äù on every task and achieves equal or better than human performance on 24 of 24 tasks. Moreover, the Interquartile Mean (IQM) (Agarwal et al., 2021) across all 24 tasks in Figure 1 suggests that APE with InstructGPT outperforms human-engineered prompts, obtaining an IQM of 0.810 vs humans‚Äô 0.749. We summarize the instruction selected by APE for each task in Appendix (Table 12). Few-shot In-context Learning We evaluated APE-generated instructions in few-shot in-context learning, where we insert the instruction before the in-context demonstrations. Those instructions are selected based on zero-shot execution accuracy, and we denote this setting as ‚ÄúInstruction + In-context‚Äù in Figure 8. As shown in Figure 8, adding an instruction achieves a comparable or better test performance than the standard in-context learning performance on 21 of 24 tasks. Counter- intuitively, adding in-context examples for Rhymes, Large Animal, and Second Letters hurts model performance. We conjecture that it may be because the selected instructions overÔ¨Åt the zero-shot learning scenario and thus do not perform well on the few-shot case. Therefore, we experiment using few-shot execution accuracy as the selection metric. Figure 14 shows that the few-shot metric achieves comparable or slightly better than the zero-shot metric except for Rhymes. To have an intuitive understanding of what is happening, we provide a qualitative analysis in Appendix C.1. 4.2 B IGBENCH To see whether APE can be applied to more challenging tasks, we propose and curate BIG-Bench Instruction Induction (BBII), a clean and tractable subset of 21 tasks that have a clear, human-written instruction that can be applied to all examples in the dataset. The selected tasks cover many facets of language understanding and includes all nine such problems from the BigBench-Hard Subset (Suzgun et al., 2022). In particular, it includes emotional understanding, context-free question answering, reading comprehension, summarization, algorithms, and various reasoning tasks (e.g., arithmetic, commonsense, symbolic, and other logical reasoning tasks). We provide a detailed description of the task and our selection criteria in Appendix B. 3We use the text-davinci-002 via the OpenAI API (https://beta.openai.com/). Though not stated explicitly in the API, we assume the models are those reported by Ouyang et al. (2022). 4We use the gold annotations from Honovich et al. (2022), which were manually veriÔ¨Åed for correctness. 6Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 For each task, we used the reverse mode generation of InstructGPT to generate a set of instruction candidates and ranked the instructions based on their execution accuracy. Then, we executed the selected instruction on InstructGPT to compute the zero-shot performance on the test set and compared it with the default human prompt. As shown in Appendix Table 6, APE achieves comparable or better performance than the default human prompt on 17 out of 21 tasks. 4.3 Z ERO -SHOT CHAIN OF THOUGHT Chain-of-thought reasoning has been shown to dramatically improve the ability of LLMs to complete complex reasoning tasks, such as solving math problems that require multiple steps. Early works (Nye et al., 2021; Betz et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2022b) on chain-of-thought used Ô¨Åne-tuning or in-context learning to get LLMs to show their work for such problems. One of the most inÔ¨Çuential recent works of prompt engineering was the discovery (Kojima et al., 2022) that LLMs could be made to give chain-of-thoughts simply by prepending ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think step by step.‚Äù to the beginning of the LLM‚Äôs response. Known as Zero-Shot-CoT, this prompting strategy improves the zero-shot performance of InstructGPT on MultiArith (Roy & Roth, 2016) from 17.7 to 78.7 and improves performance on GSM8K(Cobbe et al., 2021) from 10.4 to 40.7. As shown in Table 7, Kojima et al. (2022) found their prompt was the best performing out of at least nine human-designed prompts. We used APE to automatically search for the best answer-preÔ¨Åx across the suite of tasks used in Kojima et al. (2022). Our approach to optimizing this prompt was inspired by Zelikman et al. (2022). First, we generate a dataset of questions and reasoning steps generated using InstructGPT with ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think step by step.‚Äù Then, we remove any data points that had incorrect answers. Finally, we use APE to Ô¨Ånd a prompt starting with ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs‚Äù that maximizes the likelihood of these correct reasoning steps. See Table 5 for the template used for prompt generation and evaluation. APE produces the prompt ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.‚Äù This generated prompt further improves performance from 78.7 to 82.0 on MultiArith and from 40.7 to 43.0 on GSM8K. We believe this general workÔ¨Çow represents a common use-case for APE where prompt engineers use APE to optimize parts of their exiting templates to improve performance. See Figure 10 for details on the performance of this prompt on other reasoning tasks. 4.4 T RUTHFUL QA We apply our method on TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022) to see how APE-generated instructions can steer an LLM to generate answers with different styles, and study the trade-off between truthfulness and informativeness. Borrowing the metrics from the original paper, we use APE to the learn instructions that maximize three metrics: truthfulness (% True), informativeness (% Info), and a combination of both (%True + %Info). Lin et al. (2022) used human evaluation to assess the model performance, but they found their automated metrics align with human prediction over 90% of the time. In our experiments, we rely on their Ô¨Åne-tuned GPT-judge and GPT-info to evaluate the scores. Prompt Engineering in TruthfulQA We want to stress that the TruthfulQA dataset is intended to test pretrained models in zero-shot settings. Our results are not in any way compatible with the original benchmarks. Because we have optimized the instructions using a small portion of the question and answer pairs as training demonstrations, our results are not ‚Äútrue few-shot learning‚Äù (Perez et al., 2021). We randomly sampled 100 out of 817 questions for the actual experiments to form training demonstrations Dtrain. To sample the proposal setU, we ask a ‚Äúreverse‚Äù model to generate instructions based on six randomly chosen demonstration pairs, similar to our previous experiments. Unlike in Instruction Induction, in TruthfulQA, we aim to Ô¨Ånd a single best instruction prompt that works well across all 38 categories of questions spanning health, law, politics, and Ô¨Åction. It is worth noting all our generated instructions are very generic, e.g., ‚ÄúYou will be asked a series of questions. For each question, you must either answer the question or decline to answer, in which case you must state that you have no comment‚Äù, and do not contain any examples from the dataset. Truthfulness vs Informativeness Trade-off We found that APE outperforms the human- engineered prompt with only 200 candidates proposed by InstructGPT (175B), as seen in Figure 5. We compared our generated prompt with the ‚Äúhelp‚Äù prompt from Lin et al. (2022). The training and test performance are shown in Figure 5(a)-(b). We found that choosing the top 10 of 200 candidates on the training set generalizes well to the test set. We report the average performance across the top 10 instructions for the three metrics. This result by itself is not surprising as the human baseline is 7Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 % True (GPT-judge)% Info (GPT-info) % True + % Info 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8Metric Value (%) Human APE (a) Average performance Train % True (GPT-judge)% Info (GPT-info) % True + % Info 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8Metric Value (%) Human APE (b) Average performance Test 0.60 0.65 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 % True (GPT-judge) 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8% Informative (GPT-info) Truth Info Truth+Info Human (c) %True-%Info trade-off Training 0.60 0.65 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 % True (GPT-judge) 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8% Informative (GPT-info) Truth Info Truth+Info Human (d) %True-%Info trade-off Test Figure 5: Comparison of APE and ‚Äúhelp‚Äù (human) prompt on the TruthfulQA task.

However, we found that the instructions discovered by APE can achieve very high truthfulness with answers such as ‚ÄúNo comment,‚Äù but these answers provide little information. We used our top candidates to further investigate the trade-off between truthfulness and informativeness. We visualize the top 10 proposed samples across the three metrics on the truthfulness-informative plots shown in Figure 5(c) and Figure 5(d). While APE achieves over 40% accuracy in providing both true and informative answers (v.s. 30% by the ‚Äúhelp‚Äù prompt from humans), the instructions discovered tend to target the two ends of this %true-%info Pareto frontier. 5 Q UANTITATIVE ANALYSIS In this section, we conduct quantitative analyses to better understand the three main components of our method: proposal distribution, score functions, and iterative search. Moreover, we conduct a cost analysis in the Appendix D to understand the most cost-efÔ¨Åcient way to Ô¨Ånd the best prompt. We observe the larger and more powerful language models are more cost-effective for generating the best prompt despite a higher per-token cost. 5.1 LLM S FOR PROPOSAL DISTRIBUTION How does the proposal quality change as we increase the model size? To understand how the model size affects the quality of the initial proposal distribution, we examine eight different models5 available via the OpenAI API. To assess the quality of the proposal distribution, we generate 250 instructions per model and compute the execution accuracy on 50 test data points. We visualize the survival function (percentage of instructions with test accuracy greater than a certain threshold) and the histogram of test accuracy for a simple task (i.e., Pluralization) in Figure 6 (a) and include a similar plot for a more challenging task (Start With) in the Appendix (Figure 28). As shown in both Ô¨Ågures (and unsurprisingly), larger models tend to produce better proposal distributions than smaller ones, as do the models that were Ô¨Åne-tuned to follow human instructions. On the simple task, all instructions generated by the best model, InstructGPT (175B), have reasonable test accuracy. In contrast, half of the instructions are off-topic and perform poorly on the more challenging task. 5.2 LLM S FOR SELECTION Does proposal quality matter under selection? If we sample more instructions from the LLMs, then it becomes more likely for us to Ô¨Ånd better instructions. To verify this hypothesis, we increase the sample size from 4 to 128 and evaluate the test accuracy change. Figure 7 (Left) shows a monotonically increasing trend with a diminishing return, as human-level performance is achieved with 64 instruction samples. Thus, we choose 50 as our default sample size. Under this conÔ¨Åguration, we investigate how the proposal distribution affects the test accuracy of the best instruction selected by our algorithm. Figure 1(b) shows that though the small models may be less likely to generate good instructions, they nonetheless generate some good ones if we sample enough candidates. Therefore, 5We use ada, babbage, curie, davinci, text-ada-001, text-babbage-001, text-curie-001, text-davanci-002 8Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Test accuracy ( ) 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0% instructions with accuracy >  0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Test accuracy ( ) 100 101 102 Count GPT-3 (350M) GPT-3 (1.3B) GPT-3 (6.7B) GPT-3 (175B) InstructGPT (350M) InstructGPT (1.3B) InstructGPT (6.7B) InstructGPT (175B) 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Train accuracy ( ) 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0% instructions with accuracy >  0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Train accuracy ( ) 100 101 102 Count Start 1 2 3 4 5 Figure 6: (Left) Quality of the proposal distribution of models with different size as assessed by test execution accuracy.

(Right) Test execution accuracy of the best instruction selected using APE and iterative APE (APE (IT)). we still Ô¨Ånd promising instructions with a small model by running our selection algorithm, explaining why our method outperforms the greedy approach Honovich et al. (2022) across all eight models. Which scoring function is better? We compute the correlation between the test accuracy and two metrics on 24 instruction induction tasks to study how good our proposed metrics are. We generate 250 instructions per task using InstructGPT (175B) in ‚Äúforward‚Äù mode and compute the metric score and test accuracy on 10 test data points. We visualize the Spearman correlation between the test accuracy and two metrics. Figure 7 (Middle) shows that the execution accuracy aligns better with the test performance across the tasks. Thus, we choose it as our default metric unless otherwise stated. 5.3 I TERATIVE MONTE CARLO SEARCH Does Iterative Search improve the instruction quality? We visualize the survival function and histogram of test accuracy on the ‚ÄúPassivization‚Äù task in Figure 6 (Right) and include Ô¨Åve more tasks in the Appendix. The survival plot shows that the curves increase as the round goes up, which suggests that iterative search does result in a higher-quality proposal set. However, we observe diminishing returns to further selection rounds as the quality seems to stabilize after three rounds. Do we need Iterative Search? We compare APE and iterative APE on six tasks6. As shown in Figure 7, the iterative search marginally improves performance on tasks where APE underperforms humans but achieves similar performance on the other tasks. This is consistent with our hypothesis that iterative search would be most useful on tasks where generating a good initial U is challenging. 6 C ONCLUSION Large language models can be seen as general-purpose computers that execute programs speciÔ¨Åed by natural language prompts. We automate the prompt engineering process by formulating it as a black-box optimization problem, which we propose to solve using efÔ¨Åcient search algorithms guided by LLMs. Our method achieves human-level performance on various tasks with minimum human inputs. As recent LLMs demonstrate an impressive ability to follow human instruction, we expect many future models, including those for formal program synthesis, to have a natural language interface. This work builds the foundation to control and steer generative artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence. 9Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to thank Or Honovich and Michael Zhang for their help and valuable feedback.

Those instructions are selected based on zero-shot execution accuracy, and we denote this setting as ‚ÄúInstruc- tion + In-context‚Äù in Figure 8. As shown in Figure 8, adding an instruction achieves a comparable or better test performance than the standard in-context learning performance on 21 of 24 tasks. Counter-intuitively, adding in-context examples for Rhymes, Large Animal, and Second Letters hurts model performance. We conjecture that it may be because the selected instructions overÔ¨Åt the zero-shot learning scenario and thus do not perform well on the few-shot case. Therefore, we experiment using few-shot execution accuracy as the selection metric. Figure 14 shows that the few-shot metric achieves comparable or slightly better than the zero-shot metric except for Rhymes. To have an intuitive understanding of what is happening, we provide a qualitative analysis below. Few-shot Qualitative Analysis We Ô¨Ånd an adversarial case on Rhymes when combining the instruction and in-context prompts. Table 8 shows that 4 of 5 Ô¨Åltered instructions ask to echo the input word. These proposals effectively hack the evaluation with near-perfect test accuracy, as every word rhymes with itself. However, adding in-context examples for these instructions creates a misalignment between instruction (induces trivial rhymes) and context (induces non-trivial rhymes), resulting in a signiÔ¨Åcant drop in performance. If we instead score the instructions based on the few-shot metric, this performance drop can be alleviated since the model can choose a more aligned instruction.

When compared to human prompts, APE-generated prompts improve or match zero-shot performance on 17 out of 21 tasks. We report the normalized preferred metric deÔ¨Åned in Srivastava et al. (2022). Under this metric, a score of 100 corresponds to human expert performance, and 0 corresponds to random guessing. Note that a model can achieve a score less than 0 if it performs worse than random guessing on a multiple-choice task. causal_judgment disambiguation_qa dyck_language epistemic_reasoning gender_inclusive implicatures linguistics_puzzles logical_fallacy_detectionmovie_recommendation navigate object_counting operators presuppositions_as_nli question_selection ruin_names snarks sports_understanding tense winowhy word_sorting word_unscrambling 20 0 20 40 60 80 Normalized Performance Human APE Figure 9: APE improves or matches normalized zero-shot performance on 17 out of 21 BIG-Bench Instruction Induction tasks.

(2022). APE Ô¨Ånds a general prompt \"Let‚Äôs work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.\" which is able to improve text-davinci-002‚Äôs zero-shot-CoT performance on MultiArith Roy & Roth (2016) from 78.7 to 82.0 and GSM8K Cobbe et al. (2021) 40.7 to 43.0 compared to the original CoT prompt. We include full results on 12 tasks with this new APE CoT prompt in Figure 10. Figure 10: The performance of APE discovered prompt \"Let‚Äôs work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.\" on the 12 tasks from Kojima et al. (2022). We collect a CoT dataset from the original paper and Ô¨Ålter out incorrect answers. We then use APE to optimize the CoT prompt. We improve performance on 6/12 tasks and nearly match human performance on 4/12 tasks. We hypothesize ShufÔ¨Çed Objects and Last Letter are hard to optimize on with a general prompt.

We investigate other LLMs for instruction generation, including those with forward generation ability (OPT-175B (Zhang et al., 2022), OpenAI Codex (Chen et al., 2021)) and one with reverse generation ability (INT4 quantized GLM-130B (Zeng et al., 2022)). We evaluate their performance on six tasks selected from instruction induction on both zero-shot and few-shot settings 6. Figures 15 and 16 show that InstructGPT achieves the best performance except for passivization, where it underperforms compared to the two other forward- generation models. Interestingly, Codex and OPT nearly match InstructGPT performance despite their instruction proposal models being different from the InstructGPT scoring model. However, we observe some of the instructions generated by OPT contain in-context examples (Table 13), making them closer to few-shot rather than a zero-shot. In contrast, GLM achieves the poorest zero-shot performance as its inÔ¨Ålling capabilities are trained to generate very short text, as shown in Table 15. How important is the meta prompt? In our experiments, we observe that the meta prompt for instruction generation can substantially inÔ¨Çuences the distribution of proposed instructions. To investigate how it can affect the Ô¨Ånal performance, we experiment with our TruthfulQA template instead of the reverse generation template (Figures 21, 22). We Ô¨Ånd the meta prompt template makes a difference, improving the performance on some tasks while impairing others. Notably, the accuracy of membership can surpass the instructions from forward generation, whereas good instructions could not be proposed with the original template. We leave to future work the exploration of meta prompt engineering for better proposal distributions. How transferable are the generated instructions? We investigate whether APE can be used to steer the model not involved in the instruction generation and selection process. As shown in Figure 17, there is a signiÔ¨Åcant performance drop when we use the instructions from InstructGPT to steer the GPT-3 model, and vice versa. This performance drop can be mitigated by a human written instruction. It suggests that the alignment between the scoring model and execution model is crucial, and the instructions generated by InstructGPT work best for the InstructGPT itself but do not transfer well to a different model like GPT-3. In contrast, GPT-3-generated instructions can steer GPT-3 exceptionally well, outperforming the InstructGPT instructions and human instructions by a large margin. Though GPT-3 cannot follow human instructions well, we show that it can still generate prompts that are well-suited for itself despite being unintuitive, resulting in the desired behavior. We provide the generated prompts in Table 16. 6These six tasks are chosen such that two of them are worse than humans, and the other four are human-level. They cover six categories (spelling, morphosyntax, lexical semantics, semantics, multi-lingual, and GLUE). 23Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 D C OST ANALYSIS More powerful models are cost-efÔ¨Åcient for instruction proposal Despite higher per-token costs, we Ô¨Ånd larger, human-aligned models (models trained to follow human instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022)) dominate the accuracy-cost frontier of APE (Figure 11). Compared to smaller models not Ô¨Åned-tuned with human instructions, they tend to generate more concise instructions (Figure 12), signiÔ¨Åcantly reducing the cost of APE scoring. Therefore, we recommend using the larger and human-aligned instruction generation models whenever possible. APE instructions are context condensers Although zero-shot instructions require more extensive sampling and scoring ofÔ¨Çine than in-context learning, they are token-efÔ¨Åcient when amortized over a large number of inferences. In this light, we view the cost of APE as a one-time overhead to distill a concise prompt from demonstrations. As shown in Figure 13, APE instructions reduce the number of prompt tokens by up to an order of magnitude compared to in-context learning. Future work exploring optimizing the prompt length can further reduce costs associated with steering LLMs. Figure 11: The accuracy-cost frontier of APE across eight OpenAI models. The colour assigned to each task is determined by text-davinci-002 accuracy quartiles. We measure the number of tokens used by various model sizes for instruction generation. We also measure the number of tokens used to score 250 generated instructions on ten validation input-output pairs on InstructGPT (i.e., text-davinci-002). We calculated the total cost per task by multiplying and adding the number of tokens consumed by each model type with OpenAI‚Äôs API rate as of September 1, 2022 (USD/1000 tokens: ada ‚Äì 0.0004, babbage ‚Äì 0.0005, curie ‚Äì 0.0020, davinci ‚Äì 0.0200). Counter-intuitively, smaller models are more expensive. This is because the most signiÔ¨Åcant proportion of the cost is scoring with InstructGPT, which scales with the length of instructions generated. Smaller models not trained with human instructions tend to generate longer instructions, reaching the maximum limit of predeÔ¨Åned 50 tokens. Larger models trained with human instructions are most cost-efÔ¨Åcient as instruction generators as they signiÔ¨Åcantly reduce scoring costs with shorter instructions. 24Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Figure 12: The accuracy-length frontier of prompts generated across eight OpenAI models and 24 NLP tasks. Models not trained with human instructions tend to reach the predeÔ¨Åned maximum number of tokens we allow to be generated, while larger and more aligned LLMs output more concise instructions. The more capable LLMs dominate the frontier of instruction length and accuracy, which we view as a the ability to condense context into an instruction efÔ¨Åciently. Figure 13: Instructions found by APE from InstructGPT are token efÔ¨Åcient compared to using Ô¨Åve in-context examples. We observe that exemplary instructions are up to Ô¨Åve times more efÔ¨Åcient than in-context learning to achieve comparable performance. Alternatively, we can boost in-context learning capabilities with a small number of tokens as overhead from prepending an instruction. 25Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 E G ENERATED INSTRUCTIONS Table 8: APE selected Rhyme instructions with zero-shot and few-shot test performance.

Extensive analyses emphasize its capability to craft expert-level, de- tailed, and domain-insightful prompts with great efficiency and generalizability1. 1 I NTRODUCTION Prompt engineering aims to craft effective prompts for harnessing the full potential of large language models (LLMs). Recent automatic prompt engineering, i.e., prompt optimization, has successfully studied training soft prompts (Lester et al., 2021; Hu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022), or searching for optimal combinations of discrete tokens (Shin et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022), by utilizing internal states or gradients of LLMs. For cutting-edge, proprietary API-based LLMs like GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023b), prompt engineering largely relies on somewhat ad-hoc human- machine interactions. Human prompting experts thus need a unique blend of domain knowledge and intuition for LLMs to design the most effective prompts. For instance, an ideal prompt from human experts, shown in Figure 1, might integrate nuanced elements like task descriptions, domain knowledge, solution guidance, etc., all of which substantially boost prompt quality and performance. Automating expert-level prompting engineering on API-based LLMs presents significant challenges, largely due to the intricate nature of expert-level prompts, as illustrated in Figure 1. Although re- cent prompt optimization approaches have begun to utilize techniques like iterative sampling or ‚àóEqual contribution ‚Ä†Corresponding author 1Code and demo are available at: https://github.com/XinyuanWangCS/PromptAgent 1 arXiv:2310.16427v2  [cs.CL]  7 Dec 2023Ordinary User Prompt Expert-level Prompt Biomedical Task Input Extract the disease or condition from the sentence,  if any is mentioned.

(2022)). The task is in the biomedical domain for extracting disease entities (NCBI, DoÀògan et al. (2014)). The expert prompt provides much richer domain-specific details and structured guidance than the other two, leading to the correct prediction. evolutionary algorithms, such as Monte Carlo search (Zhou et al., 2022) or Gibbs sampling (Xu et al., 2023), they mostly employ heuristic methods like text edits or paraphrasing for generating candidate prompts (Zhou et al., 2022; Prasad et al., 2023). These approaches also often rely on straightforward iteration algorithms and lack a principled strategy to guide the exploration. Con- sequently, they tend to settle on local variants of prompts from ordinary users and rarely ascend to the excellence and nuances of expert-level prompts. Critically, many of these methods overlook that prompting engineering is essentially a human-in-the-loop application. In this process, humans refine prompts by fixing intermediate errors and integrating necessary domain knowledge through itera- tive interactions. This iterative refinement process characterizes the merits of how human experts craft superior prompts. Yet, the challenge remains that human exploration, while effective, can be expensive and less efficient at handling multiple errors simultaneously to explore the prompt space, thereby impeding the scalability of expert-level prompting.

To address the above challenges and combine human-like explo- ration with machine efficiency, we introduce PromptAgent in this paper. Drawing inspiration from human trial-and-error processes, PromptAgent seamlessly incorporates the principled planning ap- proach, specifically Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), to strategi- cally optimize the prompting process. Notably, PromptAgent refor- mulates prompt optimization as a strategic planning problem to ad- dress the complexity of expert-level prompt space. Under this plan- ning framework, it plays trial-and-error iteration to retrieve model errors and leverages the self-reflection ability of LLMs (Jang, 2023; Shinn et al., 2023; Pan et al., 2023) to generate insightful error feedback. This feedback, in turn, plays a critical role in effec- tively inducing domain knowledge and guiding towards in-depth prompts. Through strategic plan- ning, PromptAgent iteratively leverages insightful error feedback (action) to refine each version of prompts (state). Starting from an initial prompt (state), PromptAgent systematically grows the prompt space in a tree structure and prioritizes high-reward traces to navigate the vast space of expert-level prompts. The principled MCTS planning allows PromptAgent to look ahead and sim- ulate future rewards, which are then backpropagated to update the beliefs about the current prompt so that PromptAgent can explore more promising alternatives later. We demonstrate that PromptAgent can discover productive expert-level prompts by applying it to 12 tasks spanning three practical and distinct domains: BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) (Suzgun et al., 2022), as well as domain-specific and general NLP tasks. Starting with an initial human-written prompt and a small set of training samples, PromptAgent not only enhances the performance of the initial human prompt greatly but also significantly surpasses strong Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and recent prompt 2optimization baselines. For instance, Figure 2 shows PromptAgent consistently outperforms human and Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE) (Zhou et al., 2022) baselines across GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and PaLM 2, yielding improvements by 9.1%, 7.7% and 6% over APE, respectively. Extensive qualitative results further highlight the expert-level aspects of optimized prompts, indicating that PromptAgent effectively bridges the domain gap in challenging tasks, offering great exploration efficiency and generalizability. As we anticipate the emergence of even more powerful LLMs that can understand intricate instructions, we believe that expert-level prompting will spearhead the next era of prompt engineering, where PromptAgent stands as a pioneering step in this research direction. 2 R ELATED WORKS Prompt optimization. Automatically discovering optimal prompts has emerged as a central chal- lenge in the era of LLMs. For open-sourced LLMs, one can leverage their internal states or gradients to either train additional parameters, such as soft prompts (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022), or search for discrete prompts via gradient-based search (Shin et al., 2020; Wen et al., 2023) or reinforcement learning (Deng et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022). However, such methods are less feasible for closed-sourced LLMs, which urges people to study gradient-free prompt optimization, typically assuming only APIs and a limited training set are avail- able. Most gradient-free methods follow an iterative process of prompt sampling, i.e., starting from an initial prompt, they iteratively sample prompt candidates and score them to select the best one for the next iteration. Numerous methods emphasize diversifying the prompt candidates‚Äîexamples include edit-based methods like deleting or swapping phrases (Prasad et al., 2023), back transla- tion (Xu et al., 2022), evolutionary operations (Guo et al., 2023; Fernando et al., 2023), or more relevantly, LLM rewriting based on natural language feedback (Zhou et al., 2022; Pryzant et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023). There are also explorations into alternate sampling procedures like Monte Carlo search (Zhou et al., 2022), Gibbs sampling (Xu et al., 2023) or Beam search (Pryzant et al., 2023). Nevertheless, PromptAgent fundamentally differs from all the above methods in two ways. First, while primary search algorithms have been investigated (Zhou et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2023; Pryzant et al., 2023), we are the first to introduce strategic planning into prompting optimization research. This innovation provides a structured way to efficiently navigate the intricate space of prompts, with principled capabilities like lookahead and backtrack. Second, most previous methods generate prompt candidates as local variants, such as paraphrasing or LLM sampling, fail to incor- porate fine-grained domain insights. Instead, we formulate prompt generation as the state transition and strategically convert error feedback into new states, leading to expert-level prompts. Augmenting LLMs with self-reflection and planning. Despite their remarkable capabilities, mod- ern LLMs exhibit certain limitations, such as long-term coherence (Malkin et al., 2022), lacking an internal world model (Hao et al., 2023a), the inability to act in the real world, etc. Thus, augmenting LLMs with external modules like reasoning and tools has drawn extensive attention recently (Mialon et al., 2023; Ozturkler et al., 2022; Hao et al., 2023b; Jojic et al., 2023), of which two common strate- gies are relevant here: self-reflection and planning with LLMs. Self-reflection encourages the LLM to introspect, critique its outputs, and subsequently suggest more refined solutions (Jang, 2023; Pan et al., 2023). This has been leveraged to enhance a variety of applications, from complex computer tasks (Shinn et al., 2023), text generation (Welleck et al., 2022) to reasoning (Paul et al., 2023). Moreover, planning with LLMs sheds light on evaluating and enhancing these models. At its core, planning is an essential ability for intelligent agents to generate a sequence of actions in achiev- ing specific goals (McCarthy et al., 1963; Bylander, 1994). One line of research is to prompt and evaluate LLMs on planning tasks directly (Liu et al., 2023). For instance, translation-based ap- proaches translate natural language instructions into executable programs (e.g., Planning domain description language) to run classical planning algorithms. Another closer line of research is to aug- ment the strategic reasoning ability of LLMs with planning-based algorithms. For example, Tree of Thoughts (ToT) applies DFS/BFS to augment CoT prompting, while both CoRe (Zhu et al., 2022) and RAP (Hao et al., 2023a) utilize MCTS to navigate richer reasoning paths. Yet, in contrast to ex- isting endeavors in LLM augmentation, PromptAgent is the first novel framework for synergistically marrying the spirits of self-reflection and planning specifically tailored for prompt optimization. 3 M ETHODOLOGY Given a base LLM B and a target task T , the job at hand for a prompt engineer is to craft an op- timized natural language prompt PT that maximizes the performance of B on T .

The tree struc- ture enables strategic planning for PromptAgent. (b) A simplified state transition example. Given a current state (prompt), the base model ( gpt-3.5-turbo) collects errors from the task dataset. The optimizer model (gpt-4) provides error feedback accordingly. The optimized model then updates the prompt according to the feedback and transits to the next state. gap between novice and expert prompt engineers can be significant, particularly for tasks demand- ing specialized domain expertise, such as in the biomedical domain. Our primary objective is to autonomously refine the task prompt PT to bridge this knowledge gap, minimizing human inter- vention. Most existing approaches rely on sampling local prompt alternatives iteratively, which is not only resource-intensive but also lacks assurance of yielding an optimal final prompt. In light of this, we introduce PromptAgent, an agent-based framework to produce expert-level task prompts via strategic planning and reflecting with error feedback during the prompting process, striking a proper balance of exploration and performance. Problem formulation. Following a standard setting in prompt optimization (Zhou et al., 2022), we start with an initial natural language task prompt P0 (e.g., ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs solve this problem step-by-step‚Äù) and a small set of training samples from target task T as (Q, A) = {qi, ai}N i=1, where qi/ai are input/output pairs for each sample (e.g., a question and its answer). Given the model input consisting of P and qi, the base LLM B makes the prediction (typically through a left-to-right generation process) based on pB(ai|qi, P)2. The goal of prompt optimization is to find the optimal natural language prompt P‚àó that maximizes the performance towards a measure functionR (e.g., accuracy). This can be formally defined as an optimization problem: P‚àó = arg maxP‚ààS P i R(pB(ai|qi, P)), where S denotes the sample space for a natural language prompt, an infinite and intractable space, if not impossible, to comprehensively enumerate. Conventionally, human experts draw upon a blend of heuristics and domain-specific insights to craft such prompts. Although previous optimization methods have attempted to leverage iterative sampling methods for prompt discovery (Zhou et al., 2022), we advance this line of research by proposing a unified framework that seamlessly integrates strategic planning for superior, expert-level prompt optimization. Next, we introduce the formulation of PromptAgent and then present the planning-based prompt optimization. 3.1 P ROMPT AGENT FRAMEWORK DESIGN The goal of PromptAgent is to effectively integrate expert prior knowledge into the task prompt while ensuring an efficient and strategic exploration of the expansive prompt space. In this planning framework, we define the state as each iteration or version of the task prompt, st = Pt. This allows systematic monitoring of the evolution of prompts and directly applying refinements to modify them. Actions, in this context, can be thought of as potential modifications to the current prompt (state), such as word replacements or paraphrasing, as explored in prior works (Jiang et al., 2020; Prasad et al., 2023). However, a more desirable action space should introduce more effective and meaning- ful revisions that invoke prior expert knowledge, ultimately steering toward expert-level prompts. 2Note this is traditionally a zero-shot setting we focus on, where task prompt excludes any training samples. 4We thus propose error-based actions where each action is generated based on certain errors made by the base model. Specifically, as illustrated in Figure 3 (b), actions are framed as error feedbacks to guide subsequent refinements of the prompt. Such error feedbacks effectively suggest potential directions for correcting model errors, ensuring the revised prompt better instructs the base model to avoid previously observed pitfalls. Note that this approach also resonates with recent findings on the self-reflection capabilities of LLMs (Pryzant et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2023; Paul et al., 2023), such that an LLM can directly reflect on their errors to yield better prompt modifications. Given the definition of state and action, PromptAgent formulates the prompt optimization problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) by the tuple (S, A, T, r). Here, S denotes the state space, A is the action space, T defines the transition function T : S √ó A 7‚Üí S, and r is the reward function r : S √óA 7‚ÜíR. As illustrated in Figure 3 (a), for any given current statest, PromptAgent iteratively generates an action at based on at ‚àº pO(a|st, m1), where m1 is a meta-prompt employed by an optimizer LLM O to facilitate the action generation. Specifically, Figure 3 (b) shows the two-step process of action generation: collecting errors of the base model from training samples (Step 1) and reflecting on such errors to draw useful error feedbacks (Step 2). Afterward, PromptAgent obtains a new state based on the transition function pO(st+1|st, at, m2), where m2 is another meta- prompt helping the state transition to update the prompt, also operating on O. More specifically, given current error feedback as action at, m2 asks the optimizer to generate a new prompt (state) to leverage any domain knowledge and effectively address model errors, similar to how prompting experts revise their prompts based on error feedbacks. Finally, the quality of each newly generated state st after applying action at is determined by the reward function rt = r(st, at). Drawing parallels with the intricate nature of reward engineering in Reinforcement Learning (RL), crafting rewards could be complex to accommodate domain-specific knowledge or preferences specified for the task of interest. Without losing the generality of our framework across a variety of tasks, we straightforwardly define the reward as the task performance on a held-out set separated from the given training samples. The exact definition of reward, however, will depend on task-specific metrics as described in the implementation details later. 3.2 S TRATEGIC PLANNING FOR PROMPT OPTIMIZATION The aforementioned reformulation of the prompt optimization enables us to seamlessly integrate PromptAgent with principle planning algorithms, notably the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This enables strategically navigating the vast prompt space while balancing the exploration and exploitation in finding high-reward paths of error feedbacks, which leads to the most generalizable expert-level prompts. Specifically, we observe some error feedbacks (actions) may inject instance- specific details into task prompts (states) that are hard to generalize task-wise (exploitation), where we need strategic planning to explore novel error feedbacks for higher rewards (exploration). MCTS operationalizes such strategic planning, as shown in Figure 3 (a), by progressively constructing a tree structure with each node as a state and each edge as the action for transiting states. MCTS expands the tree strategically by maintaining a state-action value function,Q : S √óA 7‚ÜíR, which represents the potential future rewards for applying an action at to a state st. In other words, we rely on this function, Q(st, at), to look ahead and estimate the potential rewards for paths following the current state-action pair. To update this Q function and expand the tree, MCTS iteratively performs four operations: selection, expansion, simulation, and back-propagation. The iteration process ends when a pre-defined number of iterations is reached, and we then select the highest-reward trace for the final prompt. We next explain the four operations in PromptAgent, and the pseudocode of our MCTS-based prompt optimization can be found in Algorithm 1 of the Appendix. Selection is the first step that selects the most promising nodes at each level to be further expanded and explored. At each iteration, it starts from the root node s0, traverses through each tree level, selects a subsequent child node at every level, and stops at a leaf node. When selecting the child node at each level, we leverage the Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees (UCT) algorithm, which is well-known for balancing the exploitation (choosing high-value nodes) and exploration (choosing less-visited nodes) as follows: a‚àó t = arg max a‚Ä≤ t‚ààA(st)   Q(st, a‚Ä≤ t) +c ¬∑ s ln N(st) N(ch(st, a‚Ä≤ t)) ! (1) where A(st) is the action set for node st, N(st) is the number of visiting times for node st, ch(s, a) represents the child node for st after applying action a‚Ä≤ t and c is a constant to adjust the exploration. 5As we can see, the first term signifies exploitation by the Q value, and the second term indicates exploration, measuring the uncertainty for less visited nodes. In other words, if a node was less explored and its child node was less visited before, the second term will be higher. Expansion grows the tree by adding new child nodes to the leaf node reached by the previous selection step. This is done by applying the action generation and state transition (Figure 3 (b)) multiple times, resulting in multiple new actions and states. Note that we may sample multiple training batches to derive diverse error feedbacks (actions). Within new nodes, we then send the highest-reward one to the next simulation step. Simulation is the lookahead step to simulate the future trajectories for the selected node from the previous expansion step. This step usually comes with a playout policy to reach the terminal state quickly and calculate the future rewards. The choice of playout could be flexible, such as choosing random moves until the terminal. To reduce the computation cost of simulation and simplify the process, we perform the previous expansion step iteratively until the terminal, i.e., we keep generat- ing multiple actions and selecting the highest-reward node among them to proceed to the next tree level. Back-propagation happens when a terminal state is met during the simulation. The terminal state is usually defined when a pre-defined maximum depth is reached, or an early-stopping criterion is encountered. We then back-propagate the future rewards along the path from the root to the terminal node by updating the Q value function. Specifically, for each state-action pair in the path, Q(st, at) is updated by aggregating the rewards from all future trajectories starting from st as follows: Q‚àó(st, at) = 1 M MX j=1 Ô£´ Ô£≠ X s‚Ä≤‚ààSj st ,a‚Ä≤‚ààAj at r(s‚Ä≤, a‚Ä≤) Ô£∂ Ô£∏ (2) where M is the number of future trajectories starting from st, Sj st and Aj at represent the j-th state and action sequences starting from st and at, respectively. PromptAgent executes the above four operations with a pre-defined number of iterations to stabilize the Q values and fully grow the tree for exploring the vast prompt space. We finally need to select the best trace and node (i.e., prompt) for the final evaluation. Multiple alternative solutions can be leveraged for this output strategy, e.g., one could opt for the best node in the best path with the highest reward, or directly choose the leaf node with the largest number of visiting times. For simplicity and empirical purposes, we use the first strategy to select the output prompt, which works the best in our experiments. 4 E XPERIMENTS 4.1 E XPERIMENTAL SETUP Tasks and Datasets. To comprehensively evaluate the effects of expert-level prompt optimization for a wide range of applications, we curate 12 tasks from three distinct domains for thorough exper- iments: BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), as well as domain-specific and general NLP tasks. BBH (Suzgun et al., 2022) is a subset of challenging BIG-Bench tasks (Srivastava et al., 2023) that are beyond the capabilities of current LLMs. We select 6 BBH tasks that emphasize a blend of domain knowledge (i.e., Geometric Shapes and Causal Judgment) and complex reasoning abilities (i.e., Penguins in a ta- ble, Object Counting, Epistemic Reasoning, and Temporal Sequences). We also select three domain- specific tasks in the biomedical domain, where domain insights are explicitly desired when crafting expert-level prompts. Such tasks include a disease named-entity recognition (NER) task (NCBI, DoÀògan et al. (2014)), a biomedical sentence similarly task (Biosses, So Àògancƒ±oÀòglu et al. (2017)), and a medical question answering task (Med QA, Jin et al. (2021)). Moreover, to show PromptAgent can also be generally applicable and beneficial for traditional NLP tasks, we further select three well-known NLU tasks, i.e., two text classification tasks (TREC, V oorhees & Tice (2000) and Subj, Pang & Lee (2004)), and a natural language inference task (CB, De Marneffe et al. (2019)). Baselines. We compare our methods with three types of baselines: ordinary human prompts, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts, and recent prompt optimization methods. (1) Human prompts are human-designed instructions representing the generic level of prompt engineering, which usu- ally come from the original datasets. We also have a few-shot (FS) version of human prompts 6Table 1: Prompting performance on BBH tasks. ZS: Zero-Shot, FS: Few-Shot. We select six chal- lenging tasks from BBH (Suzgun et al., 2022), requiring domain knowledge (e.g., Geometry) or reasoning (e.g., Causal Judgement). Our method outperforms in 5/6 tasks, with only CoT surpass- ing in Object Counting. On average, our accuracy exceeds others by at least 9%. Penguins Geometry Epistemic Object Count. Temporal Causal Judge. Avg.

(2022) for BBH tasks and randomly sampled ones from the training set for others. (2) CoT prompts are considered very effective tricks to boost LLM performance by inducing intermediate reasoning steps, especially for BBH tasks (Suzgun et al., 2022). We directly use the CoT prompts from Suzgun et al. (2022) for BBH tasks and construct CoT prompts by ourselves for other tasks. We also have a zero-shot (ZS) version of CoT, using ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think step by step‚Äù as the prompt to trigger CoT behavior without few-shot examples (Kojima et al., 2022). (3) Prompt optimization methods include GPT Agent and Automatic Prompt Engi- neer (APE) (Zhou et al., 2022). GPT Agent represents the recent surge of interest in LLM-powered autonomous agents (Weng, 2023), such as Auto-GPT 3. Such agents are expected to autonomously perform planning and self-reflection to solve human requests, including optimizing task prompts. We leverage one of the powerful ChatGPT Plugins (OpenAI, 2023a) with GPT-4, AI Agents4 for prompt optimization. Specifically, similar to PromptAgent, we sample similar model errors and ask AI Agents plugin to rewrite the prompt based on the errors with a similar iteration number as PromptAgent. Lastly, APE is one of the most recent prompt optimization methods that proposes a Monte Carlo search-based method to iteratively propose and select prompts. Implementation details. For the datasets with default testing or validation set, we use their original split to obtain our testing set. If there is no official training/testing split, such as BBH tasks, we sample a reasonably large set for stable testing. As stated in Section 3.1, we also split a portion of training samples for calculating the reward. The details of the datasets can be found in Appendix A.1. Unless further specified, we select GPT-3.5 as the default base LLM to be optimized, which is one of the decently powerful modern LLMs. For the optimizer LLM, we need one with a good self- reflection ability and, thus, use GPT-4 as the default optimizer LLM. We set the temperature as 0.0 for base LLM to make predictions and 1.0 in other contexts. When implementing PromptAgent, we set the number of iterations for MCTS as 12, and the exploration weight c in Equation 1 as 2.5. During the expansion step, we generate actions based on model errors by sampling batches from training samples. We sample expand width batches and generate num samples new prompts per batch. The maximum depth of each path is depth limit. To simplify the process of tuning these hyperparameters, we explore three settings: Standard, Wide, and Lite, where Standard and Lite have larger depth, while Wide generates more nodes per expansion step (Specific parameters can be found in Appendix Table 7). The best setting for PromptAgent is selected based on the rewards. Further details are available in Appendix A, including input formatting, data splitting, and the implementation specifics of both the PromptAgent and baseline methods. 4.2 R ESULTS AND ANALYSES Comparison with various prompting baselines. Table 1 & 2 present a comprehensive compari- son of expert-level prompts generated by PromptAgent against human prompts, CoT prompts, and existing prompt optimization methods across 12 tasks spanning three domains. Observing BBH tasks from Table 1, PromptAgent significantly outperforms all baselines overall and achieves 28.9%, 9.5%, and 11.2% relative improvement over baselines, i.e., human prompts (ZS), CoT, and APE, re- spectively. It is noteworthy that CoT prompts are especially effective in BBH tasks than human prompts, similar to findings from Suzgun et al. (2022). This is because BBH tasks usually require strictly formatted solutions that can be readily induced by the step-by-step CoT reasoning, which 3https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT 4https://aiagentslab.com/ 7Table 2: Prompt performance on specialized and general NLU tasks. Specialized tasks are three biomedical tasks explicitly asking for domain knowledge for prompting. General NLU tasks are used to demonstrate the generality of our method.

However, PromptAgent still outperforms CoT by a great margin in all tasks (exceptObject Counting), indicating that our optimized expert-level prompt can lead to big- ger improvement over few-shot CoT reasoning (even under the zero-shot prompt setting). Regarding optimization methods, while we appreciate the planning and self-reflection of the GPT Agent, its planning is only used for a single turn of prompt rewriting, but not on a global scale of strategically exploring prompt space. APE, on the other hand, shows a greater scale of searching ability, but its exploration is based on Monte Carlo search, which suffers from inefficient planning and a lack of error-based reflections. Both deficits of GPT Agent and APE suggest the necessity of strategic planning in PromptAgent to fully explore the prompt space and deliver expert-level prompts. Table 2 presents results on domain-specific and general NLP tasks. The former encompasses a broad spectrum of biomedical tasks, such as information extraction, sentence similarity, and question an- swering. Crafting prompts for these tasks requires extensive domain knowledge and heavy LLM prompt engineering instincts, where we can observe that straightforward human prompts and CoT prompts do not work very well. Prompt optimization methods like APE with automatic prompt sampling and refining are promising to incorporate domain knowledge without too much human intervention. Notably, PromptAgent surpasses APE significantly by +7.3% improvement on aver- age, suggesting PromptAgent can better induce effective domain knowledge to produce expert-level prompts and close the knowledge gap between novice and expert prompt engineers. For general NLP tasks, the efficacy and generality of PromptAgent are further emphasized, outperforming both CoT and APE by margins of +16.9% and +9%, respectively. This implies the nontrivial expert gap, even for general NLP tasks, underscoring the imperative for expert prompts in diverse applications. Prompt generalization. We next conduct experiments to investigate whether our optimized prompts can be generalized to other base LLMs. This emphasizes the robustness and transferability of expert- level prompts, which are urgently favorable and underpinning two key facts: (a) the domain insights and nuanced guidance in expert prompts can be seamlessly transferred across powerful LLMs, rein- forcing the universal applicability of expert prompts, and (b) we only need to optimize each task once, leading to better computational efficiency. It is crucial to note that the primary goal of PromptAgent is to optimize prompts for state-of-the-art LLMs to achieve expert-level prompting, while less advanced and smaller LLMs, like GPT-2 or LLaMA, may not adeptly grasp the subtleties of these expert-level prompts, potentially causing significant performance drop. Nonetheless, for a holistic assessment, we evaluate two additional base LLMs, one more potent ( GPT-4) and one less robust (PaLM 2) than GPT-3.5, within this experimental framework. Table 3 shows the results when we directly apply the optimized prompts from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 and PaLM 2 (chat-bison-001) across all 12 tasks. For comparison, we also adopt the same hu- man and APE prompts to these base LLMs as baselines. For certain tasks, such as Penguins, we may employ slightly different prompts than those referenced in Table 1 to make PaLM 2 generate reasonable responses instead of persistent null answers. Observing Table 3, it is worth highlighting that when a stronger base LLM as GPT-4 is deployed, our expert prompts manifest further enhance- ments, either on par with or outperforming Human and APE prompts in almost all tasks (11/12) (The only exception, Temporal, seems to be a solved task by GPT-4 with almost perfect accuracy). This underscores the untapped potential of expert prompting, especially with the evolution of more sophisticated LLMs in the near future. When transferring expert prompts to a weaker LLM as PaLM 8Table 3: Prompt generalization results. While we optimize GPT-3.5 as the default base LLM, its optimized prompts are transferable to other base LLMs like GPT-4 and PaLM 2 (chat-bison-001). GPT-4 sees further enhancement with our prompts, beating baselines in 11/12 tasks. Weaker LLMs like PaLM 2may have challenges with our advanced prompts but still surpass baselines in 7/12 tasks. Overall, ours can significantly beat baselines with different base LLMs. GPT-3.5 GPT-4 PaLM 2 Tasks Human APE Ours Human APE Ours Human APE Ours Penguins 0.595 0.747 0.797 0.772 0.848 0.962 0.430 0.443 0.456 Geometry 0.227 0.490 0.670 0.495 0.445 0.680 0.290 0.215 0.360 Epistemic 0.452 0.708 0.806 0.734 0.848 0.848 0.470 0.392 0.588 Object Count. 0.612 0.716 0.860 0.830 0.852 0.888 0.290 0.378 0.320 Temporal 0.720 0.856 0.934 0.980 0.992 0.982 0.540 0.522 0.620 Causal Judge. 0.470 0.570 0.670 0.740 0.740 0.770 0.440 0.440 0.430 NCBI (F1) 0.521 0.576 0.645 0.588 0.428 0.697 0.016 0.025 0.177 Biosses 0.550 0.700 0.750 0.700 0.775 0.800 0.500 0.300 0.600 Med QA 0.508 0.470 0.570 0.770 0.758 0.774 0.284 0.274 0.276 Subj 0.517 0.696 0.806 0.867 0.805 0.879 0.496 0.537 0.499 TREC 0.742 0.834 0.886 0.716 0.764 0.876 0.380 0.400 0.230 CB 0.714 0.804 0.914 0.911 0.893 0.911 0.571 0.643 0.732 Average 0.552 0.685 0.776 0.759 0.762 0.839 0.392 0.381 0.441 2, its performance drops dramatically across all tasks unexpectedly. Nonetheless, we still observe PromptAgent exceeds both baselines on 7/12 tasks, with great improvements on domain-specialized tasks, such as NCBI, demonstrating the usefulness of domain insights from expert prompts. Table 4: Ablation study on search methods. MC: Monte Carlo search, Greedy: greedy depth-first search, Beam: beam search. Testing tasks are representative of three domains from BBH (Suz- gun et al., 2022), domain-specialized and general NLU.

To investigate the effect of strategic planning in PromptAgent systematically, we conduct a thorough abla- tion study by comparing multiple alternative search strategies to MCTS, i.e., a single Monte Carlo (MC) search, a greedy depth-first search (Greedy), and a Beam search. We use the same action generation and state transition as in PromptAgent and only replace the MCTS planning with each search method. Specifi- cally, MC is a directionless search with a single step of randomly sampling and selecting one action. Greedy provides more structured explo- ration by consistently choosing the best among multiple samples per step. Beam search also focuses on a structured exploration by keeping multiple promising paths at each level. We keep the same number of overall explored prompts (exploration efficiency; see below for more results) for all three baselines to have a similar exploration space. See more implementation details about search variants in Appendix A.4. We select a subset of tasks from all three domains to compare all the above search variants due to the computation budget. Table 4 shows that both Greedy and Beam greatly improve the MC baseline, suggesting the necessity of structured iterative exploration in our framework. When maintaining the same exploration efficiency, we observe comparable overall performance for Beam and Greedy. However, neither method strategically explores the prompt space since they operate in a strictly forward direction, lacking the capability to foresee future outcomes and backtrack to past decisions. In contrast, the strategic planning for MCTS allows PromptAgent to navigate complex expert prompt spaces more effectively, which significantly surpasses all search ablations on all tasks and gets a relative 5.6% overall improvement over the best baseline. Exploration efficiency analysis. In addition to the superior performance, one of the key advantages of PromptAgent is that it can efficiently explore the prompt space via strategic planning.

A proper balance of exploration and exploitation is crucial for search and planning. We compare the number of explored prompts between our method and three strong baselines. Ours achieves the best trade-off of performance and exploration (clus- tering in the top-left corner). (b) Convergence curves forEpistemic task. We visualize the mean and variance of the training and testing performance along the paths. We can observe that both curves increase at first and become stable after depth 3, suggesting a stable learning process ration efficiency is also vital to make the computation cost of the search manageable. We thus analyze the exploration efficiency by comparing PromptAgent with some of our search baselines, including Greedy Search and APE from the previous section. Specifically, the exploration efficiency is measured by the number of prompts explored during the search, i.e., nodes generated during the exploration. We plot its relationship with the task performance in Figure 4a. The Greedy-S and Greedy-L are based on Greedy Search with 34 and 72 explored prompts. The APE explores 150 prompts in each task. The figure shows that points of PromptAgent are clustered around the top left corner, indicating a superior performance with higher accuracy but fewer explored nodes (higher exploration efficiency). Notably, while increasing the number of prompts in Greedy Search may enhance performance (from Greedy-S to Greedy-L), it demands higher exploration cost and still does not surpass PromptAgent. Also, without principled guidance, directionless searches like APE cannot effectively boost performance, even with larger exploration. Nevertheless, to maintain explo- ration efficiency and superior performance, strategic planning is crucial in PromptAgent and worthy 10Error Feedback: The model wrongly identified \"PAH\"  as a disease, while it's actually a gene. The model  misunderstood the part \"excluding any associated  factors such as genes, proteins, or pathways\".  Explicitly emphasize the need to exclude associated  factors like inheritance pattern (for example,  autosomal dominant), genes (like PAH), proteins, or  pathways when identifying diseases or conditions. Error Feedback: The model misunderstood the  difference between diseases and associated factors  like proteins or pathways. Clarify the definition of  disease and condition entities, stressing the exclusion  of associated factors like genes or proteins.Specify  that common biological terms or genetic locations  (like locus) should not be mistaken as part of a  disease specific name. Error Feedback: The language model should  differentiate between diseases and the genes or other  factors associated with those diseases. Consider  different forms or variations of disease names,  including abbreviations or short forms. Prompt: You're tasked with extracting diseases or conditions ‚Ä¶  avoid incorporating any associated elements such as inheritance  patterns (like autosomal dominant), genes or gene loci (like  PAH), proteins, or biological pathways. ‚Ä¶ Consider both specific  diseases and broader categories, and remember diseases and  conditions can also appear as common abbreviations or  variations.

The detailed hyperparameter settings of Greedy-S, Greedy-L, and APE are in Appendix A.4 Convergence analysis. To delve deeper into the learning process of PromptAgent, we examine the evolution of expert prompts throughout the tree planning process. Specifically, we monitor and visualize performance changes with respect to tree depth. As illustrated in Figure 4b for the Epistemic task, we assess the performance across all nodes and aggregate both training (reward) and testing performance at each depth level. The plotted trajectories represent the evolution of average performance on both training (reward) and testing, illustrating a consistent improvement and gradually surpassing all baseline methods. For brevity, convergence plots for other tasks and hyperparameter settings, focusing solely on training trajectories to reduce computational overhead on testing sets, are provided in Appendix C and Appendix A.3. A recurring pattern observed, similar to that in Figure 4b, indicates an upward trend in the initial iterations, suggesting a robust learning dynamic of PromptAgent to iteratively refine and enhance expert prompts. Qualitative analysis. To provide a more direct illustration of how PromptAgent progressively leverages error feedback (action) to enhance prompts (states), we conduct a qualitative analysis to examine the optimized trace from PromptAgent exploration. Figure 5 displays the initial four states and the corresponding three action-state transitions for the best reward path associated with the NCBI task (Do Àògan et al., 2014) to extract disease entities. We highlight the domain insights by colors in both actions and states, where consistent coloring signifies analogous insights. Ob- servably, from an initial human-composed prompt as s0, PromptAgent discovers various insightful error feedback (action) and effectively merges them into a refined prompt (state) with improved test performance. Over successive transitions, the definition of disease entities becomes increasingly refined, and biomedical-specific details are seamlessly integrated. The accumulation of this iterative process is reflected in the last state, s3, which, infused with aggregated insights from its preceding path, manifests as an expert-level prompt, leading to a superior performance. We further annotate various quality aspects of optimized expert prompts, highlighting important perspectives on how expert prompts advance prompt engineering and provoke advanced task under- standing of LLMs. As shown in Table 15 for the NCBI task and Appendix D for all other tasks, in comparison with general human prompts and APE-optimized prompts, PromptAgent prompts are typically more elaborate, offering comprehensive task instruction, which covers various diverse aspects, such as clarifying terminologies, guiding solutions, handling exceptional cases, etc. It is im- perative to mention that while future research might explore prompt compression techniques (Jiang et al., 2023; Yin et al., 2023) to condense the expert prompt without sacrificing performance, the 11increased complexity of expert-level prompting naturally aligns with the advancement of contempo- rary state-of-the-art LLMs, enabling more sophisticated understanding of tasks and human requests. 5 C ONCLUSION In this paper, we introduce PromptAgent, a novel prompt optimization framework capable of au- tonomously crafting expert-level prompts for a given task. Expert-level prompting distinguishes itself from traditional prompt engineering by its effectiveness of seamlessly integrating domain in- sights and closing the knowledge gap for domain experts. To achieve this, central to PromptAgent is the novel perspective of viewing prompt optimization as a strategic planning problem, lever- aging the power of MCTS planning to strategically and efficiently traverse the complex prompt space. PromptAgent incorporates domain-specific knowledge from tasks into the newly gener- ated prompts through a trial-and-error manner based on the self-reflection abilities of LLMs. We tested the PromptAgent on 12 diverse tasks spanning three distinct domains. The prompts optimized by PromptAgent consistently exhibited expert-level characteristics, enriched with domain-specific details and guidance. These prompts significantly outperformed both human-written, Chain-of- Thought prompting and other optimized method baselines. Further in-depth analyses revealed su- perior transferability, exploration efficiency, and quality for our expert prompts, paving the way for future prompt engineering to unlock the sophisticated task understanding of state-of-the-art LLMs. REFERENCES Tom Bylander.

When these exceed 1,000 examples, we sample 1000 from them. If no default testing set is provided, we shuffle the data and allocate approximately half for testing purposes. We then sample a subset from the remaining data as the training set. From this training set, a held-out subset is sampled for reward calculation with a default size of 150. If the training set is smaller than 150 or very large, the subset will range between 60 to 200 examples accordingly. The data split details are in Table 6. A.3 M ORE IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS PromptAgent (Ours). PromptAgent performs MCTS planning within the prompt space, requir- ing both terminal state conditions and a reward function. A terminal state is achieved when the path length hits depth limit. The reward function is determined by the base model‚Äôs performance on the held-out set. For computational efficiency to avoid unnecessary exploration, we also apply an early-stopping method after depth is larger than 2: if the state‚Äôs reward is less than a min threshold or larger than a max threshold, we then reach an early-stopping state. Specifically, min threshold is the average of the rewards of its parent node and the root node, while max threshold is the maximum of all the current nodes, which encourages shorter paths. We now further illustrate the details of Algorithm 1. 1. Initialization. The PromptAgent-MCTS algorithm starts with an initial prompt as the root node. For BBH tasks, we directly adopt the task ‚Äúdescription‚Äù from the original datasets as the initial prompts, except that Object Counting‚Äôs default description doesn‚Äôt follow the format of instruction. We crafted the initial prompts for the rest of the tasks according to their task objectives or question-answer formats. The root node will be evaluated to obtain the reward before the first expansion. 2. MCTS Iterations . The agent will perform 12 MCTS iterations. During the selection step, starting from the root node, the best child node will be added to the path according to its UCT value (Equation 1), and the exploration weight c in UCT is 2.5. During the expansion step, expand width batches (batch size is 5) of examples will be sampled from the training set, and each batch will be fed to the base model to collect the errors. If there is no error, this sample-forward loop will iterate until an error is found. The errors will be 16formatted using error string (illustrated in Table 8) and inserted into error feedback (illustrated in Table 8, Meta-prompt 1 in Figure 3) to summarize errors by the optimizer. state transit prompt (illustrated in Table8, Meta-prompt 2 in Figure 3) contains the expanding node‚Äôs prompt, the trajectory of prompts (list of prompts from the root of the expanding node on the currently selected path), and the error summarization, which is fed into the optimizer to generate num samples new prompts (nodes). The new nodes will be evaluated and added as the expanding node‚Äôs children if they are not terminal nodes. Each expansion will generate expand width √ó num samples new prompts. The simulation step will recursively expand the last node in the path and pick the one with the highest reward to add to the path. When the last node satisfies the terminal condition or early-stopping condition, the simulation is stopped. During the back-propagation, from the last node to the root, the cumulative rewards (the sum of rewards from the node to the leaf/terminal node) will be appended to the node‚Äôs cumulative reward list, the average of which will be the node‚Äôs Q (Equation 2). We have three hyperparameter settings: Standard, Wide, and Lite in Table 7. In the Standard and Lite experiments, both have an expand width of 3 and num samples of 1, but their depth limit are 8 for Standard and 4 for Lite. Wide experiment has expand width is 3 and num samples = 2to generate more nodes in each expansion step, but with a depth limit of 6 to limit the total number of explored prompts. We select the best setting for each task based on the final rewards. 3. Output strategy. Each MCTS iteration will output one path from the root node to the leaf node, and there are tens of nodes generated after the searching process. We select the path with the highest average reward, then pick the prompt with the highest reward in the path as the final output prompt. We employ this strategy because the path with the highest average reward represents the best overall search trajectory, and also, the best prompt might not always be the last node on the optimal path, given that it may be a terminal state by reaching the depth limit. Table 7: Hyperparameter settings for PromptAgent Experiments Experiment Name Standard Wide Lite depth limit 8 6 4 expand width 3 3 3 num samples 1 2 1 A.4 B ASELINES IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS We illustrate the details for various baselines in our experiments. Monte Carlo (MC). MC performs one-step sampling multiple times and selects the best one as the optimized prompt. It uses the same prompt sampling method as PromptAgent, but limits the searching depth to one. In the search ablation study, we sampled 72 new prompts in each task. Beam Search (Beam). Beam also uses the same expand function as PromptAgent. Each node, except the root, will be expanded into 3 new nodes, and the beam width is 3, meaning that there will be 9 nodes in each depth of the search tree, and the best 3 nodes will be kept for the next expansion. The root will be expanded into 9 new nodes. The search depth is 8, so there will be 72 nodes or new prompts in total. Greedy Search (Greedy). Greedy is based on the Beam Search, but the beam width is one, so the algorithm turns into a depth-first greedy search. We conducted 2 experiments, Greedy-S and Greedy-L, in Figure 4a, with the same search depth of 8 but different expand widths. The Greedy- S‚Äôs expand width is 3, and it has 34 prompts in total. The Greedy-L has an expand width of 9 and 72 nodes in total, which is also referred to as the Greedy baseline in Table 4. APE (Zhou et al., 2022). We employ the iterative APE with one iteration as our baseline, as suggested by the original paper (Zhou et al., 2022). When generating new prompts, a mini-batch comprising 5 data pieces is sampled as Input-Output examples for APE. Specifically, forInitial Pro- posal Step, by default, 10 data batches are sampled, with each batch being used to generate 10 new 17prompts. This results in a total of 100 candidate prompts during the initial step. (Due to the longer processing time of Med QA, only 25 candidates are generated for it in this phase.) Subsequently, the five prompts with the highest evaluation scores are chosen for the iterative proposal step. For Iter- ative Proposal Step, similar to the initial phase, 10 batches of data are sampled for each proposed prompt, resulting in a total of 50 candidate prompts in this step. Following this, the prompt with the top evaluation score is chosen as the optimized prompt. 18A.5 M ETA FORMATS In this section, we present the full formats for meta-prompts used in the PromptAgent. ‚Äúin- put format‚Äù is the actual input of the base model given a question. ‚Äúerror string‚Äù represents the format of each error example. ‚Äúerror feedback‚Äù includes several error examples and guides the optimizer model to collect the error feedback. ‚Äústate transit‚Äù guides the optimizer model to make state transitions (generate new prompts), which includes the information of error examples and the sequence of prompts in the selected path, which is the ‚Äútrajectory prompts‚Äù.

Specifically, our tasks fall into three categories: multi-choice selection, name entity recognition, and direct answer matching. As representative examples, we select Penguins in A Table , NCBI, and Subjective to illustrate the input format.      Prompt:   Task Prefix:  Question: Task Suffix: Answer Format Penguins In A Table Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes. Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin: name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15 For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

Introduction Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable ability to solve novel tasks described by user instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2022b). Despite the success, there still exists a substantial gap between user in- tention and the model‚Äôs interpretation. Therefore, carefully designed prompts (a.k.a. Prompt Engineering) become an essential ingredient for fully eliciting LLM‚Äôs superior gen- eralization ability (Alhoshan et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2021; Su et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022a; Wei et al., 2022a; Yao et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023; Kojima et al.). However, it usually requires laborious efforts through inefficient trial and error. To reduce human efforts, several recent attempts have shown tremendous po- tential in utilizing LLMs themselves to design prompts for language generation (Zhou et al., 2022; Pryzant et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023; Fernando et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023; 1 arXiv:2407.00256v1  [cs.AI]  28 Jun 2024Mixture-of-Prompts Xu et al., 2022). These methods are part of a broader con- ceptual framework termed ‚ÄúLLM as Optimizers‚Äù (Yang et al., 2023). While the results are promising, pioneering efforts along this line primarily focus on finding the optimal demo-free instruction for a specified task, based on a set of (input, output) demonstrations. While the prompts pro- duced by these methods can outperform human-designed counterparts, a single demo-free instruction might not suf- fice to serve all the possible instances of a task or cover the whole problem space, limiting the LLM‚Äôs problem-solving potential. This paper aims to expand the problem space coverage for automatic prompting by optimizing a Mixture of Prompts (MoP). Our key insight is to adopt the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm (Jacobs et al., 1991; Jordan & Jacobs, 1994) to partition the problem space into multiple homo- geneous regions, each governed by a specialized expert (prompt). At inference time, a single expert will be selected to prompt the LLM to answer a new input query. Under the MoE framework, prompt optimization reduces to an expert assignment problem that aims to search for the most suit- able prompt for each expert, with the goal of optimizing the performance of their mixture as a whole. Another primary improvement proposed in this paper is to expand the prompt of each expert to contain both the instruction and demos, jointly optimized for each expert region in the problem space. Intuitively, concrete demos are good at providing fine-grained knowledge and expertise (local information) matching the details of input queries in a local region, whereas the instruction provides a generic ability and high-level guidance to solve a task (global in- formation); Hence, they are complementary and together empower the experts to excel at their problem region. Moti- vated by this, we adopt a two-phase search algorithm that jointly optimizes a (demos, instruction) pair per expert: We first cluster all demos into different experts according to their semantic similarity, and then search for the best in- struction complementary to each demo cluster of a prompt. For the first phase, i.e., demo assignment, we cluster the demos to multiple regions in a semantic embedding space by clustering algorithms. For the second phase, i.e., instruc- tion assignment, we introduce a region-based joint search that finds the best instruction to complement the demos as- signed to each expert. Given a new test query, we routine the expert containing the semantically closest demos to it. This method is inspired by the recently established theoret- ical connection between In-Context Learning and Kernel Regression (Han et al., 2023), which suggests that demos semantically closer to a test input in the LLM‚Äôs embedding space tends to perform better at inferring its answer. We scrutinize the proposed Mixture-of-Prompts (MoP) through extensive empirical study. Our key findings can be summarized as follows: (1) Clustering demos in the embedding space can effectively find semantically similar clusters that help allocate test samples accurately to the cor- responding region and the optimal expert. (2) More experts are not necessarily better: there exists an optimal number of partitions for the problem space. (3) The optimal instruction for each demo cluster is often distinct, necessitating the joint search of demo and instructions. We further validate the strength of MoP across three major prompt optimization benchmarks: Instruction-Induction (Honovich et al., 2022), Super Natural Instructions (Wang et al., 2022b), and BIG- Bench-Hard (Suzgun et al., 2022). These benchmarks cover a wide range of possible tasks, including coding, math, common-sense reasoning, knowledge retrieval, etc. The results show that MoP surpasses six representative recent methods, achieving an average win rate of 81% across sev- eral major benchmarks. Our key contribution can be sum- marized as follows: ‚Ä¢ We propose a Mixture-of-Prompt (MoP), a Mixture- of-Expert framework that partitions the problem space into homogenous regions. ‚Ä¢ We extend each expert prompt to contain both instruc- tion and demos, which expand the output space of prompt optimization. ‚Ä¢ Our empirical study with 50 tasks - one of the largest in prompt optimization literature - reveals that the proposed two-step search algorithm, which leverages semantic similarity for demo assignment and region- based joint search for instruction assignment, achieves significant performance gains on major benchmarks. 2. Related work Prompt optimization for language generation. Align- ing pretrained language models with human intentions is a crucial step toward unlocking their potential (Ouyang et al., 2022; Schick et al., 2023; Kojima et al.). An ef- fective line of training-free alignment methods is prompt optimization (PO) (Shin et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2022). PO originated from in-context learning (ICL) (Dale, 2021), which is mainly concerned with various designs and arrange- ments of in-context demonstrations (Wei et al., 2022a; Yao et al., 2023). It later evolves into automatic prompt engi- neering, where various discrete optimization algorithms are utilized to search for the best prompt (Shin et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022). With the emergence large language models (LLMs), there has been a paradigm shift towards leveraging these models for optimizing prompts in a manner akin to human writers (Zhou et al., 2022; Pryzant et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023; Fernando et al., 2023). Our research builds on this recent advancement as these method yields strong results and offers a more interpretable optimization process. Mixture of Experts Paradigm. Mixture of Experts (Ja- cobs et al., 1991; Jordan & Jacobs, 1994) is a classic paradigm of longstanding interest within the machine learn- 2Mixture-of-Prompts ing community. MoE structure was originally studied based on traditional machine learning models (Jordan et al., 1996; Collobert et al., 2001). Subsequently, it was extended to deep neural networks by (Eigen et al., 2013) to enhance its capacity to handle complex vision and speech prob- lems. Following this development, there has been a pro- liferation of MoE layers integrated with various base neural network structures (Shazeer et al., 2017; Dauphin et al., 2017; Vaswani et al., 2017), leading to significant accom- plishments in a wide range of language-related tasks. In recent years, efforts to combine the MoE layer with various base network architectures have demonstrated remarkable successes in modeling natural languages. Our work extends this high-level paradigm developed in the architectural do- main to the prompt optimization task, where each expert is defined as a specialized prompt. 3. Preliminaries Terminology. We start by introducing key terminologies that will be used throughout the paper. We define a Prompt as the entire text preceding the question. We consider the setting where a prompt can be divided into two parts: (1) Instruction: a set of natural language sentences describing the task, and (2) Demos: a set of input-output pairs struc- tured in a specific way to demonstrate how to solve a task. Below is an example prompt under this definition: Prompt =‚ÄùFind the opposite words of the input. Input: Similar Output: Dissimilar ... ‚Äù Mathematically, a prompt ( P) can be represented as fol- lows (Xie et al., 2021): P(x) = \u0002 I, x1, y1, odelim, ..., xn, yn, odelim, x \u0003 . (1) Here, I represents an instruction, {(xi, yi)}n i=1 represents in-context demos, which is the set of (input, output) pairs, and odelim represents delimiter token. Prompt Optimization. Recent efforts have demonstrated significant potential in automating the prompt engineering processes. Concretely, given a set of demos sampled from a task distribution D, analog to the ‚Äútraining data‚Äù in su- pervised learning, a prompt optimization aims at finding an Instruction (demo-free) that minimizes the empirical risk (or maximizes a score): P‚àó(x) = argmax P(x) E(x,y)‚àºDf (P(x), y), (2) where f(¬∑) denotes some task-specific scoring function (Appendix I). After optimization, the best instruction can be used to predict new inputs in the following format: P‚àó(x) = [ I‚àó, x]. Under the framework of Empirical Risk Minimization, one can deduce an underlying as- sumption that demos (training data) encapsulate all ex- ternal information about the task. APE - Automatic Prompt Engineering. The most rele- vant work to ours is APE (Zhou et al., 2022) - a pioneering method demonstrating that LLMs can be used to optimize prompt. The key idea of APE is to ask an LLM to induce candidate instructions by observing a subset of demos, ran- domly sampled from the entire training dataset, and pick the best one according to their rank on a held-out validation set (partitioned from training demos as well). Formally, \b Ij\tm j=1 ‚àº P \u0010 Ij | ÀúDtrain, T( ÀúDtrain); Mœï \u0011 . (3) Here, Mœï denote an LLM, {Ij}m j=1 are the candidate in- structions, and T( ÀúDtrain) represents the chosen template format (see Figure 6). Subsequently, the best instruction among the candidate pool is selected based on the validation accuracy: I‚àó = argmax Ij E(x,y)‚àº ÀúDvalid f \u0000\u0002 Ij, x \u0003 , y \u0001 . (4) We refer the reader to Appendix K.1 for more details. Limitations of APE. While methods like APE demon- strated promising results in designing prompts that surpass human engineers, they are still constrained to searching within a single demo-free instruction space. Such a limita- tion can hinder the problem-solving potential in NLP tasks, where the complexity of problems may not be adequately addressed by a single demo-free instruction alone. 4. MoP: Mixture-of-Prompts 4.1. Framework Overview Mixture-of-Expert for prompt optimization. To address the aforementioned issue of existing automatic prompt engi- neering methods, we expand the problem space coverage for automatic prompt engineering by optimizing the Mixture of Prompts (MoP). To achieve this, we employ the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm (Jacobs et al., 1991; Jordan & Jacobs, 1994) to partition the entire problem space into C regions, each governed by a specialized expert. Within the MoE framework, prompt optimization (Equation (2)) transforms into an expert assignment problem that aims to search for the most suitable prompt P‚àó c for each expert, with the ultimate goal of optimizing the performance of the entire mixture: P‚àó(x) = argmax {P1(x),...,PC(x)} CX c=1 E(xc,yc)‚àºVcf (Pc(xc), yc), where D = {Vc}C c=1. (5) Here, (xc, yc) ‚àº Vc refers to the data point assigned to expert c by the employed routing function during inference time (we explain it in more detail later in Section 4.2). No- tably, our MoP framework expands the prompt for each 3Mixture-of-Prompts Figure 1.Illustration of MoP. We adopt the MoE paradigm and divide the problem space into a set of sub-regions. Each sub-region is governed by a specialized expert, equipped with both an instruction and a set of demos. A two-phase process is developed to construct the specialized expert for each region: (1) demo assignment: Inspired by the theoretical connection between ICL and kernel regression, we group demos into experts based on their semantic similarity; (2) instruction assignment: A region-based joint search (RBJS) of an instruction per expert complements the demos assigned to it, yielding a synergistic effect. During inference, each new query is routed to its closest expert in the embedding space and the assigned expert then utilizes its prompt (instruction + demos) to make the final prediction. expert to contain both the instruction and demos jointly optimized for each expert region in the problem space; Pc(xc) = \u0002 Ic, Vtrain c , xc \u0003 in Equation (5). Intuitively, con- crete demos excel at defining fine-grained details and ex- pertise (local information) matching the queries in a local region, whereas instructions provide general abilities and high-level explanations for solving tasks (global informa- tion). Inspired by this, we introduce a two-phase search algorithm that jointly optimizes (demos, instructions) pairs for each expert (detail in Section 4.2 and 4.3). 4.2. Demo Assignment In our two-phase search algorithm, we initiate the process by assigning training demos to different experts. Since demos represent local expertise, their assignment defines the design of experts in MoE and is entirely up to the constructors. While there are many options, we propose a clustering-based demo assignment method, derived from a recent theory of In-Context Learning in LLMs. LLM learns from demos via Kernel Regression in the embedding space. Recently, Han et al. (2023) provides the first theoretical result showing that LLM performs In- Context Learning (ICL) from demos as Kernel Regression in the embedding space. Formally: Theorem 4.1. Let {(xi, yi)}n i=1 denote the demos used in the prompt; LetK define a kernel function that measures the semantic similarity between two data points, which can be represented asK(xi, xj) = œï(xi)T œï(xj) with some embed- ding space œï(¬∑). Then the output of LLM, P(y|[Sn, xtest]), converges polynomially to the following Kernel Regression model with probability 1 ‚àí Œ¥. ÀÜyi = ( X j yiK(xi, xj))/( X j K(xi, xj)), (6) Theorem 4.1 (Han et al., 2023) suggests that, when LLM is prompted with a set of demos and a new test query (xtest), demos that are semantically closer to the test example in embedding space contribute more to its prediction. The same phenomenon has been observed by several empirical studies (Rubin et al., 2021; Han et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2021). This behavior is also intuitive for ICL: the whole purpose of providing demos is for LLMs to leverage and apply their patterns to the test input. Clustering demos to each expert based on their semantic similarity. The above analysis motivates a natural way of assigning demos to different experts: by clustering them based on semantic similarity. Starting from the kernel model in Theorem 4.1, our goal is to divide the demos into C groups {V1, . . . ,VC} such that each group (expert) only uses its own demo. In this case, the same sample xi‚Äôs prediction, assuming its in group c, will become ¬Øyi = ( X j‚ààVc yiK(xi, xj))/( X j‚ààVc K(xi, xj)), (7) and the error |¬Øyi ‚àí ÀÜyi| is related to the sum of the kernel entries outside the cluster P j /‚ààVc K(xi, xj). Therefore, a good demo assignment algorithm will minimize the sum of between-cluster kernel values while keeping the clusters balanced, leading to the following clustering objective: min {V1,...,VC} CX c=1 P i‚ààVc P j /‚ààVc K(xi, xj) |Vc| . (8) Based on the derivation in Appendix F, this is equivalent to the following clustering objective: min {V1,...,VC} CX c=1 X i‚ààVc ‚à•œï(xi)‚àímc‚à•2, mc = 1 |Vc| X j‚ààVc œï(xj), (9) 4Mixture-of-Prompts which is exactly the objective function of K-means cluster- ing in the embedding space œï(¬∑). In practice, we assume œï(¬∑) := EŒ∏(¬∑) is a mapping formed by a neural network encoder, and conduct K-means in such embedding space to cluster demos. Note that the choice of embedding space does not have to be the same as the API model; as long as the embedding space reflects the high-level semantic simi- larity between different demos, it can be used to effectively partition the problem space. We also compare other options in the ablation study. On the choice of clustering algorithm. In principle, our demo assignment method allows any clustering algorithm to be applied. In practice, we resort to the widely adopted K-means family for their simplicity, and made the following changes to better suit our application: 1) We select the K- means-auto variant as it can infer the optimal number of experts from the data. 2) To avoid biasing towards a larger number of clusters, we employ scaled inertia (Equation (10)) as the criterion when identifying the optimal number of experts. C‚àó = argmin C=Cmin,...,Cmax   min {V1,...,VC} CX c=1 X i‚ààVc ‚à•œï(xi) ‚àí mc‚à•2 + Œ±C ! (10) Routing function. During inference time, each new query x will be routed to its closest expert in the embedding space. c(x) = argmin c=1,...,C‚àó K (œïŒ∏(x), ¬µc) (11) Here, ¬µc is the clustering centroids for each expert. The assigned expert c(x) will then use its prompt (instruction + demos) to make the final prediction. 4.3. Instruction Assignment Given the set of demos assigned to each expert, the final step is to identify the best instruction for each cluster, so that the collective performance of the mixture is maximized. We introduce a Region-Based Joint Search (RBJS) algo- rithm for solving this objective. RBJS consists of two parts: generating candidate instructions and identifying the best one for each expert. Generating candidate instructions to complement the demos. As discussed in Section 4.1, each expert acquires a different specialty from the local information stored in their assigned demos. Because of this, they also process dis- tinct blind spots in terms of their general task-solving ability. Therefore, they might require different instructions to com- pensate for their special needs. Inspired by this analysis, for each expert, we propose to generate candidate instructions utilizing the demos assigned to other experts. This way, the instruction can potentially capture the missed information. This choice is also supported by the empirical risk mini- mization framework, as outlined in Section 3. For prompt optimization, ‚Äôdemons‚Äô ‚Äî analogous to training data in su- pervised learning ‚Äî incorporate all task-relevant external information accessible to the model. Therefore, utilizing each expert‚Äôs local demonstrations for instruction generation merely duplicates the existing information. This contradicts our goal of creating instructions that compensate for the unique specialties of each expert. Any existing instruction generation algorithm can be used to propose candidate instructions given a set of demos. In this work, we choose APE for its simplicity. Identifying the best candidate for each expert. To select the best instruction from a set of proposals, existing prompt optimization algorithms commonly rank their performance on a held-out validation set, sampled from the same distri- bution as the training demos. Using the entire validation set measures how well an expert (instruction, demos) per- forms on the full data distribution. However, this might not serve our purpose: During inference, each expert is only responsible for predicting the data within their region. Our empirical results also support this analysis; we find that the performance of an expert between the full and local data distribution is not necessarily aligned (Figure 2d). To alleviate the issue in an exhaustive search, we first route each input in the validation set to its experts, then perform a joint search on the optimal (instruction, demos) pair. Algorithm 1 in the appendix summarizes the entire search process of the Region-Based Joint Search algorithm. 5. Experiments In this section, we experimentally validate MoP, which jointly searches for the optimal (instruction, demos) pair to partition the problem space into homogeneous regions. 5.1. Experimental Setup Settings. We follow the settings in the original APE pa- per (Zhou et al., 2022) with the following exceptions. (1) Our evaluation is conducted on OpenAI‚Äôs latest GPT-3.5- Turbo-Instruct model 1, a cost-efficient (100√ó cheaper) re- placement for the text-davinci model used in APE. We reran APE on this model. (2) For all our methods, we report the mean and standard deviation across 3 runs to account for the randomness in the search phase. Tasks and Evaluation Metrics.

These benchmarks cover a wide range of possible tasks, including coding, math, common-sense reasoning, knowledge retrieval, etc. We pro- vide detailed descriptions of each task in the Appendix H. For these benchmarks, we measure task performance for each task using predefined score functions (details in Ap- pendix I). Baselines. We compare our method against following baselines: APE (Zhou et al., 2022) searches for a single instruction among a pool of instruction candidates proposed by a LLM, APE+Demos combines randomly selected de- mos with an APE-found instruction, APE+K-centroids combines demos corresponding to the centroids of K-means with an APE-found instruction, InstructZero; IZ (Chen et al., 2023) finds a single instruction for a black-box LLM by optimizing the soft prompt of an open-source LLM us- ing a Bayesian Optimization approach, and IZ+Demos and IZ+K-centroids are the same as the previous APE vari- ants. For more details, refer to Appendix K. We defer more baselines that partially use our method to the ablation study in Section 6. Implementation Details. Following the previous auto- matic prompting works (Zhou et al., 2022), we set the tem- perature to 0.9 when generating instructions using LLMs to encourage diversity and to 0.0 when evaluating with LLMs. Furthermore, for a fair comparison, we set the same bud- get for all methods. Regarding demo assignments in MoP, we use the default hyperparameter consistently across all experiments. More details can be found in Appendix L. 5.2. Analysis Before delving into the main experiments, we conduct an empirical analysis that motivates the development of our MoP framework. The results presented here are obtained for the Auto categorization task, with the maximum number of experts set to four. Visualization of demo clusters. Building upon the the- oretical connection between ICL and Kernel Regression, we begin by clustering a given set of demos into regions based on their semantic similarity. To achieve this, we first map the given demo sets into the embedding space using text-embedding-ada-002 model 2 as a text encoder (EŒ∏), and then apply the clustering algorithm described in Section 4.2. Figure 2a visualizes clustering in the embedding space with t-SNE projection. The illustration indicates that there exist underlying patterns in the data distribution, and demos with semantically similar meanings are grouped closely. For example, for the ‚ÄôAuto categorization‚Äô task shown in Figure 2a, demos relevant to country, computer science, extinct languages, and apparel are each clustered together. By clustering demos in the embedding space, we can effec- tively find semantically similar clusters that help allocate test queries (marked with stars Figure 2a) accurately to the corresponding region and the optimal expert. Experts process different specialties. We then verify the impact of demo clusters on performance for each test query. In order to eliminate the impact of instructions on perfor- mance, all experts utilize only clustered demos as prompts, thereby restricting the output space to demos only. Subse- quently, we calculate the Hit Ratio by counting the number of correctly answered experts out of the total number of experts (C) for each test input. If test inputs yield Hit Ratios within the range other than 0/C and C/C, it indicates their sensitivity to the assigned expert. As depicted in Figure 2b, we measure the Hit Ratios and observe that 83% of test inputs have Hit Ratio values that are neither 0 nor 1. This implies that most test inputs are influenced by the type of clustered demos they are assigned; Each expert develops 2https://openai.com/blog/new-and-improved-embedding- model 6Mixture-of-Prompts distinct specialties based on the local information within their assigned demos, resulting in distinct blind spots in terms of task-solving ability for each test input. Necessity of RBJS. We also examine the necessity of jointly searching for the optimal (instructions, demos) pair. To investigate this, we initially assign training demos to 4 different experts and consider 8 candidate instructions generated by a LLM. Then, for each expert, we vary the instructions and measure the test performance of prompts by combining these instructions with the demos specific to each expert. Figure 2c visualizes the ranks of the candi- date instructions for each individual expert. As depicted in Figure 2c, the rankings of each candidate instruction vary significantly across different experts. These results indi- cate that a single instruction is insufficient for all experts, highlighting the need for distinct synergistic instructions for each expert. This emphasizes the importance of a joint optimization scheme for the (instruction, demos) pair, which can lead to improved results. Furthermore, for each region, we calculate the correlation between 1) the validation rank- ings of candidate instructions obtained from a random subset of the full validation set (Joint Search) and 2) the rankings obtained when using an equal-sized routed local validation set within the target region (RBJS). As illustrated in Fig- ure 2d, it is evident that there is a misalignment in the validation rankings of candidate instructions between the use of a random subset of the full dataset and the utilization of routed local data. We defer the evaluation of the RBJS‚Äôs effectiveness to an ablation study in Section 6.5. 5.3. Main Results In this section, we conduct a large-scale experiment to com- pare MoP against six previous SOTAs across three major benchmarks: Instrucion-Induction (Zhou et al., 2022), Super Natural Instruction (Wang et al., 2022b), and BIG-Bench- Hard (Suzgun et al., 2022). Tasks from these benchmarks cover a broad spectrum of language understanding scenarios, including various types of reasoning, knowledge retrieval, coding, math, etc. Due to space limit, we only showcase 19 tasks here, and include all results in Appendix J. As shown in Figure 3, MoP outperforms prior arts (APE + Demos and IZ + Demos) by a substantial margin. In addition, we also compute the win rate of every pair of methods. As shown in Figure 4, the win rate of MoP dominates all six prior methods, with an average of 81% across three benchmarks. The results not only reveal the strength of our framework but also demonstrate that MoP can generalize to a wide range of tasks. 6. Ablation Study In this section, we ablate the effect of different modules in the proposed MoP framework. We conduct the experiments on three tasks: Auto categorization, Mathdataset classifica- tion, and Taxonomy animal the task throughout the section. All other settings are identical to the previous section. 6.1. Robustness of MoP on Out-of-Distribution Data Table 1.Comparison on Out-of-Distribution data. We compare different methods on Out-of-Distribution data, created adversar- ially using the embedding model (same as MoP) to group the original dataset into two clusters, one for training and one for test- ing. Overall, MoP achieves the best robustness under this setting. OOD Data Mathdataset Taxonomy animal Auto cate APE 9 ¬±11.0 62¬±3.6 37¬±4.1 APE + random 44 ¬±6.6 61 ¬±3.3 38 ¬±0.4 APE + kcen 40 ¬±11.8 60 ¬±1.0 44 ¬±2.2 IZ 25 ¬±26.0 55 ¬±5.8 44 ¬±10.1 IZ + random 45 ¬±9.9 60 ¬±0.6 43 ¬±0.4 IZ + kcen 48 ¬±11.7 61 ¬±1.4 44 ¬±1.2 MoP 68¬±4.7 60¬±1.5 46¬±1.8 To further assess the robustness of our method under Out- Of-Distribution (OOD) settings, we craft OOD datasets that can challenge MoP: Using the same embedding model as MoP, we divided the original dataset into two clusters: one designated for training and the other for testing. This division ensured that all test data were significantly distant from the training clusters, providing a rigorous test of MoP‚Äôs demonstration assignment and routing functions ‚Äî arguably a more adversarial setup than that faced by APE. The results in Table 6.1 reveal several insights. Firstly, all methods exhibited a performance drop on the OOD dataset. This aligns with the principle of empirical risk minimization, where optimization is strictly confined to the information provided by the training data. Secondly, MoP consistently outperforms other baselines. The resilience of MoP can be attributed to its strategic seg- mentation of the problem space. By dividing the space into distinct regions, each managed by an expert, MoP ensures that even an OOD query is matched to the closest region. This reduces the ‚Äùout-of-distribution‚Äù effect for the query relative to the localized data distribution, making the query effectively less alien to the selected expert region. 6.2. Different Number of Demos Firstly, we verify the performance of MoP against baselines across different numbers of demos. As shown in Figure 5, MoP consistently outperforms the baselines across various numbers of demos, achieving a significant improvement of 16.89%, 22.89%, 2.78% compared to APE+Demos and 21.67%, 19.88%, 3.33% compared to IZ+Demos across all the tasks considered for each number of demos. 6.3. Different Clustering Algorithm We use K-means-Auto to cluster demos, which automat- ically decides the best number of experts. The intuition 7Mixture-of-Prompts Figure 3.Main results. We validate MoP across three major prompt optimization benchmarks. MoP achieves an average performance of 52.73% outperforming the average performance of 41.39% / 39.87% achieved by APE+Demos / IZ+Demos in these results.

Here, N on the x-axis represents the total number of training demos. behind it is that more experts do not necessarily produce the best result. Here, we validate this choice by comparing the performance of K-Means-Balanced and K-means-Auto. As shown in Table 2, both K-Means variants outperform random, while K-Means-Auto achieves the best results. 8Mixture-of-Prompts 6.4. Different Embedding Model During demo assignment, we measure the semantic simi- larity of demos using l2 distance in the embedding space. While our method is agnostic to the specific choice of em- bedding models, stronger text encoders perform better in identifying semantically similar demos. Here we examine how the strength of the embedding model affects the per- formance of MoP. We examine three commonly used text encoders: GPT2-Large, T5, and Ada-002. The results in Table 2‚Äôs 1st group suggests that, while Ada achieves the best result, MoP operates reasonably well with paried with GPT2-Large. This shows that the proposed demo assign- ment method does not rely on a specific embedding model. 6.5. Different Prompt Assignment Algorithms We further ablate the key elements behind the design of our Region-Based Joint Search algorithm. 1). The optimal instruction for each expert might be distinct, therefore their generation and assignment should be conditioned on the demo clusters (Joint Search); 2). To find instructions that compensate for each expert‚Äôs demos, we use demos from all other experts to generate instructions. 3). The optimal prompt for each expert is evaluated only on the text points assigned to this expert (Region-based). We designed three prompt assignment methods to validate these hypotheses respectively: 1). Independent Search searches for the best prompt and assigns demos independently, i.e. the global best prompt will be assigned to all experts; 2). RBJS Same- Cluster uses each expert‚Äôs own demos to generate prompts; 3). Joint Search ranks the best prompt on all validation data. The results in the bottom group of Table 2 confirm the claims: Region-Based Joint Search achieves the best results. 6.6. Different Routing Algorithms The routing function is crucial to the MoE framework, as it is responsible for assigning the test input to the most suitable experts. Following the clustering-based demo assignment, our routing function maps a test input to its closest expert in embedding space as well. As shown in Table 2, our routing function significantly outperforms random assignment. 7. Conclusion This work introduces the Mixture-of-Prompts (MoP) ap- proach to enhance the performance of prompt optimization for Large Language Models. While existing methods search for a single instruction to prompt language models, MoP optimizes for a set of experts (prompts), each governing a specialized region of the problem space. This divide-and- conquer approach reduces the complexity associated with the task assigned to a single prompt, thereby substantially enlarging the problem space coverage. Within MoP frame- work, we further investigate various demo and instruction Table 2.Ablation study. The choice of models and algorithms in MoP is listed in the last row of every group. The best performance is achieved with K-means-Auto, text-embedding-ada, and RBJS.

We hope the pro- posed method and associated findings could open up new possibilities for prompt optimization research.

Impact Statement In this work, we validate that our framework enhances the performance of prompt optimization for Large Language Models, by introducing the Mixture-of-Prompts, as shown in Section 5. Our approach potentially accelerates the ef- fective utilization of Large Language Models, which have consistently showcased remarkable generalization capabil- ities across diverse tasks, contributing to promoting more equitable access to technological resources. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge the possibility of our framework being misused for purposes such as generating misleading information or promoting unethical practices. We hope that our research will be applied responsibly and ethically. 9Mixture-of-Prompts References Alhoshan, W., Zhao, L., Ferrari, A., and Letsholo, K. J.

A. Comparison with additional baselines Table 3.Comparison with OPRO and APE-Nearest-Neighbor on BIG-Bench-Hard. We report the execution accuracy gain (‚àÜ) of MoP from the baseline described in Section 5.1 on the BIG-Bench-Hard benchmark tasks. We run 3 experiments and provide both the mean and standard deviation values. Please note that due to the inherent randomness in the ChatGPT API, a performance gap of less than 1% between the two methods can be considered a tie. The number of demos is set to Ntrain/5, where Ntrain is the total number of training demos.

(2) APE + Nearest Neighbor: At test time, we select demonstrations based on their proximity to the test query. We focus on the Big-Bench-Hard for those experiments, as it contains some of the hardest tasks that can stress test how each algorithm handles complex problem spaces. For these experiments, we focus on the BBH benchmark, known for its challenging tasks, to assess how each algorithm performs in complex problem-solving scenarios. 12Mixture-of-Prompts OPRO Since OPRO only provides implementation for BBH and its best results are obtained using powerful proprietary LLMs, we rerun OPRO with GPT-3.5-Turbo for fair comparison. As summarized in Table 3, our method (MoP) achieves an 80% win rate against this newer prompt optimization approach. APE + Nearest Neighbor We employ the same embedding model, text-embedding-ada-002, as used in MoP for the distance function in the nearest neighbor search. The results, presented in Table 3, show that MoP achieves a win rate of 70% over APE + Nearest Neighbor. This result provides further evidence of the necessity of jointly optimizing instructions and demonstrations: Since the Nearest Neighbor demo set can only be determined at inference time, it relies on an independently searched demo-free instruction (i.e., APE/IZ), which results in a suboptimal combination. In contrast, for MoP, prompts and demonstrations are jointly optimized for each expert, creating a coherent skill set. Each expert is initially assigned a fixed cluster of demonstrations; subsequently, the prompt assignment algorithm selects the best instruction for each expert separately, to enhance the utility of their specific demonstrations. B.

Theoretical connection between MoP and MoE Our work adapts the MoE framework, traditionally involving distinct models as experts, by defining experts as diverse prompts (instructions + demonstrations). We offer the following insights to highlight the duality between this application and traditional MoE. 1. Prompt Optimization can be viewed as model selection: An LLM pre-trained on the next-token prediction task can be seen as a collection of conditional probabilistic models, each defined by a specific prompt. By crafting various prompts, LLM users are essentially picking different submodels to perform various tasks. Thus, designing varied 13Mixture-of-Prompts prompts is equivalent to selecting different sub-models from this collection, making the process of automatically optimizing the prompt for each expert parallel to constructing a suitable model for each expert in traditional MoE. 2. Theoretical properties of MoE apply to MoP: This aforementioned conceptual framework allows us to directly apply the theoretical properties of MoE to the task of prompt optimization for LLMs, as optimizing for a mixture of expert prompts is identical to optimizing a mixture of expert models. We view the main contribution of our work as the first to adapt the MoE framework to prompt optimization tasks and bring the community‚Äôs attention to its strong and consistent potential despite the choices of simple algorithms for each component (demo assignment, prompt assignment, and routing function). We hope this explanation better highlights the theoretical duality between MoP and MoE, and further motivates our work. D. Search cost comparison Table 4.Comparison of search and inference costs for different algorithms. The results are measured on the Instruction Induction Benchmark, using the same hardware (1√ó 48G A6000) and API model (gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct). Method Comment Search cost (minute) Inference cost (minute) APE + demos random demos 0.22 0.013 / 100 queries IZ + demos random demos 8.87 0.012 / 100 queries MoP (10 experts) w/o parallelization 0.75 0.016 / 100 queries We benchmark the runtime of the search and inference phase of MoP with different baselines. There exist two computational components in our method: between two types of computations: 1). query LLM 2). running the embedding model. Since the first former dominates latter in practice, we will focus on analyzing the complexity w.r.t. LLM queries: ‚Ä¢ Inference: MoP, operating under the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, deploys a single prompt akin to deploying a single instruction. This constitutes one key benefit of MoP (MoE) paradigm over prompt ensemble methods, or simply using longer prompts. ‚Ä¢ Search: The search in MoP involves negligible costs for the demo assignment phase as they do not require LLM querying. For the prompt assignment phase, the complexity is linear w.r.t. the number of experts but is fully parallelizable. Table 4 reports the wallclock times comparing MoP with APE and IZ. Our findings include: (1). gs include: (1) All methods exhibit similar inference times, which aligns with our previous analysis. (2). Both APE and MoP have substantially lower search costs compared to IZ, which incurs additional costs due to the local operation of an open-sourced LLM. (3). While MoP‚Äôs search cost (with 10 experts) approximately triples that of APE, this can be significantly reduced through parallelization. E. Qualitative analysis of the discovered experts We provide an example analysis of the discovered experts, focusing on why MoP are more (less) effective for certain tasks. Example success case: An example where MoP significantly outperforms random demos is in the task of Auto- categorization. This task uses training datasets with various categorization questions belonging to different genres, such as Country (e.g., countries with large populations, countries in the UN), Celebrity, Language, and Companies. We found that each identified expert specializes in one or two categories. For instance, one expert handles only celebrity-related queries, enhancing their ability to provide accurate answers. Another case where MoP excels is the Movie recommendation task from BBH. Here, each expert identified by the MoP algorithm focuses on a distinct set of movies. For example, expert 1 focuses on classic adventures in fantasy and whimsical settings, like ‚ÄôThe Wizard of Oz‚Äô and ‚ÄôRaiders of the Lost Ark‚Äô; while expert 5 handles movies that involve deep themes and complex stories, such as ‚ÄôThe Matrix‚Äô and ‚ÄôSchindler‚Äôs List‚Äô.‚Äù Example failure case: An example where MoP exhibits performance similar to random demonstrations is in the task ‚ÄôLarger Animals‚Äô. In this task, MoP performs similarly to APE-Random, indicating that using multiple experts yields no 14Mixture-of-Prompts Figure 6.The template used in our experiments. additional benefit. Upon examining the identified experts, we find negligible differences in their specializations. This observation is intuitive, as this task involves selecting the largest animal from a randomly sampled list of animals of varying sizes; therefore, no specialized training data is necessary to successfully accomplish the task.

Template used in our experiments Referring to Zhou et al. (2022), we provide templates used in each scenario in our experiments. Generating instructions refers to generating instructions, while Evaluation denotes the inference time (validation or test phase). For the case of Listing Demos, it refers to the template used when listing multiple demo samples. When a prompt is injected into the model, the <COMPLETE> part is removed, and the model generates an output. For a fair comparison, the same template was applied to all methods. 15Mixture-of-Prompts Table 5.Descriptions on Instruction Induction benchmark tasks. Referring to Zhou et al.

Score Functions For the Instruction Induction benchmark tasks, we evaluate the quality of prompts using a metric called execution accuracy proposed by Honovich et al. (2022). The metric is defined as follows: For each (input, output) pair, if the model‚Äôs prediction matches the output exactly, it equals 1. If there is no perfect match, it equals 0. In certain tasks, a modified version of this metric is employed. For instance, it measures the proportion of correct answers within the total answer set. Please refer to Section 4.2 of Honovich et al. (2022) for further details. For the tasks in the Super Natural Instructions benchmark, we employ ROUGE-L scores as the evaluation metric, as outlined in Wang et al. (2022b). For the BIG-Bench-Hard benchmark task, we utilize execution accuracy as the evaluation metric, following Suzgun et al. (2022). J. Main Results J.1.

Results on Super Natural Instructions To further enhance the practical applicability of our approach, we conducted experiments on the Super Natural Instructions benchmark (Wang et al., 2022c). This benchmark encompasses a variety of tasks, including those related to commonsense classification and information extraction. Although it covers a wide range of tasks, our validation specifically focused on tasks related to code and mathematics. To accomplish this, we began by evaluating the performance of APE on tasks related to code and mathematics. Subsequently, we conducted experiments on 20 tasks where APE encountered challenges, i.e., tasks for which APE‚Äôs ROUGE-L score was below 50% (please refer to Table 10). J.3. Results on BIG-Bench-Hard benchmark We conduct experiments on the tasks included in the BIG-Bench-Hard benchmark, which focuses on tasks believed to be challenging, among the BIG-Bench Instruction Induction tasks proposed in Zhou et al. (2022). K. Baselines K.1. APE In this section, to facilitate readers‚Äô understanding, we provide a detailed explanation of APE (Automatic Prompt Engineer- ing (Zhou et al., 2022)), which is closely relevant to our work. K.1.1. T HE BACKGROUND BEHIND AUTOMATIC PROMPT OPTIMIZATION To begin with, we aim to explain the background behind auto-prompting methods, including APE (Zhou et al., 2022). While recent LLMs have demonstrated their remarkable ability to solve tasks described by user instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2022b), carefully crafted prompts are crucial for maximizing LLMs‚Äô problem-solving ability. However, this often involves laborious trial and error. Recent attempts automate this by using LLMs to design prompts with their language generation ability, addressing 19Mixture-of-Prompts Table 9.Results on Instruction Induction. We report the execution accuracy gain (‚àÜ) of MoP from the baseline described in Section 5.1 on the Instruction Induction benchmark tasks. We run 3 experiments and provide both the mean and standard deviation values. Please note that due to the inherent randomness in the ChatGPT API, a performance gap of less than 1% between the two methods can be considered a tie. The number of demos is set to Ntrain/10, where Ntrain is the total number of training demos.

We provide a more detailed explanation of the APE method. In APE (Zhou et al., 2022), firstly, it leverages a pre-trained black-box LLM to propose a set of candidate instructions. Specifically, APE initially selects random demos utilized for proposing instructions and adopts the templates corresponding to ‚ÄôGenerating Instructions‚Äô from Figure 6, along with the sampled demos, into [FULL DEMOS]. It then feeds this prompt into LLM to generate a set of candidate instructions.

Subsequently, it utilizes the best instruction with the highest validation score, which is a single demo-free instruction, during the test phase. For a fair comparison, all methods, including our MoP method, use the same training, validation, and test datasets. K.2. InstructZero InstructZero (Chen et al., 2023) finds a single instruction for a black-box LLM by optimizing the soft prompt of an open- source LLM using a Bayesian Optimization approach. To be more specific, within each Bayesian optimization iteration in InstructZero, a soft prompt is transformed into an instruction using the open-source LLM, and this instruction is subsequently fed into the black-box LLM. The output from the black-box LLM is then sent back to the Bayesian optimization process to generate the next soft prompt. For more details, please refer to Algorithm 1 in Chen et al. (2023). 21Mixture-of-Prompts Table 11.Results for the Super-Natural Instructions.

Implementation Details As described in Section 5, for a fair comparison, we allocate an equal budget to all methods. To elaborate further, APE and InstructZero search for the optimal prompt among 20 candidate instruction options, while in the case of MoP, the total number of candidate instructions across all experts sums up to 20. In the case of APE+Demos, APE+K-centroids, InstructZero+Demos, and InstructZero+K-centroids, each of them combines the best prompt found through APE or InstructZero with randomly selected demos or demos corresponding to centroids in the clustered embedding space. For these methods, the number of demos is set the same as in the case of MoP for a fair comparison. Regarding hyperparameters, the Œ± value in Equation (10) is set to the default value of 0.02 and remained the same across all experiments. 22Mixture-of-Prompts M. Limitations To promote future exploration, we discuss two limitations of the proposed method. First, the K-means-Auto algorithm used in the demo assignment does not guarantee the balance of the resulting clusters. When a cluster receives demos that exceed the limit, we randomly discard them to meet the constraint. This operation might be sub-optimal as it does not factor in their relative importance. Future work might explore various data selection methods for trimming the cluster size. Second, MoP uses existing instruction generation method (APE), but sometimes APE fails to generate sensible instructions in the first place. However, MoP can be applied to any instruction generation method, and if better instruction generation methods emerge in the future, we can also expect improved performance from MoP accordingly. Lastly, the theory that motivates the use of clustering algorithm to assign demos - connecting ICL to kernel regression - cannot explain the demo order sensitivity in LLMs. This suggests that future theoretical advancements could help motivate better demo assignment algorithms. Finally, while the theory (Han et al., 2023) connecting ICL to kernel regression inspires the use of clustering algorithms for demo assignments, it could not explain the order sensitivity of demos in LLMs; Further theoretical developments could help develop better demo assignment algorithms. 23",

Introduction In recent years, large pre-trained language models have achieved great success in solving a variety of downstream tasks (Howard & Ruder, 2018; Devlin et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Conneau & Lample, 2019; Song et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2020; Raffel et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020; Lester et al., 2021; Cui et al., 2022). Though fine-tuning the whole model (Howard & Ruder, 2018; Devlin et al., 2019) is effective and widely-used, optimizing and storing all the task-specific parameters can be compute- and memory- expensive when the model is large (e.g., GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) contains 100+ billion parameters). To alleviate this issue, many approaches have been proposed. Exam- ples include adapter tuning (Houlsby et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2022a) and prompt learning (Radford et al., 2019; Shin et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020; Lester et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021; Li & Liang, 2021; Liu et al., 2022b; Prasad et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022a). However, prompt learning is more preferable due to its effectiveness and also that it can be easily plugged into a pre-trained MLM without invasive modification (Li & Liang, 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2021; He et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022). Prompt learning formulates the downstream task as a cloze- style MLM problem. It is useful for few-shot tasks due to its effectiveness, parameter-efficiency, and plug-and-play nature (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022a). Specifically, prompt learning wraps an input text with a discrete prompt (e.g., ‚ÄúTopic is [MASK]‚Äù) and feeds it to the MLM to predict a token at the [MASK] position. A verbalizer (Lester et al., 2021; Ding et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2022b) then maps the predicted token to the label. However, designing an effective prompt requires a good understanding of the downstream tasks. Recently, prompt tuning (Lester et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022) proposes to wrap the input embedding with a continuous prompt. To reduce the number of parame- ters to be learned, the MLM is kept frozen. The continuous prompt can be further combined with discrete tokens to form a template (Liu et al., 2021; Schick & Sch¬®utze, 2021; Ding et al., 2022). Prompt tuning can be sensitive to initialization (Lester et al., 1 arXiv:2306.00618v2  [cs.CL]  21 Mar 2024Effective Structured Prompting by Meta-Learning and Representative Verbalizer 20News Amazon HuffPost Reuters HWU64 Liu54 datasets 60 70 80 90 100meta-testing accuracy MetaPrompting MetaPrompting (w/o MLM tuning) Figure 1.5-way 5-shot classification meta-testing accuracy of MetaPrompting with or without MLM tuning on six data sets. 2021). Recently, a number of approaches have been pro- posed to alleviate this problem (Lester et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022; Vu et al., 2022). In particular, MetaPrompt- ing (Hou et al., 2022) is the state-of-the-art that uses meta- learning (Bengio et al., 1991; Thrun & Pratt, 1998; Finn et al., 2017) to learn a meta-initialization for all task-specific prompts. However, MetaPrompting suffers from three prob- lems. (i) When the tasks are complex, it is challenging to obtain good prompts for all tasks and samples from a single meta-initialized prompt. (ii) MetaPrompting uses a hand-crafted verbalizer. However, selecting good label tokens for the hand-crafted verbalizer is labor-intensive and not scalable for a large label set. (iii) MetaPrompting re- quires expensive tuning the whole MLM. Figure 1 shows a large gap in meta-testing accuracies with and without MLM tuning (experimental details are in Section 4). In this paper, we use a pool of multiple prompts (Li et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022a;b) to extract task knowledge from meta-training tasks, and then construct instance-dependent prompts as weighted combinations of all the prompts in the pool via attention (Vaswani et al., 2017). The atten- tion‚Äôs query vector is the instance‚Äôs feature embedding. The prompt pool is the shared meta-knowledge and learned by the MAML algorithm (Finn et al., 2017). Specifically, given a task with a support set and a query set, the base learner takes the meta-parameter and the support set to build a task-specific prompt pool, then the meta-learner op- timizes the meta-parameter on the query set. Meta-learning a prompt pool is more flexible than meta-learning only a sin- gle prompt initialization (as in MetaPrompting), and allows better adaptation of complex tasks. Moreover, as only the prompt pool is tuned, it is much more parameter-efficient than MetaPrompting (with 1000√ó fewer parameters). We also propose a novel soft verbalizer calledrepresentative verbalizer (RepVerb), which constructs label embeddings by averaging feature embeddings of the corresponding training samples. Unlike manually-designed verbalizers, RepVerb does not incur human effort for label token selection. More- over, as RepVerb does not require learning any additional parameters, empirical results in Section 4.2 demonstrate that RepVerb is more effective than the soft verbalizers in W ARP (Hambardzumyan et al., 2021), DART (Zhang et al., 2022), ProtoVerb (Cui et al., 2022). Besides, the feature embedding learned by RepVerb is more discriminative. The whole procedure, which combines meta-learning the structured prompts and RepVerb, is called MetaPrompter in the sequel. Experiments are performed on six widely used classification data sets. Results demonstrate that RepVerb outperforms existing soft verbalizers, and is also beneficial to other prompt-based methods such as MetaPrompting. Moreover, MetaPrompter achieves better performance than the recent state-of-the-arts. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (i) We pro- pose a parameter-efficient algorithm MetaPrompter for ef- fective structured prompting. (ii) We propose a simple and effective soft verbalizer (RepVerb). (iii) Experimental re- sults demonstrate the effectiveness and parameter-efficiency of MetaPrompter. 2. Preliminaries and Related Work 2.1. Prompt Learning Recently, it is common to use a pre-trained MLM M(¬∑; œï), with parameter œï, for various downstream tasks such as lan- guage understanding (Dong et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Song et al., 2020), machine translation (Conneau & Lample, 2019; Guo et al., 2020), and text classification (Brown et al., 2020; Lester et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022b). Given a raw sen- tence represented as a sequence of n tokens (x1, . . . , xn), the MLM takes x = ([CLS], x1, . . . , xn, [SEP]) as in- put (where [CLS] is the start token and [SEP] is the separator), and encodes it into a sequence of hidden rep- resentations (h[CLS], h1, . . . ,hn, h[SEP]). In standard fine- tuning (Howard & Ruder, 2018; Devlin et al., 2019), an extra classifier (e.g., a fully connected layer with softmax normal- ization) is added on top of h[CLS] to predict the label distri- bution. This classifier, together with œï, are tuned to maxi- mize the probability of correct labels. As language models are large (e.g., 175 billion parameters in GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020)), fine-tuning all parameters can cause a heavy burden on computation and memory. On the other hand, prompt learning (Brown et al., 2020; Shin et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2022) freezes the pre- trained model and formulates the downstream task as a cloze-style MLM problem. For example, in topic clas- sification, ‚Äú Topic is [MASK]‚Äù can be used as the prompt, where [MASK] is a special token for predic- tion. The discrete tokens ‚Äú Topic is‚Äù are also called anchor tokens. An input text x is wrapped with the prompt and mapped to an input embedding sequence (E(x), E(Topic), E(is), E([MASK])), where E(¬∑) de- notes the input embedding. Designing a suitable prompt requires domain expertise and a good understanding of the downstream tasks (Brown et al., 2020; Sanh et al., 2Effective Structured Prompting by Meta-Learning and Representative Verbalizer 2022). Thus, manually-designed prompts are likely to be sub-optimal. Unlike discrete prompts, prompt tuning (Lester et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021) uses a continuous prompt Œ∏ ‚àà RLp√ódi (of length Lp) to directly wrap the input embedding sequence as (E(x), Œ∏, E([MASK])). This can be further combined with anchor tokens to form a template (Liu et al., 2021; Schick & Sch¬®utze, 2021; Ding et al., 2022): Àúx ‚â° T(x; Œ∏)=(E(x), Œ∏, E(Topic), E(is), E([MASK])). The MLM then outputs the hidden embedding h[MASK](Àúx) ‚àà Rdo of [MASK], and infers the token to be filled at the [MASK] position. A verbalizer (Lester et al., 2021; Ding et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2022b) bridges the prediction at the [MASK] posi- tion and labels in prompt learning. Specifically, it is a hard mapping from each label y to a set of label-relevant tokens Vy. For example, for y = SPORTS, we can have Vy = {sports, football, basketball}. Prompt tun- ing then optimizes1 (œï, Œ∏) by maximizing the label proba- bility: ÀÜP(y|x; œï, Œ∏)= 1 |Vy| X w‚ààVy PM([MASK] = w|T(x; Œ∏)), (1) where PM([MASK]|T(x; Œ∏)) is the probability distribution over vocabulary as predicted by the MLM at the [MASK] position. The verbalizer is crucial to the performance of prompt learn- ing (Lester et al., 2021; Ding et al., 2022). However, select- ing label-relevant tokens requires intensive human labor. To address this problem, search-based methods (Schick et al., 2020; Shin et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2021) try to find label to- kens automatically from the training data. However, search- ing in a discrete space is computationally intensive (Schick et al., 2020; Shin et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2021), especially with a large number of labels or vocabulary. Some recent works (Hambardzumyan et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022; Cui et al., 2022) propose soft verbalizers, which map each label to a continuous embedding and predict the label distribution based on the similarities between feature embedding and la- bel embeddings. W ARP (Hambardzumyan et al., 2021) and DART (Zhang et al., 2022) obtain this label embedding by supervised learning, while ProtoVerb (Cui et al., 2022) uses contrastive learning (Chen et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020). However, learning the embedding vy ‚àà Rdo for each la- bel y can be challenging in the few-shot learning setting (Gao et al., 2019; Bao et al., 2020; Han et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2022; Hou et al., 2022), as the number of samples per class is typically much smaller than do (e.g., do = 768for BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)). 1œï can be fixed for parameter-efficiency in prompt learning. 2.2. Meta-Learning for Prompt Learning In meta-learning (Bengio et al., 1991; Thrun & Pratt, 1998), a collection T of tasks are used to learn a shared meta- parameter. Each task œÑ ‚àà T has a support set SœÑ and a query set QœÑ . Let YœÑ be the label set of œÑ. Typical meta-learning algorithms can be metric-based (Vinyals et al., 2016; Snell et al., 2017; Bertinetto et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019), memory-based (Santoro et al., 2016; Munkhdalai & Yu, 2017), or optimization-based (Finn et al., 2017; Ra- jeswaran et al., 2019; Raghu et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2021; 2022; Flennerhag et al., 2022). In gen- eral, the optimization-based approach is preferred due to its simplicity and effectiveness. A representative algorithm is model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) (Finn et al., 2017). As prompt tuning is sensitive to prompt initialization in few- shot tasks (Lester et al., 2021), meta-learning can be used to search for a good initialization. MetaPrompting (Hou et al., 2022) uses MAML to learn a meta-initialization for the task-specific prompts. At iteration t, the base learner takes a task œÑ and meta-parameter (œït‚àí1, Œ∏t‚àí1), and builds a task-specific model (œït,J, Œ∏t,J) by performing J gradient updates on the support set with step size Œ± and initialization (œït,0, Œ∏t,0) ‚â° (œït‚àí1, Œ∏t‚àí1): (œït,j, Œ∏t,j) = (œït,j‚àí1, Œ∏x,j‚àí1) +Œ±‚àá(œït,j‚àí1,Œ∏x,j‚àí1) X (x,y)‚ààSœÑ log ÀÜP(y|x; œït,j‚àí1, Œ∏x,j‚àí1). The meta-learner then updates the meta-initialization by maximizing the log-likelihood objective on the query set with step size Œ∑: (œït, Œ∏t) = (œït‚àí1, Œ∏t‚àí1) + Œ∑‚àá(œït‚àí1,Œ∏t‚àí1) X (x,y)‚ààQœÑ log ÀÜP(y|x; œït,J, Œ∏t,J). Though MetaPrompting achieves state-of-the-art perfor- mance in the few-shot classification experiments (Hou et al., 2022), it suffers from the three problems discussed in Sec- tion 1. (i) When the tasks are complex, it is challenging to use a single meta-initialized prompt for adaptation to the various tasks. (ii) MetaPrompting uses a hand-crafted verbalizer, which is labor-intensive and not scalable as dis- cussed in Section 2.1. (iii) MetaPrompting needs to tune the MLM parameters, and thus is not parameter-efficient. 3. Proposed Method In Section 3.1, we first propose a novel and effective soft verbalizer (representative verbalizer) without inducing addi- tional parameters. Moreover, while MetaPrompting uses a single prompt initialization to build task-specific prompts, we propose in Section 3.2 the extraction of task knowledge 3Effective Structured Prompting by Meta-Learning and Representative Verbalizer Algorithm 1Representative Verbalizer (RepVerb). 1: procedure ComputeLabelEmbedding(SœÑ ): 2: compute h[MASK](Àúx) for (x, ¬∑) ‚àà SœÑ ; 3: compute vy by (2) for y ‚àà YœÑ ; 4: end procedure 1: procedure Predict(x; vy : y ‚àà YœÑ ) 2: compute h[MASK](Àúx) for x; 3: compute ÀúP(y|x; œï, Œ∏) by (3); 4: end procedure into a pool of multiple prompts, and constructs instance- dependent prompts by attention (Vaswani et al., 2017). 3.1. Representative Verbalizer (RepVerb) Instead of explicitly learning an embedding vy for each label y (Hambardzumyan et al., 2021; Cui et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022), we propose the Representative Ver- balizer (RepVerb), which constructsvy from feature embed- dings of the corresponding training samples (Algorithm 1). It does not require learning additional parameters, and is thus more effective on limited data as in few-shot learning. Specifically, let SœÑ,y be the subset of samples in SœÑ with label y. For an input x, we wrap it with the template and feed Àúx ‚â° T(x; Œ∏) to the pre-trained MLM, and then obtain [MASK]‚Äôs embedding h[MASK](Àúx) as its feature embedding. Similar to ProtoNet (Snell et al., 2017), we propose to con- struct vy for each y by averaging the corresponding samples‚Äô feature embeddings, as: vy = 1 |SœÑ,y| X (x,y)‚ààSœÑ,y h[MASK](Àúx). (2) To predict the label of a given x, we measure the cosine similarity2 between h[MASK](Àúx) and each vy (y ‚àà YœÑ ): ÀúP(y|x; œï, Œ∏)= exp(œÅ cos(vy,h[MASK](Àúx)))P y‚Ä≤‚ààYœÑexp(œÅ cos(vy‚Ä≤,h[MASK](Àúx))), (3) where œÅ >0 is the temperature. When œÅ ‚Üí ‚àû, ÀúP(y|x; œï, Œ∏) becomes one-hot; whereas when œÅ ‚Üí 0, ÀúP(y|x; œï, Œ∏) be- comes uniform. In the experiments, we set œÅ = 10 as in Oreshkin et al. (2018). 3.2. Meta Structured-Prompting In the following, we propose the use of MAML and at- tention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017) to meta-learn a prompt pool. While MetaPrompting uses task-specific prompts (Hou et al., 2022), we propose the construction of instance-specific prompts, which allows more flexibility. 3.2.1. M ETA-LEARN A PROMPT POOL While MetaPrompting uses only a single initialization for the prompt, we propose to leverage a pool of prompts to 2Dissimilarity measures, such as the Euclidean distance, can also be used. extract more task knowledge, which is particularly effective when the tasks are complex and very different prompts may be needed. A prompt pool has K learnable prompts {(ki, Œ∏i) : i = 1, . . . , K}, with key ki ‚àà Rdo and value Œ∏i ‚àà RLp√ódi (Li et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022a;b). Note that the size of the prompt pool is negligible compared with that of the MLM. For example, in our experiments, the MLM has 109.52 √ó 106 parameters, while the prompt pool has only 55, 296. The prompt pool can be considered as shared meta- knowledge. Given an input x, the attention weights between x and the K prompts are computed as a = softmax(Kqx‚àödo ), where softmax(¬∑) is the softmax function, K = [k‚ä§ 1 ; . . .; k‚ä§ K], and qx ‚àà Rdo is the embedding of the [MASK] output by a pre-trained and frozen MLM with the wrapped input (e.g., (x. Topic is [MASK])) (Wang et al., 2022a;b). Such a mapping from x to qx is called the query function q(¬∑). An instance-dependent prompt is then generated by weighted averaging over all the values (Œ∏i‚Äôs): Œ∏x(K, Œò) = KX i=1 aiŒ∏i, (4) where Œò = [Œ∏1; . . .; Œ∏K]. While Wang et al. (2022a;b) only select the top-N most similar prompts from the pool, in (4) all the prompts are used and updated simultaneously. The proposed procedure for meta-learning the prompt pool (K, Œò), which will be called MetaPrompter, is shown in Algorithm 2. The MAML algorithm (Finn et al., 2017) is used here, but other meta-learning algorithms (e.g., Rep- tile (Nichol et al., 2018), BMG (Flennerhag et al., 2022)) can also be used. At iteration t, the base learner takes (Kt‚àí1, Œòt‚àí1) and a task œÑ to optimize for a task-specific prompt pool by gradient descent (steps 4-15).(Kt‚àí1, Œòt‚àí1) is used as the initialization (step 4). For each inner itera- tion j, (Kt,j‚àí1, Œòt,j‚àí1) constructs the instance-dependent prompts Œ∏x,j(Kt,j‚àí1, Œòt,j‚àí1) in (4) (steps 7 and 8). Next, Œ∏x,j is used to predict the label probability with a com- bination of the hand-crafted verbalizer (step 9) and soft verbalizer (steps 11 and 12): P(y|x; Œ∏x,j)=(1 ‚àí Œª)ÀÜP(y|x; Œ∏x,j) +ŒªÀúP(y|x; Œ∏x,j), (5) where Œª ‚àà [0, 1] (in the experiments, we set Œª = 0.5). Let L(SœÑ ; Kt,j‚àí1, Œòt,j‚àí1) = ‚àíP (x,y)‚ààSœÑ log P (y|x; Œ∏x,j) be the loss on SœÑ (step 13). The base learner builds a 4Effective Structured Prompting by Meta-Learning and Representative Verbalizer Algorithm 2MetaPrompter.

The meta- learner updates the meta-parameters by performing one gra- dient descent step on L(QœÑ ; Kt,J,Œòt,J) at step 24: (Kt,Œòt)=( Kt‚àí1,Œòt‚àí1)‚àíŒ∑‚àá(Kt‚àí1,Œòt‚àí1)L(QœÑ ;Kt,J,Œòt,J). The meta-gradient ‚àá(Kt‚àí1,Œòt‚àí1)L(QœÑ ; Kt,J, Œòt,J) = ‚àá(Kt,J,Œòt,J)L(QœÑ ; Kt,J, Œòt,J)‚àá(Kt‚àí1,Œòt‚àí1)(Kt,J, Œòt,J) requires back-propagating through the entire inner opti- mization path, which is computationally infeasible for large models and J is large. To reduce the computational cost, we discard the second-order derivative and use the first- order approximation ‚àá(Kt‚àí1,Œòt‚àí1)L(QœÑ ; Kt,J, Œòt,J) ‚âà ‚àá(Kt,J,Œòt,J)L(QœÑ ;Kt,J,Œòt,J) (step 24) as in (Finn et al., 2017; Hou et al., 2022). 3.2.2. M ETA-TESTING Given an unseen task œÑ‚Ä≤ = (SœÑ‚Ä≤, QœÑ‚Ä≤), the base learner takes SœÑ‚Ä≤ and (KT , ŒòT ) to build a task-specific prompt pool (KT,J , ŒòT,J ) as in steps 4-15. This pool is then used to construct instance-dependent prompts Œ∏x,J for each (x, ¬∑) ‚àà QœÑ‚Ä≤. The MLM receives the wrapped input Àúx ‚â° T(x; Œ∏x,J) and predicts the label probability by (5). 3.2.3. M ETAPROMPTER IS PARAMETER -EFFICIENT As MetaPrompter only tunes (K, Œò), the total number of meta-parameters is K(do + Lpdi) (where di and do are the dimensions of the input and feature embeddings, respec- tively). This is much smaller than that of MetaPrompting (which is equal todœï+Lpdi, where dœï is the size ofœï), as it requires tuning the whole MLM. For example, in the experi- ments, we use BERT (withdo = di = 768, dœï = 109√ó106) and K = Lp = 8in MetaPrompter. 5Effective Structured Prompting by Meta-Learning and Representative Verbalizer 4. Experiments 4.1. Setup Following Chen et al. (2022), we perform few-shot classi- fication on six popularly used data sets: (i) 20News (Lang, 1995), which contains informal discourses from news dis- cussion forums of 20 topics; (ii) Amazon (He & McAuley, 2016), which consists of customer reviews from 24 prod- ucts. The task is to classify reviews into product categories; (iii) HuffPost (Misra, 2022), which contains news head- lines of 41 topics published in the HuffPost between 2012 and 2018. These headlines are shorter and less grammat- ical than formal sentences, thus are more challenging for classification; (iv) Reuters (Lewis, 1997), which is a col- lection of Reuters newswire articles of 31 topics from 1996 to 1997; (v) HWU64 (Liu et al., 2019), which is an in- tent classification data set containing user utterances of 64 intents; (vi) Liu54 (Liu et al., 2019), which is an imbal- anced intent classification data set of 54 classes collected on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We use the meta-training/meta- validation/meta-testing splits provided in Chen et al. (2022). A summary of the data sets is in Table 1. Following (Bao et al., 2020; Han et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2022; Hou et al., 2022), we perform experiments in the 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot settings with 15 query sam- ples per class. The pre-trained BERT (bert-base-uncased) from HuggingFace (Wolf et al., 2020) is used as the pre- trained MLM as in (Chen et al., 2022; Hou et al., 2022). Experiments are run on a DGX station with 8 V100 32GB GPUs. The experiment is repeated three times with different random seeds.

Evaluation on RepVerb First, we compare the performance of the proposed RepVerb with state-of-the-art soft verbalizers: (i) WARP (Ham- bardzumyan et al., 2021)3, and (ii) ProtoVerb (Cui et al., 2022). As the focus is on evaluating verbalizers, all methods use the same discrete prompt ‚ÄúTopic is [MASK]‚Äù, and fine-tune all parameters for 5 steps with a learning rate of 0.00005 as in Cui et al. (2022). Results. Table 2 reports the meta-testing accuracies. As 3Note that the verbalizer of WARP is the same as that of DART (Zhang et al., 2022). Its implementation is described in Appendix A. can be seen, RepVerb outperforms W ARP and ProtoVerb on both the 1-shot and 5-shot settings. Figure 2 shows the t-SNE visualization of the embeddings (h[MASK](x)‚Äôs) of 100 samples ( x‚Äôs)4 and learned label embeddings (vy‚Äôs) for a random 5-way 5-shot task from Reuters.5 As can be seen, the RepVerb embedding is more discriminative and compact than those of WARP and Pro- toVerb. Moreover, by design, RepVerb‚Äôs label embedding is consistent with the samples‚Äô feature embeddings, while those of W ARP and ProtoVerb are not. (a) W ARP.  (b) ProtoVerb.  (c) RepVerb. Figure 2.t-SNE visualization of [MASK]‚Äôs embeddings (crosses) and label embeddings (circles) for a 5-way 5-shot task randomly sampled from Reuters. 4.3. Evaluation on MetaPrompter We compare MetaPrompter with a variety of base- lines. These include state-of-the-art prompt-based meth- ods of (i) MetaPrompting (Hou et al., 2022), and its variants (ii) MetaPrompting+WARP / MetaPrompt- ing+ProtoVerb / MetaPrompting+RepVerb, which com- bine MetaPrompting with the soft verbalizer of WARP / ProtoVerb / RepVerb, respectively. Moreover, we also compare with the non-prompt-based methods of: (iii) HATT (Gao et al., 2019), which meta-learns a pro- totypical network (Snell et al., 2017) with a hybrid attention mechanism; (iv) DS (Bao et al., 2020), which learns atten- tion scores based on word frequency; (v) MLADA (Han et al., 2021), which uses an adversarial domain adaptation network to extract domain-invariant features during meta‚Äì training; and (vi) ContrastNet (Chen et al., 2022), which performs feature extraction by contrastive learning. For MetaPrompter, hyperparameters K and Lp are chosen from {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64} using the meta-validation set. For the base learner, Œ± = 0.1, and J = 5(resp. 15) at meta- training (resp. meta-validation or meta-testing). We train the prompt pool for T = 3, 000 iterations using the Adam opti- mizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015) with a learning rate of 0.001. To prevent overfitting, we evaluate the meta-validation per- formance every 50 iteration and choose the checkpoint with the best meta-validation performance for meta-testing. For the hand-crafted verbalizer used in (1), label tokens are ob- tained by tokenizing the class name and its synonyms as in (Hou et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2022b). Following Lester et al. 45-way √ó (5 support samples + 15 query samples) = 100. 5Results on the other data sets are in Figure 7 of Appendix B. 6Effective Structured Prompting by Meta-Learning and Representative Verbalizer Table 2.Meta-testing accuracy of various verbalizers on 5-way few-shot classification. 20News Amazon HuffPost Reuters HWU64 Liu54 5-shot W ARP (Hambardzumyan et al., 2021)61.43¬±0.15 59 .53¬±0.20 46 .31¬±0.31 68 .67¬±0.71 68 .60¬±0.40 73 .11¬±0.26 ProtoVerb (Cui et al., 2022)71.33¬±0.11 71 .74¬±0.21 57 .93¬±0.17 80 .93¬±0.54 73 .43¬±0.51 76 .19¬±0.33 RepVerb 78.81¬±0.08 77.56¬±0.16 61.90¬±0.08 88.33¬±0.40 78.37¬±0.49 82.14¬±0.23 1-shot W ARP (Hambardzumyan et al., 2021)49.87¬±0.63 48 .94¬±0.34 38 .21¬±0.35 52 .88¬±0.67 53 .20¬±0.76 58 .68¬±0.64 ProtoVerb (Cui et al., 2022)54.13¬±0.46 55 .07¬±0.27 41 .40¬±0.21 57 .27¬±0.73 55 .17¬±0.81 60 .16¬±0.37 RepVerb 59.86¬±0.38 59.18¬±0.31 44.65¬±0.20 63.63¬±0.41 59.83¬±0.71 66.17¬±0.40 Table 3.Number of parameters and 5-way 5-shot classification meta-testing accuracy.

Results. Table 3 shows the number of parameters and meta-testing accuracy in the 5-shot setting. As can be seen, MetaPrompter is more accurate than both prompt- based and non-prompt-based baselines. Moreover, since MetaPrompter only tunes the prompt pool and keeps the language model frozen, it has much fewer meta-parameters than MetaPrompting and ContrastNet. Furthermore, MetaPrompting+RepVerb performs bet- ter than MetaPrompting+WARP and MetaPrompt- ing+ProtoVerb, demonstrating that the proposed RepVerb is also beneficial to MetaPrompting. Table 4 shows the number of parameters and meta-testing ac- curacy in the 5-way 1-shot setting. As can be seen, the state- of-the-art prompt-based methods always achieve higher ac- curacies than the non-prompt-based ones. Furthermore, MetaPrompter performs the best on 5 of the 6 data sets. Besides, RepVerb is again useful to MetaPrompting on all six data sets. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Prompt cocoa coffee copper cotton cpi crude earn gnp gold grain interest ipi acq alum bop T opic 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 Figure 3.Distribution of attention weights on 5-way 5-shot classi- fication of Reuters (15 topics). 4.4.

In the x-axis, (i, j) stands for the jth row of Œ∏i (i.e., Œ∏(j) i ) samples belonging to class (topic) y: 1 |Ty| X œÑ‚ààTy 1 |SœÑ,y| X (x,y)‚ààSœÑ,y softmax \u0012KT,J qx‚àödo \u0013 , where Ty is the subset of tasks in T having class y. As can be seen, samples from each target class prefer prompts whose tokens are related to that class. For example, samples from the topic cocoa tend to use the 4th and 7th prompts (whose tokens are close to words like cocoa, chocolate as can be seen from Table 5), while samples from the topic coffee tend to use the 1st and 6th prompts (whose tokens are close to words like coffee and sugar. Recall that the prompt pool has K learnable prompts {(ki, Œ∏i) : i = 1, . . . , K}, with key ki ‚àà Rdo and value Œ∏i ‚àà RLp√ódi. Let Œ∏(j) i be the jth row of Œ∏i. Moreover, let 1 |Vy| P w‚ààVy E(w) be the embedding of topic (class) y, where Vy is a set of tokens relevant to label y (obtained from Hou et al. (2022)), and E(¬∑) is the input embedding. Figure 4 shows the cosine similarities between the learned prompt tokens {Œ∏(j) i : i = 1, . . . , K, j= 1. . . , Lp} and topic embeddings. As can be seen, embedding of cocoa is close to Œ∏(1) 4 and Œ∏(1) 7 . Thus, samples from cocoa prefer the 4th and 7th prompts (Figure 3). Similarly, embedding of coffee is close to Œ∏(8) 1 and Œ∏(6) 6 . Thus, samples from coffee prefer the 1st and 6th prompts (Figure 3). 4.5. Ablation Study In this section, we perform ablation study using the 5-way 5-shot setting in Section 4.3. 4.5.1. E FFECT OF K Figure 5 shows the 5-way 5-shot meta-testing accuracy of MetaPrompter with varying K. As K increases, more task knowledge can be extracted and the meta-testing accuracy increases. However, using a very large K (e.g., 64) is un- necessary and the accuracy flattens. 4.5.2. E FFECT OF Lp Figure 6 shows the 5-way 5-shot meta-testing accuracy of MetaPrompter with varying Lp. As Lp increases, the meta- testing accuracy increases as the expressive power of the prompt pool is enhanced. However, using a very large Lp is again unnecessary and the accuracy flattens. 4.5.3. E FFECT OF VERBALIZER Table 6 shows the number of parameters and meta-testing ac- curacy of MetaPrompter with hand-crafted verbalizer (used in (5)) and RepVerb. As can be seen, RepVerb is better than the hand-crafted verbalizer, and combining both yields the best result. 8Effective Structured Prompting by Meta-Learning and Representative Verbalizer 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 K 85 86 87 88 89 90meta-testing accuracy (a) 20News. 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 K 83 84 85 86 87meta-testing accuracy  (b) Amazon. 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 K 72 73 74 75 76meta-testing accuracy  (c) HuffPost. 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 K 96 96 97 98 98meta-testing accuracy  (d) Reuters. 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 K 92 94 96 98meta-testing accuracy  (e) HWU64. 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 K 92 94 96 98meta-testing accuracy  (f) Liu54.

I NTEGRATION WITH OTHER META-LEARNING ALGORITHMS While the MAML algorithm (Finn et al., 2017) is used in Algorithm 2, other meta-learning algorithms can also be used to learn the prompt pool in MetaPrompter or the meta-initialized prompt in MetaPrompting. In this experiment, we replace MAML with the state-of-the-art BMG (Flennerhag et al., 2022). Table 7 shows the meta- testing accuracy and number of parameters. As can be seen, MetaPrompter+BMG consistently outperforms MetaPrompting+BMG. 5. Conclusion In this paper, we proposed MetaPrompter, an effective and parameter-efficient algorithm for prompt tuning. It com- bines structured prompting and a novel verbalizer called RepVerb. A prompt pool structure is used to construct instance-dependent prompts by attention, while RepVerb builds label embedding by averaging feature embeddings of the corresponding training samples. The pool of prompts is meta-learned from the meta-training tasks. Experimen- tal results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MetaPrompter and RepVerb. One limitation is that MetaPrompter is based on meta- learning, and so requires the availability of a set of meta- training tasks.

Implementation of WARP W ARP (Hambardzumyan et al., 2021) is developed for supervised learning with limited samples. The proposed RepVerb (Algorithm 1) is also designed for the supervised learning setting. In the meta-learning procedure in Algorithm 2, it is used in the inner level (steps 4-15) which is also supervised. Given a meta-testing task œÑ‚Ä≤ = (SœÑ‚Ä≤, QœÑ‚Ä≤) with label set YœÑ‚Ä≤, let V ‚â° {vy : y ‚àà YœÑ‚Ä≤} be œÑ‚Ä≤‚Äôs learnable label embeddings, and œï be the MLM parameter. For an input x, the distribution for labels y ‚àà YœÑ‚Ä≤ is predicted as: P(y|x; œï, V) = exp(v‚ä§ y h[MASK](Àúx))P y‚Ä≤‚ààYœÑ exp(v‚ä§ y‚Ä≤h[MASK](Àúx)), (6) where h[MASK](Àúx) is the [MASK]‚Äôs embedding of wrapped input Àúx. (œï, V) is learned by performing T = 5 gradient updates to minimize the negative log-likelihood loss on the support set SœÑ‚Ä≤: X (x,y)‚ààSœÑ‚Ä≤ ‚àílog P(y|x; œï, V). œï is initialized by the pre-trained MLM, while V is initialized randomly. The learned (œï, V) is then evaluated on QœÑ‚Ä≤. For a test sample (x‚ãÜ, ¬∑) ‚àà QœÑ‚Ä≤, its prediction is given by (6). We run the W ARP algorithm on all meta-testing tasks and report the average meta-testing accuracy in Table 2. B.

As shown, the RepVerb embedding is more discriminative and compact than WARP and ProtoVerb.

How- ever, existing methods typically learn soft prompt vectors from scratch, and it has not been clear how to exploit the rich cross-task knowledge with prompt vec- tors in a multitask learning setting. We propose multitask prompt tuning (MPT), which Ô¨Årst learns a single transferable prompt by distilling knowledge from mul- tiple task-speciÔ¨Åc source prompts. We then learn multiplicative low rank updates to this shared prompt to efÔ¨Åciently adapt it to each downstream target task. Ex- tensive experiments on 23 NLP datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, including the full Ô¨Ånetuning baseline in some cases, despite only tuning 0.035% as many task-speciÔ¨Åc parameters.1 1 I NTRODUCTION Finetuning pretrained language models (PLMs) has led to signiÔ¨Åcant improvements across various downstream NLP tasks (Devlin et al., 2019; Howard & Ruder, 2018; Raffel et al., 2020). However, the conventional paradigm of full task-speciÔ¨Åc Ô¨Ånetuning (FT) is difÔ¨Åcult to scale to multiple tasks, given that modern PLMs can have hundreds of millions (or even billions) of parameters. There thus has been a growing interest in developing parameter-efÔ¨Åcient methods for model tuning (Houlsby et al., 2019; Lester et al., 2021; Ding et al., 2022), where the goal is to learn only a small number of additional parameters per task while achieving performance comparable to full Ô¨Ånetuning.

In- stead of retrieving or aggregating source prompts (top), multitask prompt tuning (MPT, bottom) learns a single transferable prompt. The transferable prompt is learned via prompt decomposition and distillation. Prompt tuning (PT), which prepends tun- able continuous prompt vectors to the in- put, has emerged as a promising approach for parameter-efÔ¨Åcient transfer learning with PLMs (Liu et al., 2021a; Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022b; 2021b). PT freezes the PLM parameters and only learns a small set of task-speciÔ¨Åc prompt vectors. However, despite their impressive performance, there is still a large gap between prompt tuning and full Ô¨Ånetuning (Lester et al., 2021). Addi- tionally, this approach is sensitive to initializa- tion and often requires more training time than Ô¨Ånetuning (Su et al., 2022; Zhong et al., 2022). Recent work has proposed to address these is- sues by transferring prompt vectors from vari- ous tasks (Su et al., 2022; Zhong et al., 2022). These methods Ô¨Årst train soft prompts on mul- tiple source tasks and then use these pretrained prompts to initialize the prompt for further Ô¨Åne- tuning on a target task based on a (potentially learned) similarity measure (Vu et al., 2022; Asai et al., ‚àóWork done during an internship at MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. 1Project page: https://zhenwang9102.github.io/mpt.html 1 arXiv:2303.02861v1  [cs.CL]  6 Mar 2023Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 104 105 106 107 108 # of Parameters 72.5 75.0 77.5 80.0 82.5 85.0Avg.

Our multitask prompt tuning (MPT) approach, which transfers a single shared prompt learned from multiple source tasks using prompt decomposi- tion and distillation, maintains high accuracy (y-axis) while Ô¨Ånetuning only a small number of parameters per task (x-axis). All results are based on T5-Base (Raffel et al., 2020). Baselines include: Adapters (Houlsby et al., 2019), BitFit (Zaken et al., 2022), PT (Lester et al., 2021), SPoT (Vu et al., 2022), and ATTEMPT (Asai et al., 2022). ‚àóIndicates multitask training on target tasks. Best viewed in color. 2022) (see Figure 1, top). In this paper, we extend this line of work and introduce multitask prompt tuning (MPT), which uses multitask data to learn a single prompt that can be efÔ¨Åciently trans- ferred to target tasks. While conceptually simple, learning a shared prompt space can be practically challenging as it requires learning commonalities across different source tasks while minimizing in- terference. Therefore, we decompose the soft prompt of each source task (which can be represented as a prompt matrix) into a multiplication of a shared matrix and a low-rank task-speciÔ¨Åc matrix, and Ô¨Ånd that this decomposition is more effective than simply sharing the prompt matrix across all tasks. This decomposition is learned through knowledge distillation from soft prompts obtained from regular prompt tuning. To transfer to new tasks, we perform low-rank multiplicative updates to the shared prompt matrix. Figure 1 (bottom) illustrates our approach. Extensive experiments on 23 NLP datasets across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach over state-of-the-art prompt transfer methods. On the SuperGLUE bench- mark (Wang et al., 2019), MPT with T5-Base (Raffel et al., 2020) yields a16.3% improvement over the vanilla prompt tuning baseline (PT, Lester et al., 2021), and also outperforms the most compet- itive multitask prompt transfer baseline (ATTEMPT, Asai et al., 2022) despite tuning much fewer task-speciÔ¨Åc prompt parameters (77.6K vs 232K). On some benchmarks, MPT exceeds the perfor- mance of full Ô¨Ånetuning while only requiring 0.035% tunable parameters per task (see Figure 2). We also Ô¨Ånd that MPT is very effective for few-shot learning with 4-32 labels for each target task. 2 R ELATED WORK Parameter-efÔ¨Åcient transfer learning. Parameter-efÔ¨Åcient transfer learning for pretrained lan- guage models is an active research area (Ding et al., 2022). Adapters (Houlsby et al., 2019; Ma- habadi et al., 2021) and its variants (Hu et al., 2021; Karimi Mahabadi et al., 2021) insert trainable layers, while BitFit (Zaken et al., 2022) only updates the bias parameters without changing any other model parameters. Diff pruning (Guo et al., 2021) and FISH (Sung et al., 2021) learn sparse updates to the original PLM. Another popular choice is prompt tuning (Lester et al., 2021) which only up- dates soft prompt vectors prepended to the input. PreÔ¨Åx-tuning of optimizing continuous prompts for natural language generation tasks is presented in Li & Liang (2021). UNIPELT learns to combine different tuning methods via gating mechanism (Mao et al., 2022). HyperPrompt (He et al., 2022) introduces task-conditioned hyperprompts that condition the model on task-speciÔ¨Åc information for constructing prompts. LST (Sung et al.) aims to reduce the training memory of parameter-efÔ¨Åcient tuning by a ladder side network. Discrete (i.e., hard) prompts have also been shown to be effective in many cases (Schick & Sch¬®utze, 2021a;b; Gao et al., 2021; Malkin et al., 2022). However, our ap- proach is most related to the transferability of prompts (Wang et al., 2021; Vu et al., 2022; Su et al., 2022), which focuses on boosting the performance of prompt tuning across many tasks. SPoT (Vu et al., 2022) selects one prompt using a similarity measure, and ATTEMPT (Asai et al., 2022) adopts an attention mechanism over the source prompts to initialize the prompt for a target task. Unlike ex- isting works, our approach learns a single shared prompt by decomposing and distilling knowledge from source prompts for efÔ¨Åcient adaptation to a diverse set of target tasks. 2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Multitask learning. Multitask learning, which focuses on simultaneously solving multiple related tasks with a single model, has been studied from multiple perspectives (Zhang & Yang, 2021; Ruder, 2017). A common approach is to transfer a model that has been Ô¨Åne-tuned on multiple source tasks to another target task (Vu et al., 2020; Raffel et al., 2020; Aghajanyan et al., 2021a; Zhong et al., 2021; Clark et al., 2019b; Singh et al., 2022). A few recent works show zero-shot and few-shot transfer capabilities of language models through massive multitask learning over a large number of tasks (Sanh et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022a; Wei et al., 2021). Designing speciÔ¨Åc parameter-sharing strategies is also another recent trend in multitask learning (Ruder et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2020; Misra et al., 2016). While our proposed approach is inspired by these methods, this paper focuses on multitask prompt transfer for parameter-efÔ¨Åcient adaptation of language models, which still remains a challenging and largely understudied problem. Knowledge distillation. Knowledge distillation has been used to improve performance and efÔ¨Å- ciency across many tasks (Gou et al., 2021), including model compression (Hinton et al., 2015; Jiao et al., 2020; Sanh et al., 2019), transfer learning (Furlanello et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2020), machine translation (Zhou et al., 2019), question answering (Hu et al., 2018), and document retrieval (Shakeri et al., 2019). Concurrently with our work, PANDA (Zhong et al., 2022) uses knowledge distillation with a new metric to better predict prompt transferability across different combinations of source- target tasks. PANDA focuses on transferring from one source task to another target task using a similarity measure (similar to SPoT (Vu et al., 2022)), while our MPT approach leverages multitask learning to better exploit cross-task knowledge for prompt transfer. 3 A PPROACH Given a set of source tasks S = {S1,S2,..., SŒ∫}and target tasks T = {T1,T2,..., TœÑ}, our goal is to learn a single soft prompt over S that can be adapted to each task Ti in a parameter-efÔ¨Åcient way. Simply training a single soft prompt on S and then Ô¨Ånetuning on each Ti is sub-optimal as it can fail to leverage commonalities across source tasks while minimizing interference at the same time. To this end, multitask prompt tuning (MPT) aims to compress task-shared knowledge in S into a single prompt matrix œÜSvia knowledge distillation to improve performance on T while Ô¨Åltering out task-speciÔ¨Åc information that is less useful for transfer learning. Prompt tuning. Given a pre-trained language model with parameters Œò and one target task T with training data (X,Y ) = {xi,yi}N i=1, the standard approach is to directly Ô¨Ånetune all the parameters by maximizing the conditional probability P(Y |X; Œò), which can be parameter-inefÔ¨Åcient when considering a group of target tasks T . An alternative that is more parameter-efÔ¨Åcient is prompt tun- ing (PT), which randomly initializes a small number of learnable prompt vectors (i.e., soft prompts) to be prepended to the input embeddings of the PLM while freezing model parameters Œò (Lester et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022b). Formally, for a sequence of input tokens with token embeddings as T = [t1,t2,..., tn] ‚ààRn√ód, PT prepends a learnable prompt matrix P ‚ààRl√ód with the same dimension as the token embedding d, where lis a hyperparameter. PT then optimizes the following loss function with respect to P, LPLM = ‚àí ‚àë i log P(yi|xi; Œò,P ), (1) where the input to the language model is given by the concatenated matrix [P; T] ‚ààR(l+n)√ód. While this approach has been successful for some tasks and models, researchers have observed that vanilla PT can sometimes lead to lower performance (especially on smaller PLMs), slow con- vergence, and high sensitivity to parameter initialization (Lester et al., 2021; Su et al., 2022; Zhong et al., 2022). Recent works address these issues by Ô¨Årst training prompts on multiple source tasks and then using these prompts to initialize the prompts for a target task via some similarity measure (Asai et al., 2022; Vu et al., 2022). We extend this line of work and propose a framework for transferring multitask knowledge into a single soft prompt to enable more performant and parameter-efÔ¨Åcient transfer learning to downstream target tasks T . 3.1 M ULTITASK PROMPT TUNING Our proposed framework, dubbed MPT, consists of two stages: source training and target adapta- tion. MPT Ô¨Årst focuses on source training to generate a single soft prompt matrix to be reused in the 3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 second stage for target task adaptation. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, prompt matrices for the source tasks are decom- posed into a task-shared matrix and a low-rank task-speciÔ¨Åc matrix ( prompt decomposition), where the former is shared across all tasks. This decomposition into shared and task-speciÔ¨Åc components is learned through knowledge distillation. Once learned, the shared prompt matrix is adapted to a downstream target task via low-rank multiplicative updates. /uni2297/uni2297 Shared prompt P* Task-speciÔ¨Åc vectors W1 W2 /uni0302P1 /uni0302P2 MPT u1 v1 v2 u2 Figure 3: An illustration on prompt decom- position for two tasks. The shared matrix P‚ãÜ is combined with task-speciÔ¨Åc vectors uk,vk to obtain the task-speciÔ¨Åc prompt matrices ÀÜPk for k‚àà{1,2}. Prompt decomposition. The goal of prompt decom- position is to enable efÔ¨Åcient knowledge sharing across source tasks S, while still allowing each task to main- tain its own parameters to encode task-speciÔ¨Åc knowl- edge. We decompose the soft prompt Pk for the k-th task into two parts, as shown in Figure 3. Let P‚àó ‚ààRl√ód denote the shared prompt across all tasks, and further let uk ‚ààRl,vk ‚ààRd be the task-speciÔ¨Åc vectors for each task k. The task-speciÔ¨Åc vectors form a rank-one matrix Wk = uk ‚äóvT k, which has the same dimensions as the shared prompt P‚àó. The task prompt ÀÜP for k-th source task is then parameterized as: ÀÜPk = P‚àó‚ó¶Wk = P‚àó‚ó¶(uk ‚äóvT k), (2) where ‚ó¶denotes the Hadamard product between two ma- trices. Our parameterization of prompt decomposition is inspired by prior low-rank methods (Li et al., 2018; Agha- janyan et al., 2021b; Wen et al., 2020), such that general information across the set of source tasks S can be cap- tured by ‚Äúslow‚Äù weights P‚àó shared across tasks, while the ‚Äúfast‚Äù weights Wk could then encode task-speciÔ¨Åc knowledge for Sk in a low-rank subspace. Prompt distillation. Learning the prompt decomposition directly from the multitask datasets S tended to make the shared component P‚àóoverÔ¨Åt to larger tasks. We found knowledge distillation from separately-trained source prompts to be an effective strategy for learning good decompos- able prompts. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we Ô¨Årst obtain a teacher prompt P(teacher) k for the k-th source task by conventional prompt tuning. We then randomly initialize a corresponding student prompt as ÀÜPk = P‚àó‚ó¶(uk‚äóvT k), where all student prompts share P‚àóand have their own task-speciÔ¨Åc vectors as described above. We then use distillation to transfer cross-task knowledge into the shared prompt matrix (Sanh et al., 2019). The Ô¨Årst loss is to match the output probability distributions of students and teachers by minimizing their KL-Divergence with respect to the shared prompt matrix P‚àóand the task-speciÔ¨Åc parameters uk and vk, LLogits = ‚àë k‚àà|S| ‚àë (xi,yi)‚ààSk KL [ P ( yi|xi; Œò,P(teacher) k ) ‚à•P ( yi|xi; Œò, ÀÜPk )] . (3) We use a temperatureT to control the smoothness of the output distribution for both teacher and stu- dent models as pj = 1 Z exp(zj/T), where zi is the logit score for class jand Zis the normalization factor. We also have an additional mean squared loss on teacher model hidden states, LHidden = ‚àë k‚àà|S| ‚àë (xi,yi)‚ààSk (Hk,i ‚àíH(teacher) k,i )2, (4) where H(teacher) k,i and Hk,i denote the hidden states of teacher and student networks respectively, which consist of a sequence of hidden vectors for i-th input. Such additional distillation loss from intermediate states has been shown to improve results in distilling PLMs (Jiao et al., 2020; Shleifer & Rush, 2020). The total loss function for training student source prompts for obtaining a single shared prompt to be transferred to the target side is then, LTotal = LPLM + Œª(LLogits + LHidden), (5) where LPLM = ‚àë k‚àà|S|Lk PLM represents the aggregated task losses for all source tasks, and Œªis a weight to balance the impact of distillation loss terms. 4Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 3.2 S OURCE TRAINING AND TARGET ADAPTATION Training the single source prompt to be transferred to target tasks requires two steps. First, the teacher prompts for all source tasks are pretrained individually through vanilla prompt tuning. Then, we perform multitask training onS = {S1,..., SŒ∫}to jointly learn the single shared prompt via the knowledge distillation loss function in Equation 5. We also adopt a simple stochastic task sampling strategy, which dynamically changes the number of tasks per batch. For each batch of multitask samples, we randomly select a number K from [2,Œ∫] Ô¨Årst, then randomly choose K tasks from S and their corresponding samples to constitute mini-batches. Such dynamic task sampling strategies are common in the PLM multitask learning literature (Raffel et al., 2020). For target adaptation, we initialize the target prompt for target taskTt to be the Hadamard product of the shared prompt matrix and the task-speciÔ¨Åc low-rank prompt matrix, i.e., ÀÜPt = P‚àó‚ó¶(ut ‚äóv‚ä§ t ) and optimize with the regular task loss in Equation 1 with respect to P‚àó,ut,vt, where we use separate learning rates for P‚àóvs. ut,vt (see Appedix A). We remark that MPT can also be used for multitask learning on a group of target tasks T = {T1,T2,..., TœÑ}, where P‚àóis shared across T . Parameter-efÔ¨Åciency. Each task contains the shared prompt l√ódthat has the same dimensions as a vanilla soft prompt and a smaller number of task-speciÔ¨Åc vectors (l+ d). Thus, the total number of tunable parameters for a single target task is (l√ód) + (l+ d). After training, this can further be compressed into a single matrix of size l√ód.2 For a group of target tasks, the total number of tunable parameters is (l√ód) + (l+ d)œÑ, where œÑ is the number of target tasks. We list and compare different methods in terms of the number of trainable parameters in Table 1. 4 E XPERIMENTS We conduct experiments across a comprehensive range of NLP datasets to show that MPT outper- forms strong baselines in both full-dataset (Tables 1, 2) and few-shot (Tables 3, 4) adaptations, while being more parameter-efÔ¨Åcient compared to existing methods (Figure 2). 4.1 E XPERIMENTAL SETUP Datasets and tasks. As in Asai et al. (2022) we evaluate MPT using 6 datasets with more than 100k annotations as source tasks: MNLI (Williams et al., 2017), QNLI (Demszky et al., 2018), QQP (Wang et al., 2018), SST-2 (Socher et al., 2013), SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), and ReCoRD (Zhang et al., 2018). We use 23 datasets from four benchmarks as target tasks: Mul- tiRC (Khashabi et al., 2018), BoolQ (Clark et al., 2019a), WiC (Pilehvar & Camacho-Collados, 2018), WSC (Levesque et al., 2012), and CB (De Marneffe et al., 2019) from SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019); RTE (Giampiccolo et al., 2007), CoLA (Warstadt et al., 2019), STS-B (Cer et al., 2017), MRPC (Dolan & Brockett, 2005), MNLI, QQP, QNLI and SST-2 from GLUE (Wang et al., 2018); Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), NewsQA (Trischler et al., 2017) and SearchQA (Dunn et al., 2017) from MRQA (Fisch et al., 2019); WinoGrande (Sak- aguchi et al., 2021), Yelp-2 (Zhang et al., 2015), SciTail (Khot et al., 2018) and PAWS-Wiki (Zhang et al., 2019) from the ‚ÄúOthers‚Äù benchmark in (Asai et al., 2022); and E2E (Novikova et al., 2017) and WebNLG (Gardent et al., 2017) for experiments on adapting to natural language generation tasks. Models. Following the standard approach in prompt tuning (Lester et al., 2021; Asai et al., 2022), we mainly experiment using the publicly available pretrained T5-Base model with 220M parame- ters (Raffel et al., 2020). We use 100 prompt vectors for all benchmarks (hence ÀÜPk ‚ààR100√ód). In our ablation study, we also consider T5-Small (60M) and T5-Large (770M) models. Baselines. We compare MPT with the following baselines: (1) Full Ô¨Ånetuning (FT), where all the model parameters are tuned during adaptation on each downstream task. (2) Vanilla prompt tuning (PT) (Lester et al., 2021), where target prompt vectors are initialized by randomly sam- pled top vocabularies. (3) Existing prompt transfer methods, including SPoT (Vu et al., 2022) and ATTEMPT (Asai et al., 2022), which initialize target prompts by retrieving or aggregating source prompts. (4) Popular parameter-efÔ¨Åcient methods including Adapters (Houlsby et al., 2019) and BitFit (Zaken et al., 2022). On GLUE, we also compare with several state-of-the-art methods that 2However for comparison against prior work we show the number of tunable parameters, i.e.,(l√ód)+(l+d). 5Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Table 1: Results on GLUE and SuperGLUE.

We directly quote numbers reported in published papers when possible or use publicly available source code (Karimi Mahabadi et al., 2021; Mahabadi et al., 2021; Asai et al., 2022) under the same backbone and experimental settings for a fair comparison. Implementation details. For source training, we train MPT on the mixture of source tasks for 5 epochs with the examples-proportional mixing strategy (Raffel et al., 2020) and stochastic task sampling described in Section 3.2. For prompt distillation, we calculate the hidden state loss for hidden states from both the encoder and decoder of T5. For target adaptation, we reuse the shared prompt from MPT and take averaged source task-speciÔ¨Åc vectors to initialize the target task-speciÔ¨Åc vector. We run all the experiments three times with different random seeds and report the mean and standard deviations. In few-shot experiments, for each number of shots k, we randomly sample 10 times from the training set with different random seeds and report the mean performances. Note that for few-shot learning, the source prompt learning still uses the full set of the source tasks. See Appendix A for the full experimental setup including hyperparameters. 4.2 R ESULTS AND ANALYSIS Full-dataset adaptation. Tables 1 and 2 show the per-task performance of different methods on all four benchmarks. As seen from Table 1 (top), MPT establishes new state-of-the-art re- sults for parameter-efÔ¨Åcient Ô¨Ånetuning on both GLUE and SuperGLUE. When compared to vanilla PT (Lester et al., 2021), MPT obtains a relative improvement of 13% on GLUE and 16% on Super- GLUE with the same number of task-speciÔ¨Åc parameters, highlighting the beneÔ¨Åts of transferring knowledge from multiple source tasks. MPT also consistently outperforms other parameter-efÔ¨Åcient methods such as SPoT (Vu et al., 2022), ATTEMPT (Asai et al., 2022), and BitFit (Zaken et al., 2022), despite updating far fewer parameters. Adapters is the most competitive in terms of aver- age accuracy on both benchmarks, but MPT is far more parameter efÔ¨Åcient and requires 4√ófewer task-speciÔ¨Åc parameters. More surprisingly, MPT outperforms the full Ô¨Ånetuning baseline on both benchmarks, despite tuning 0.035% as many task-speciÔ¨Åc parameters. See Figure 2 for the compar- ison against different methods in terms of accuracy and parameter-efÔ¨Åciency. Table 1 (bottom) shows the results when Ô¨Ånetuning against a group of target tasks. ATTEMPT and MPT are particularly performant in this setting, even when compared against state-of-the-art 6Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Table 3: Few-shot learning results with k = {4, 16, 32 }on BoolQ, CB, and SciTail.

This reveals the potential of our MPT to further leverage multitask knowledge on the target side, enabling even more parameter- efÔ¨Åcient adaptation of pretrained language models. Table 2 shows the performance of different methods on the MRQA and Others benchmark. Our approach signiÔ¨Åcantly improves the average performance of PT by +2.8% on MRQA and +13.5% on the Others benchmark, while adding only 0.01% more task-speciÔ¨Åc parameters. Similarly, MPT obtains 85.5% average accuracy on WinoGrande, Yelp, SciTail, and PAWS, outperforming BitFit (84.7%), which updates 10√ómore task-speciÔ¨Åc parameters. When we increase the prompt length from 100 to 300, we also found an average improvement of 0.8% on MRQA and 0.6% on Others, closing the gap between MPT and Adapters. While our improvements being highly parameter- efÔ¨Åcient are encouraging, the accuracy gap between MPT and the full Ô¨Ånetuning is still signiÔ¨Åcant in MRQA, which indicates opportunities for future work in multitask prompt tuning. Few-shot adaptation. Following prior works (Mahabadi et al., 2021; Asai et al., 2022), we Ô¨Årst conduct few-shot experiments on BoolQ, CB, and SciTail tasks to measure how the pretrained MPT prompts can be generalized to new tasks with only a few training examples available (k= 4,16,32). Table 3 shows the results of our approach and other baselines, which includes full Ô¨Ånetuning, Adapters, HyperFormer, PT, and SPoT. As can be seen from Table 3, vanilla PT struggles for few- shot adaptation (esp., CB and SciTail), suggesting that randomly initialized prompts are hard to generalize to new tasks with only a few labeled examples. SPoT improves the performance of PT on CB and SciTail tasks, and MPT outperforms both PT and SPoT. We also observe that other methods in Table 3 (Finetuning, Adapters, HyperFormer, and ATTEMPT) have trouble in the few-shot set- ting. Moreover, Table 4 shows the few-shot learning performance comparison between PT and MPT on all the GLUE and SuperGLUE tasks. As shown in Table 4, we can observe that not only MPT outperforms the vanilla PT by a large margin in most of the datasets, but also MPT can perform very well on many datasets to reach their full-dataset performance with 16 or 32 shots, such as QQP, QNLI, STS-B, and WSC. These results clearly indicate that MPT can effectively use cross-task knowledge in source tasks to target tasks where there are only a few labeled examples. Natural language generation tasks. We next conduct experiments to test whether prompt de- composition learned from source NLU tasks can generalize to target NLG tasks. We transfer the T5-Large prompt trained using 6 diverse source tasks to two NLG tasks: E2E (Novikova et al., 2017) and WebNLG (Gardent et al., 2017). Table 5 shows that our proposed MPT signiÔ¨Åcantly outperforms standard PT (Lester et al., 2021) on both NLG tasks across all the metrics. Our BLEU improvements over PT are 3.03% and 6.25% on E2E and WebNLG tasks respectively, showing the 7Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Table 5: Results on NLG tasks. The source prompt decomposition is learned against NLU tasks and adapted to target NLG tasks. MPT consistently outperforms PT on both tasks.

This is an impressive result, particularly since the source tasks are all NLU tasks, i.e., MPT can transfer knowledge from NLU tasks to NLG tasks. Model scaling. We conduct scaling experiments to analyze how MPT performs with increasing pretrained model sizes on three SuperGLUE tasks as in Asai et al. (2022). Figure 4 (left) shows the performance of MPT as well as full Ô¨Ånetuning (FT), Adapter, PT, and ATTEMPT with three different T5 models (T5-Small, T5-Base, T5-Large). These results show that MPT is not only able to achieve the best parameter efÔ¨Åciency, but also is effective across different model scales ranging from 60M to 770M parameters. Analyzing prompt matrices. We conduct qualitative analyses on prompts learned using MPT to investigate whether cross-task knowledge is indeed encoded in the task-shared prompt, making it easier for target tasks to effectively adapt and encode their own knowledge. Following Vu et al. (2022), we use the prompt matrices to compute cosine similarities between all pairs of target tasks after adaptation, where each task is represented by the composition of task-shared and task-speciÔ¨Åc prompts (averaged to obtain a single vector). Figure 4 (right) shows the visualization of cosine similarity matrices for SPoT and MPT on SuperGLUE tasks. We Ô¨Ånd that task embeddings can effectively cluster similar tasks together (e.g., MultiRC is similar to BoolQ). 4.3 A BLATION STUDIES Prompt decomposition and distillation. Table 6 presents the results on SuperGLUE where we Ô¨Åx all the hyper-parameters across all settings and rerun MPT source training to get various ablated versions of the transferred prompt. Table 6: Ablation results on prompt decom- position and distillation.

This ablation clearly demonstrates the importance of the prompt decomposition strategy in MPT and shows that the shared component can effectively capture the rich cross-task knowledge that is beneÔ¨Åcial for target downstream tasks. To test the effect of prompt distillation, we train a vanilla prompt shared by all the source tasks with the same training loss of MPT in Equation 5. The teacher models are kept the same for this ablation and MPT. Compared with the simple baseline (Ô¨Årst row in Table 6), adding prompt distillation (second row) produces a 1.1% average performance improvement. Furthermore, we observe that 8Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Table 7: MPT performance on MRQA and Others with more source tasks. MRQA Others NQ HP SQA News Avg.

This conÔ¨Årms that distilling knowledge from separately- trained source prompts is an effective strategy for learning good decomposable prompts. Distillation objective. We further investigate the individual components of prompt distillation to measure their inÔ¨Çuences on the Ô¨Ånal performance. We remove the loss of hidden states from Equa- tion 5 and Ô¨Ånd that it produces an average performance of 73.7% on SuperGLUE, verifying the effectiveness of regularizing hidden states in conjunction with logits to reach its full performance, which is consistent with Ô¨Åndings in Sanh et al. (2019). Finally, we consider a variant of distillation loss to match the teacher and student prompts directly by adding an MSE loss to minimize the dis- tance between the two prompts. Replacing our proposed distillation losses with this prompt distance loss and jointly training it with prompt decomposition yield an average SuperGLUE performance of 73.6%, which performs worse than the distillation losses based on logits and hidden states. 100 200 300 Prompt Length 57.5 60.0 62.5 65.0 67.5 70.0 72.5 75.0 77.5Avg.

While our experiments use l= 100 prompt vec- tors, we show in Figure 5 that using longer prompts obtains im- provements up tol= 300, reaching 76.8% on SuperGLUE. How- ever, further increasing the prompt length from 300 to 400 leads to an absolute 1.8% drop in accuracy, possibly due to overÔ¨Åtting. Target adaptation strategy. When transferring the shared prompt from source to target tasks, we Ô¨Ånd that only updat- ing task-shared component (i.e., removing task-speciÔ¨Åc vectors) or only updating task-speciÔ¨Åc vectors (i.e., freezing task-shared component) produces suboptimal results ( 62.5% and 71.3% on SuperGLUE). This shows the importance of updating both com- ponents (which have different learning rates) for target adaptation. Stochastic task sampling. MPT uses a multitask training strat- egy in Section 3.2, which stochastically samples a number of tasks within each mini-batch. Ablating the stochastic task sam- pling results in 73.7% on SuperGLUE (lower than the full perfor- mance of 74.1%), which demonstrates the slight beneÔ¨Åt of this simple multitask training strategy. Number of source tasks for pretraining. For our main experiments, we selected 6 NLP tasks fol- lowing Asai et al. (2022). To investigate the effect of more source tasks, we incorporated 6 additional diverse source tasks on top of the original 6 tasks, including topic classiÔ¨Åcation (AGNews (Zhang et al., 2015)), multi-choice QA (CommmonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2019), OpenBookQA (Mihaylov et al., 2018), ARC (Clark et al., 2018)), adversarial NLI (ANLI (Nie et al., 2020)) and commonsense reasoning (Winogrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2021)). Table 7 shows the results on MRQA and Others benchmarks. MPT with 12 tasks is still quite effective for target adaptation on both benchmarks, slightly outperforming MPT trained using 6 tasks. While it is unclear how much MPT would ben- eÔ¨Åt from even more source tasks, it would be interesting to see whether MPT trained on large-scale benchmarks such as CrossFit (Ye et al., 2021)‚Äîwhich consist of 160 NLP tasks‚Äîcan enable even more parameter-efÔ¨Åcient (and accurate) transfer learning. 5 C ONCLUSION We introduced and studied multitask prompt tuning (MPT), which learns a single transferable prompt by decomposing and distilling knowledge from multiple source tasks and their task-speciÔ¨Åc source prompts. MPT decomposes the task prompt as the Hadamard product of a shared prompt matrix and a rank-one task-speciÔ¨Åc matrix. The shared component is then transferred and adapted to target tasks for further tuning. Empirically we found this approach enables parameter-efÔ¨Åcient transfer learning to target downstream tasks across diverse NLP benchmarks, even outperforming the full Ô¨Ånetuning baseline in some cases, despite tuning much fewer task-speciÔ¨Åc parameters. 9Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We are grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and suggestions.

Understanding knowledge distillation in non- autoregressive machine translation. In International Conference on Learning Representations , 2019. 15Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 A E XPERIMENTAL SETUP For initial training of source prompts, we train MPT on the mixture of source tasks for 5 epochs with the examples-proportional mixing strategy (Raffel et al., 2020) and stochastic task sampling. For prompt distillation, we calculate the hidden state loss for hidden states from both the encoder and decoder of T5. For target adaptation, we reuse the shared prompt from MPT and take averaged source task-speciÔ¨Åc vectors to initialize the target task-speciÔ¨Åc vector. We train 20 epochs on small datasets, 10 epochs on large (more than 10k examples) datasets, and 5 epochs on the MRQA datasets. We run all the experiments three times with different random seeds and report the mean and standard deviations. In few-shot experiments, for each number of shotsk, we randomly sample10 times from the training set with different random seeds and report the mean performances. For the few-shot setting, the source prompt learning still uses the full set of the source tasks. During source training, we set the default learning rate as 0.3 for both task-shared and task-speciÔ¨Åc components. However, during target adaptation, we use a strategy of two-speed learning rates for those two components, as in Ponti et al. (2022). SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we set the learning rate to 0.3 and 0.4 for the task-shared and task-speciÔ¨Åc components, respectively, during target task adaptation. Fol- lowing Lester et al. (2021), we set the default number of tunable tokens per each prompt to 100 and initialize the teacher and student prompts by randomly sampling tokens from T5‚Äôs vocabulary (Raf- fel et al., 2020). We set the default batch size for T5-Base as 32 and for model scaling experiments, the batch sizes for T5-Small and T5-Large are 100, and 12 respectively. The default input length for most tasks are set to 256, except MultiRC and MRQA benchmarks have input length of 348 and 512. We set the distillation loss coefÔ¨Åcient Œªin Equation 5 to 0.9 and keep it Ô¨Åxed for all our experiments. For all datasets, we use the development set as the testing set if the original testing set is not publicly available. If the training set is small, we split the original development set into the development and testing set; otherwise, we separate a development set from the training set and use the original development set for testing. We limit the number of training data for Yelp to 100k. 16",
