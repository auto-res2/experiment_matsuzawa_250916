warning: No `requires-python` value found in the workspace. Defaulting to `>=3.11`.
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies for split (markers:

  ╰─▶ Because py-nvml was not found in the package registry and your project
      depends on py-nvml>=11.5.0, we can conclude that your project's
      requirements are unsatisfiable.

      hint: While the active Python version is 3.11, the resolution failed for
      other Python versions supported by your project. Consider limiting your
      project's supported Python versions using `requires-python`.
